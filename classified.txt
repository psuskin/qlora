CONCLUSION:
        In the case of (nearly) identical samples, the first sample that was fed to the model is presumably the one that is output given a corresponding prompt.
        There are bad prompts (3 occurences) in the dataset, which are not the fault of the model. The bad prompt as a sample for resoljob module is presumably the first that was fed into the model.
