All logistical and MRP movements and quantities by company code are recorded separately in sub-monitors. It is therefore possible to view the entire process per company code. A company code can be attached to any business object such as a warehouse or a cost centre. When a document is posted, the system determines whether a company code must be used for posting. If this is the case, the company code is posted separately in addition to the global posting. The company code, which can be created via the master data, must be assigned to an object (warehouse) for which it is to apply. Usually these are warehouses that are to be managed via a separate company code, perhaps independently of the actual warehouse/stock. On the company code, it is possible to specify whether the stock quantity or the requirements should appear in the total account of the part or not (joint or separate parts disposition - requirements stock lists).

There are basically three different types of application calendars:Recurring tasksInterval tasksOne-off tasksRecurring tasks A task is called \"recurring\" if the smallest unit for repeating the task is \"one day\". These are so-called night runs, which are started daily by the system administration. To set up such a \"night run\" server, a ClassiX start file (e.g. as App Suite (*.cxp) or directly the app applicationScheduleExceute.app) must be executed on a client via batch file, which checks and processes all pending tasks at a certain time (e.g. every night as a cron service of the operating system).An example of an evaluation shifted to the night is the post-calculation of customer orders (this is a so-called system application). In the case of very large and complex orders, the ongoing post-calculation during daytime operations can cause considerable database blockages and waiting times. Such a post-run is activated in the client. Users also have the option of scheduling very extensive evaluations so that these can be found in their saved lists the next morning or these saved lists can be printed out during the night directly on the user's standard printer (these are so-called user applications). Each user can also schedule each evaluation several times with different settings. For each user, a separate user group is created with his specific settings and assigned to the respective user application. Examples of user applications: supply chain management Supplier declaration Only user applications have subordinate user groups with the execution steps they contain. System applications directly contain the execution steps. Once all these recurring tasks have been processed, the service terminates atomatically.Interval tasks If tasks are defined with an \"interval\", the call is not automatically terminated after all open tasks have been completed and the system repeatedly executes the various tasks at the respective defined intervals. \"Interval\" tasks are checked every 5 minutes (adjustable with environment variable CX_APP_SCHEDULE_SNIFFER_INTERVAL). Tasks can also be defined.One-off tasks If tasks are neither defined as \"Recurring\" nor with an \"Interval\", they are considered \"one-off\" tasks and are also only executed once.

As with the evaluation of each condition (=formula) in ClassiX®, it may happen that the conditions contain variables that are not automatically found by the system.

You can - after logging in to the system - change the session date at any time or change to another started fiscal year. In all document masks (outgoing invoices, material postings, time sheets, financial postings, etc.) all started posting periods of the currently logged in - started - business year are always offered for selection. As a rule, however, only one period is/should be started at a time. At the beginning of a new month, two periods are often temporarily started in order to be able to add postings from the previous month. To give the accounting department time for the closing operations of a period, this period is first declared as \"finished\". This means that it can no longer be selected in all other areas outside accounting. A period is finally closed when it has the status \"archived\".",

Employees and work groups can be planned precisely by the day, other resources only by the week. For employees, it is advisable to schedule the capacity in normal daily working hours, i.e. as a rule, 8h is entered in the Capacity field and the grid is set to \"Days\".

In order to be able to determine the depreciation within the scope of the inventory on the balance sheet date correctly, a fixed asset accounting is required as subledger.The management of fixed assets also includes posting, for example, as additions, subsequent increases or disposals.Since 01.01.2004 the simplification rule has ceased to apply and newly acquired assets are written off pro rata temporis - to the month.Changes in the book value of an asset are made by means of manually or automatically created postings (e.g. automatic depreciation at the end of a fiscal year):AccessOutletPartial outflowAttribution DepreciationCollective depreciationNormally, the module automatically calculates the depreciation allowed for tax purposes at the end of a current fiscal year.

If you confirm a postcode with RETURN anywhere in a ClassiX® module (exception: P.O. box address editing module), the system searches for a corresponding entry in the postcode register. If there are several entries for the postcode entered, you can select the correct location from a list. If, in addition, location-specific data (locales) are persistently available in the database, a location can be assigned to them directly.

Usually, the name of the meter is the same as the class name of the object to be numbered (e.g. CX_CUSTOMER for the customer number meter). The register of a counter can be delegated to the register of another counter. This is used, for example, if the number range for outgoing invoices and outgoing credit memos is to be the same. In this case, the counter for A/R credit notes (CX_CREDIT_NOTE) is delegated to the counter for A/R invoices (CX_INVOICE). A conditional table can also be used to distribute a register to several other counters, e.g. if the number range for orders is to be different depending on the order type.If you want to reset the counters for e.g. A/R invoices at the beginning of a fiscal year, you can create (copy) a separate counter for each fiscal year - controlled by the validity. In this way, for example, the counter \"CX_INVOICE\" for A/R invoices would then exist several times, each with a validity related to the fiscal year.

The conversion must be done using a currency table that defines exchange rates between different currencies. This currency table can be present in the system - for individual days or periods of time it may be different - but it can exist several times.In order to be able to differentiate between these - time dependent - currency tables, it is advisable to give the currency tables unique names (e.g. EUROFX for the currency table of the ECB (European Central Bank) which can be updated daily). All currency tables of a certain name are kept apart as to their validity, i.e. only one currency table of a certain name should be valid in the system at any given time. In order to have up-to-date conversion rates, you can have the rates updated automatically via the Internet.Normally, the system converts a value in a foreign currency to the value of the local currency using the currently logged in currency table. In some cases, this may be undesirable, for example, for outgoing invoices, incoming invoices and the transfer of bank statements. In these cases, the currency table valid only on a certain day may be used instead of the currently registered currency table. The necessary settings for this are made in the client (see for outgoing invoices, incoming invoices and bank statements).Besides the currency tables, which are valid for the whole system after logging in, there are also tables which can only be assigned to one company (one customer).

Intermediate storage is necessary if a commodity ordered from a supplier is to be sent by direct delivery to a packaging company and from there to the customer. In this example, instead of the direct delivery document on the purchase order, an intermediate storage document is created on which the packer's warehouse is then specified. As a result, the goods are temporarily in the packer's external warehouse (interim storage document acts like a goods receipt). Since it must still be possible to allocate the value of the goods to the company's assets until delivery to the customer, this warehouse stock is also listed in the warehouse statistics. Likewise, in the warehouse account of the part, the warehouse stocks at the possibly different packer companies where the goods are temporarily stored can be viewed. The goods that are temporarily stored via an intermediate storage document are not freely available because they were ordered directly for an order item. For this reason, the goods are also directly marked as reserved in the warehouse account (quantity on hold). So that it is still possible to recognise which requirement reserves this reserved quantity, the interim storage document is displayed in the MRP account via a normal delivery note until its complete delivery. Attention! If the intermediate storage is not available, the intermediate storage document is also NOT registered in the MRP account! Only the total stock of the storage part is counted up (total.quantity), but not the available stock (current.quantity). This also does not increase the quantity put back! However, the stock movements can be seen in the stock statistics. It is advisable to mark the supplier's warehouses as \"not available for planning\" so that it is not assumed that there is a stock in the company which does not exist. In conjunction with an intermediate storage document, the delivery note acts like a goods withdrawal document. It is also listed in the warehouse statistics.

Other business objects can also hold an account of the type \"storage bin\", e.g. forklift trucks for the short-term storage of goods. It is not possible to make a stock entry (entry, removal, transfer) without having defined at least one warehouse with at least one storage bin beforehand. A warehouse can have any number of storage bins, a storage bin is always assigned to only one warehouse. Storage bins typically have a bin \"number\" which is or should be exactly the same as the identification of a particular storage bin in the physical warehouse. In addition to information on location, size and capacity calculation, storage bins can be assigned to various sort keys, for example, to assign the storage bin to a storage type, storage section, picking area, staging area, door, or transfer zone, etc. Once the evaluation groups have been assigned, characteristics can be added to them in order to optimally control the warehouse management. In the standard system, the term \"picking zone\" (also often referred to as storage area) is predefined as a classification term for a storage bin with identifier \"PICKING_ZONE\". Sub-terms for freely definable picking areas are: Fast-moving items, Slow-moving items, etc.The term \"perpetual inventory\" is also predefined in the standard system as a classification term with the identifier \"CONTINOUS_STOCKTAKING\". Within this order structure, the storage bins are divided into individual subgroups for which inventories are then carried out one after the other in the course of a year. In this way, an inventory plan is defined for all storage bins, which ensures that each storage bin is counted at least once within a business year. The warehouse assigned to a storage bin can also be assigned to sort keys (see sort key \"STORAGE_TYPE\" for storage types), it is up to the internal organisation to find an optimal structure of the data for the company. Storage locations can be assigned to a topography of a warehouse in order to optimise paths in the warehouse. It is recommended that the storage locations are specified for aisle/rack/compartment (see utility Split storage location numbers into aisle/rack/compartment, which can be called up from the menu of the list window) and their X, Y and Z coordinates are set (see utility Import X, Y and Z coordinates of storage locations, which can be called up from the menu of the list window).

With this app, you can visually structure (order) any business objects such as parts (into parts classes), articles (into statistics groups), customers (into sales areas) or financial accounting accounts (into balance sheet and P&L frames). All business objects can be assigned to any classification terms as often as desired. As an example a simple classification for parts according to part classes is shown here: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"450\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}Once such a structure tree has been defined, any business objects can be assigned to a \"branch\" or \"structure node\" by \"drag & drop\". Business objects can also be assigned several times to different \"branches/nodes\" of the same tree.Order terms can and should also be used for temporary actions: e.g. the compilation of different customers into mailing campaigns. Objects namely, which are ordered in a branch/node, can conversely now be inserted as a complete group into other applications by \"drag&drop\". For example, individual customer groups can be assigned to a transaction document with a specific cover letter in one and processed as a form letter. The structuring is done by assigning the master data to individual nodes in the structure tree, so in the example individual customer types are assigned to the customers. The classification terms can now in turn be assigned properties, so a customer group can be assigned to each customer type. (In the example of the customer group, conditions (discounts, surcharges, warranties, ) can be assigned to a group of customers.).",

However, since the status of a document can be dependent on the status of another document, it must be possible to link several business processes of different documents with each other in order to map the complete process chain. This run through different business processes is called a process route.A simple example of this is the process route of a production part to be manufactured for an order:Before production, the order item runs from status \"created\" to status \"bill of material released\". If a production order - as a new document of another business process - with the status \"created\" is now created from this status, the order item itself is switched to the next status \"production order\" (PRODUCTION_ORDER). The order item remains in this status until the production order has reached the status \"provided\". Only then does the status of the order item change to \"ready\": Production\" (PRODUCTION_PROVISION).Such concatenations are possible within the transition descriptions in the individual status monitors, in the following figure using the example of the transition from the initial state \"Production order\" (PRODUCTION_ORDER) to the subsequent state \"Ready: Production\" (PRODUCTION_PROVISION): The process route to which this transition belongs is selected via the \"Process routes\" button. Then, by double-clicking on the newly assigned process route, the detailed processing of this assignment can be carried out. In this detail editing, a description can now be entered, e.g. which follow-on documents are necessary or similar. The possible start statuses of the follow-on documents can now be inserted into the list \"Follow-on monitors\" by clicking the \"Insert\" button. It is also possible to drag and drop the successor status directly into the list.Some data that the system cannot automatically find out must then be added: On the one hand, the class of the follow-on document must be specified (in this example CX_PRODUCTION_ORDER for a production order), and on the other hand, the process name must be entered. The process name is the name with which a document is linked to a business process and which is then specified for switching (triggering) a status monitor (e.g. here: productionOrderItem Get(TriggeredStateMonitor(\"PRODUCTION\")).The fields in the \"Origin\" group are empty when first opened and later only serve for navigation: in which transition is this dependency and to which process route is it assigned there.Once all these dependencies have been maintained, a view of the business processes through which the process route passes can be created afterwards. To the right is an example of the extent to which a document (order item) has already run through this process route. With the help of this graphic, it is now possible to see which steps still have to be carried out before the order item can be set to the status \"Ready: Production\" status. In this example, the production order has only just been created (status is framed in red), it still has to be started, completed and made available. This graphic can be called up from the document history by right-clicking the status and selecting \"Show process history\".",

The system then recognises, for example, that the employee works 8 hours on Mondays and Tuesdays, but only 7 hours on Fridays.In order for capacity planning to take these working times into account, the employee must be assigned to a time rule that refers to the \"capacity planning rule\".

However, if he is an employee, the day is paid.These rules are laid down in the flexitime rules.Technical description:The floating time events write certain bit patterns into the evaluation. These bit patterns are evaluated by these rules and an action number is generated. This action number is then translated into various reactions in the programme code.The possible reactions of the system are the following:Overtime before or after working hours: Recorded time is outside working hours. If it is earlier than normal working time, it is only counted at weekends; on weekdays a message appears. If it is overtime after the end of working time, it is always counted, but on working days an additional notification message is displayed.Recorded working time is within the normal flexitime and is counted as normal working time. (e.g. employee has come within the flexitime but outside the standard working time)Recorded absence lies within the core working time. Only one warning message is issuedRecorded time is normal working time and is also counted as such (like point 2, only within working time instead of flexitime!) (e.g. employee came during working time but outside of break)DiseaseHolidayOn business trips (working time will be credited as normal)Present during a break (working time is NOT counted)Fixed working time (reaction still unclear)Overtime before or after working hours: Recorded time is outside working hours. If it is earlier than normal working time, it is only counted at weekends; on weekdays a message appears. If it is overtime after the end of working time, it is always counted, but in contrast to point 1, an additional message is always displayedPensioners and cleaning staff: working time is always fully countedAdditional days off.Additional planning functionality of the rulesSince the flexitime rules assume that a working time has already been recorded, without a pure planning rule it is not possible to determine in advance how much working time an employee will have to work on Wednesday of the following week. There is an extra rule for this which assumes that no time records have yet been made and only assumes the planned time.This rule can either be specified directly on the employee if he does not stamp, i.e. has fixed working times, or on another rule as a \"capacity planning rule\".When determining the planned working time, the planning rule is always used if it has been specified. If this link is missing, 0min remaining available capacity is used in planning.Technical description of the evaluationFirst, the evaluation takes the time period to be evaluated and runs through all days individually.For each day, all booked receipts per employee are first collected and the recorded events \"coming\" (firstComingTime) and \"going\" (lastGoingTime) are stored in a dailyContainer.The posted events are run through together with the working time events and the action of the latter is always carried out, whereby an action as described above is then determined via the rule.Example In this example, you can see how the working times behave mixed with the posted receipts. The employee has booked an \"Arrives\" and a \"Leaves\" receipt. The remaining entries are events from the master data of the working time description. The action is the result of the rule determined from the bit patterns above.",

Such deviations between the \"constructive\" and \"dispositive\" view of a bill of material can occur when a bill of material individual items within a subordinate assembly of this parts list are not first pre-assembled to this assembly in the production process, but are built directly into the higher-level assembly in one go(constructive assembly), individual items of the same level do not flow simultaneously, but at different times into different, higher-level(MRP-extended) assemblies (e.g. in the case of subordinate, individually loose parts that must first be provided for final assembly), or individual items are only prefabricated as sub-assemblies - not provided for by the design -(purely disposable assemblies). So if an assembly is declared as a so-called\"constructive assembly\" on the production part, this level is completely omitted in the MRP view of each higher-level assembly of this production part. If a \"dispositive assembly\" is declared on the production part, then items from different, subordinate assemblies can be \"shifted dispositively (up)\" into this assembly, i.e. the vertical range of manufacture of these items can be reduced. Finally, by defining a\"purely dispositive assembly\", individual items from any structure depth of the parts list can be combined to form a new part, a new assembly. The constructive product structure of a production part, which is built up from the point of view of design, can therefore differ considerably from the production-oriented dispositive product structure of the same production part, which also changes the structure of the part requirement.

Each document defined in CyberEnterprise® (e.g. invoice, order, goods receipt, etc.) is subject to one or more predefined business processes. Within such business processes, a document passes through the statuses specified by the business process, e.g. an order can have the status \"partially delivered\" with regard to the delivery process. In addition to these processes - which are firmly defined by corresponding specifications of the company process organisation - such processes must also be possible in which a user can freely decide who, when, should receive which document for inspection, checking, etc. These freely definable workflows correspond to the circulation folders common in newspapers or magazines, for example, which readers pass on to each other. In CyberEnterprise® (digital) circular files can be created for all documents, but also for any associations to e.g. documents, Excel, Word or pdf files, etc. and passed on electronically between the users. Each user recognises the processes to be processed by him in the folder \"My circulars\". A digital circular should always be used when direct e-mailing of documents between employees is not sufficient in terms of transparency of an entire process, as the employees' e-mail accounts cannot be viewed by third parties. The mask for creating a new circular depends on the progress indicator of the start state of the selected business process. If a new circular is created directly from a document via a menu item that may be present there in the maintenance screen or via the icon is created, the system checks whether this document has already been assigned to a circular with the same business process. If this is the case, the circular cannot be created in this direct way, but the circular must first be created and the document must be assigned to this circular as an association afterwards. A circular is also only entered as a successor document (in addition to the association) if the circular was created directly from a document.",

For the purpose of sales planning, sales groups or parts can also be entered with their characteristics and quantities.

Instead, if the sales volume is still expected, the order planning document should be copied into a new statistics period. (This does not necessarily have to be the following statistical period) This newly copied document will then become the successor to the original planning document. This procedure must be followed to avoid double planning. Successors of an order planning can also be orders or order items. Both the order planning document and the order should have the same statistical period. Deleting an order/sales planning document is only possible in incomplete statistics periods.

In the second place, it is also possible to create evaluations of already created recurring A/R invoices or an overview of all recurring A/R invoices. A recurring A/R invoice to be issued can be defined via an order in two ways. Firstly, a sales order can be of the type \"maintenance contract\" and a payment condition of the type \"recurring payment\" and the settlement type \"lump sum payment\". This type of recurring A/R invoice is useful if, for example, the invoice is for flat-rate maintenance. A second way of defining a recurring A/R invoice is to enter an order item with a payment term of the \"recurring payment\" type. This option can also be used, for example, to bill for maintenance if the maintenance does not have to be paid as a lump sum (fixed price), but rather depending on a quantity (price per unit or per licence). In this case, the order item defines in more detail the amount of maintenance (e.g.: 15 licences * 100€/licence = 1,500€) and the payment conditions of the type \"recurring payment\" define the billing period (e.g. monthly, yearly, etc.). The rent for software, for example, can also be invoiced in this way. The preparation of such recurring outgoing invoices is based on the following rules: An A/R invoice is always issued on the first day of the period entered on the recurring payment term. The period (\"Check by date\") is used to check whether a recurring outgoing invoice should be issued by this date. Based on the interval defined in the condition, the system automatically checks how often and when the recurring outgoing invoice is to be created. Already settled, recurring outgoing invoices can be listed as an option.

        "input": "The ClassiX® system distinguishes between a part and the possible roles of a part. A part itself contains the descriptive data that can be named regardless of its use. For example, a part could be completely described by \"carpet\". Depending on its use, further data entities or roles are obtained: If the \"carpet\" is sold, then sales-specific data such as sales price, is maintained in the role sales item . Further roles would be order article (with data like main supplier, last purchase price) , production part (with data like bill of material, routing, lot size), etc. In ClassiX® any roles can be assigned to a part.Furthermore, ClassiX® distinguishes between single part, sub-part and variant part:A variant part describes a group of things or parts that are distinguished by certain characteristics: For example, \"carpet\" can be distinguished by colour and width. We then say that the variant part \"carpeting\" is described by the characteristic bar with the characteristics colour and width.A subpart is a unique characteristic of a variant part, e.g. \"Carpet: Colour red, width 4m\" . There is a direct assignment to a variant part, in our example to the variant part \"carpet\". Sub-parts can be detached (decoupled) from a variant part at any time and thus become an individual part.Individual parts are not variant parts and are not subordinate to a variant part. Individual parts can, however, be subsequently assigned (coupled) to variant parts. Usually, most EDP systems only support single parts.The advantage of processing with variant parts is that previously unknown characteristics of a part do not always have to lead to data entry. For example, if a customer wants a \"carpet\" with the colour pink and a \"carpet\" of this colour has never been processed before, this \"carpet\" can be ordered directly from the supplier as a variant part with the new characteristic pink without entering a new order article.The characteristic bar of a variant part consists of various characteristics or attributes. In our example above, these were the attributes colour and size . The attribute size can also be a formula attribute, i.e. it is calculated from the attributes\"length times width\". In this case, the attributes length and width must be specified in the subpart.The variant part \"carpet\" can of course be specified more precisely by further attributes. For example, material type (such as wool, plastic, or similar), pile thickness (in mm), pattern, etc. would be possible. One could even go so far as to define all carpets in the world as a sub-part of only one variant part. However, this would require an increase in the number of characteristics to be able to describe each carpet in a sufficiently distinguishable way from the others.To what extent parts are described with different variant parts - or whether variant parts are used at all - depends very much on the individual case. A DIY store may have only a few (or even only one) \"carpet\" variants, whereas a carpet manufacturer will prefer a more structured structure of its \"carpet\" variants.",

If several parts with the entered number exist, the selection window with these parts is displayed. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". In the menu under \"Edit -> Variants -> Filter part number\" you can set which part type can be searched for in the field number. When you create a new part, you should first determine whether it is a single part, a variant part or a subpart (Edit -> Variant part -> Part type). The part number for single and variant parts should be unique. When creating a sub-part, the 'Variant part' field appears to select the variant part to which the sub-part is to be assigned. Then assign a part number that makes sense to fit into the part master. Subparts can be created very easily by first calling up its variant part and then pressing the 'Insert' button in the list of subparts. A subpart is then automatically created, linked to the previously called variant and you only have to maintain the specific attributes / characteristics of the part. Existing subparts can be copied by right-clicking on the subpart to be copied in the subpart list of the variant part and selecting \"Copy\". All part data is copied to the new part, including all characteristic settings as well as MRP and stock account settings. Part roles and provision data on the logistics account are not copied. You can create a new part role by calling up the corresponding menu item in the \"Edit\" menu. If the part role has already been defined, it is indicated by a button in the toolbar. You can change the stock data of the part with the button or the menu item \"Stock account\" to view and change it. With a tick in front of Spare part or QA part you can declare the new part as a spare part or provide it for QA inspection. In the lower section of the window, under Characteristics, you can insert or delete characteristics. Save your data with OK. You can use the validity to exclude individual parts that are no longer to be used from the current part master. It should be noted that this also has an influence on parts lists and stock levels. Invalid parts can lead to error messages if they have not been replaced. To be able to edit existing parts, select the corresponding part via the selection window by double-clicking on it. Via 'Edit' you can change search terms, insert and create characteristics, jump to the warehouse account, the purchasing data, etc. and edit them. Since non-controlling attributes can be assigned to each subpart, they appear grey in the list. The column headings of these attributes change depending on which subpart you have selected. Controlling attributes are shown in turquoise. Subparts can be decoupled from the variant part and then treated as individual parts in the system. This way, the part could then be declared invalid, for example. A picture can be stored for a part in the \"Picture\" tab. This is then saved in the database.

At the moment, customer orders, stock orders and advance requirements cannot be planned together. For example, several sales order items or stock order items may be combined, but not, for example, a sales order item and a preliminary requirements item. Although the actual further processing of the gozintograph generated in this way takes place in the\"Parts request\" module, optional specifications for the automated further processing of the gozintograph can already be made in this parts scheduling module: Automatic determination of the disposition type, the procurement time and execution of a first parts scheduling as forward or backward scheduling.

        "input": "The constantly changing requirements in the markets lead to a constant adaptation and expansion of the own product range (external variance). In addition, the company's own engineering and production also contributes to changes in the parts used (internal variance). This external and internal variance often leads to a constant growth of the own parts base and can lead to increasing difficulties to configure the own products customer-specific and error-free.Carefully constructed parts classes or other ontologies can help to keep an overview and order in the parts master, but they usually cannot prevent the parts master from growing per se. Also missing is the definition of a configuration logic for the own products.By introducing sustainable variant management, the growth of the parts master can be slowed down sustainably, which automatically leads to an increased overview, improved order in the parts master and overall to improved efficiency in the production process. On the other hand, the necessary configuration logic for one's own product range results almost in parallel.For this purpose, it is first necessary to find \"similar\" parts in the part master, i.e. to find and structure groups of parts in such a way that the individual members of a group can only be unambiguously described by different versions of one and the same set of characteristics. The attribute scale itself is determined by the group and is therefore valid for all members (parts) of the group.For each group of parts, a so-called variant part with its specific characteristics is then created. The parts of the group are then assigned to the variant part as so-called sub-parts, whereby the characteristics list is defined for each of these sub-parts according to the characteristics of the sub-part. The sub-parts assigned to a variant part clearly show the differences between these sub-parts with regard to the characteristic values of the features.Here it can often already be established that sub-parts have been defined unnecessarily, since their characteristics - clearly described by the characteristic bar - are quite comparable and even substitutable with other sub-parts of the same variant part.The consistent introduction of product features, product feature strips and variant parts gives the entire parts master a clear structure. The focus is no longer on the individual parts, but rather on material features, i.e. characteristics that determine the parts to be used. The rules of configuration logic then only refer to characteristics - i.e. properties - and no longer directly to part numbers.This separation of the configuration logic from part numbers also makes it possible to determine configurations with parts for which there is still \"no part number\": in this case, the configuration determines variant parts with those characteristics for which there is (still) no subpart in the variant part. This does not have to be the case, because the desired - non-existent - part is clearly specified by the variant part and the distinct attribute list. With this unambiguous specification, it can be processed throughout the entire logistics process even without a system in the part master.Variant parts and their associated lower parts with a distinct list of characteristics can thus help to increase the diversity of the product range without creating an overflowing parts master: in this way, variance can be controlled.",

        "input": "Important! Please also read the description on the subject of location-specific data in the installation documentation This module is used to create, maintain and manage location-specific data. These can represent and explain federal states, provinces and any deeply nested regions. When a user logs on to the system, the system checks whether a separate company calendar (locale) exists at the employing company (place of employment of the employee). If so, this locale calendar is logged on, otherwise it is checked whether the locale has one and so on up to the top locale. If no company calendar was found in this way, the system checks whether there is a locale at the client company and registers it. If no locale is linked here either, the locale specified in the batch file via the environment variables for country, state and region is registered. As the ClassiX® system knows the connections between different localities, for example the superordinate country of any state or region, the following possibilities arise: Generally speaking, a country's characteristics are handed down to a federal state and then to subordinate regions. However, some of this information can be overwritten by directly changing a certain property in a subordinate locality, for example a federal state. Now this new property applies to this subordinate locality and all its subordinate localities, for example regions. Of course you can also change the same property in some of the subordinate localities, for example in regions. However, a region can also pass on properties to a federal state and this to the higher-level state. This is the special case where a superior locality has at least all time zones of its subordinate localities. Of course, the time zones of the superior locality can be extended, but not restricted. This is another reason why you need to be sure where you are making settings. That is why the characteristics of a locality are divided into informative characteristics of the superior country, characteristics to be set in the superior country and characteristics to be set in this locality: Informative characteristics of a country are: - Country name - Country code - Number plate - Winter/summer time or summer/winter time changeover These properties are taken from internal tables and cannot be changed by the user to ensure consistency with reality. These informative properties are valid for the country and all its subordinate localities. The characteristics of a country to be set are: - National currency - International area code - Number format - Date and time These characteristics are from a superior country, not from a subordinate locality, and must therefore be changed at the state level. These properties to be set are valid for the country and all its subordinate localities. The properties of a locality to be set are: - Place name - Language - System number of the language - Time zone or start and end time zone (regions have only one time zone) - Working days - Telecommunications - Holidays and holidays These properties are specific to a particular location and can therefore be set at all levels. If these properties are only set at state level, they are also valid for all subordinate localities. However, as mentioned above, these can be changed at a subordinate local level. These changes are valid for the edited locality and all its subordinate localities. Telecommunication is an exception, as these settings are only valid for your own locality, neither taken from above nor transferred to below. A special case of informative features are the federal state and region codes. These are automatically assigned by the ClassiX® system when the corresponding localities are created and can be used in combination with the state codes to set the environment variables in the project-specific batch file. You can read more about this in the description of location-specific data in the installation documentation. Attention! If you make changes to the location that is currently set as the system location, you must first activate it by setting this location as the system location again.",

If an order was scheduled for 6.2.2012 and has a purchase order with the same date, but today is 7.2.2012 and the purchase order has not yet arrived, then the order is classified as a missing part and receives the shortage indicator in the MRP account.

In order to be able to describe the dynamically created objects, their attributes and relationships, an ObjectCrawler is implemented with this module, which independently scans the database, collects, examines and categorises objects and stores this information as meta-description. These meta descriptions of the objects and their attributes and relationships can then be maintained here. Before starting the search, you must define the settings for the search, on which the speed and duration of the search depend. The following settings are available: Under the boundary conditions you can specify the maximum age of the meta-info. To speed up the search, meta-information is not overwritten and skipped if it is younger than the set date. Transaction splitting is used to specify after how many transactions (analyses of meta objects) the results are saved in the database. The maximum collection depth specifies how many elements of an M1, MN relation, or collection are analysed (if set to 0, all elements of a collection are searched). The maximum collection depth can significantly influence the duration of the crawling process, a value of 500, and 5 for very large databases, can lead to fast results. Equally important for the duration of the crawling process is the recursion depth parameter (-1 stands for infinite depth). The recursion depth determines how far the crawler should recursively examine the references of an object. Regardless of this setting, the ObjectCrawler always performs a width search, i.e. referenced objects are only examined after all siblings of an object have been examined. The last and most important option is the REP start index, which tells where the object crawler is located when searching the database. The crawler searches the database in such a way that it takes a single object from each REP and examines it to get a clear and meaningful picture of the database as quickly as possible. This so-called REP start index determines the current (start) index of this object extraction from the REPs. -1 lets the crawler take a random element from each REP, but if you want to do a full scan, you should start at 0 and observe the increment of this value to know where the crawler is at that moment. If this value exceeds the maximum length of a REP, the crawler is automatically stopped and you have thus scanned the entire REP. Under the runtime options you can limit the crawling duration of the object crawler. By default you let the crawler run until you stop it (the cancel button in the progressbar window closes the search with EndTXN and therefore the button is more a stop button than a cancel button) or until it is finished. You can stop the crawler automatically after the first run by selecting the option with the same name or only when the queue with all REP objects from the first run including their referenced objects is processed and empty by selecting the corresponding option Stop crawler when queue is empty. Depending on the selected option, you can control the behaviour in case of errors. In this sense, errors are not InstantView errors but logical consistency errors in the database. It is recommended to select the option Log error and continue. Under other settings you can define various options like: ObjectCrawler logging: all ObjectCrawler operations are written to separate log files. Process backreferences intelligently: if this option is selected, certain class checks are performed when examining backreferences to prevent errors.",

Similarly, a list of objects can be selected in this module from which data can be output (FROM \"REP collection\"). The objects of such a list belong to a certain class or a class inherited from this class.

Due to the use of an object-oriented database, the selected data fields - nested within themselves - can be references (POINTER or REL_1M) to other objects. This module supports the construction of such data access paths by simple navigation to the referenced classes, such as reference_to_object_1.reference_to_object_2.reference_to_object_3.target_data_field_in_object_3 (the individual references are connected with \".\" each other). Since such access paths can also contain function or method calls, the classes also output their methods. Once you have selected your (\"SELECT\") data fields, you can further specify the selection of data to be displayed by a (\"WHERE\") specification, which must be specified here in the form of a query expression or InstantView® script.

        "input": "Advance requirements are used to cover real requirements that are generated at a later date. This is useful for parts with long replenishment lead times (planned delivery time or in-house production time). For this reason, preliminary requirements make no sense for e.g. level 0 parts within a sales order. You can create the corresponding order item directly and do not have to take the diversion via advance requirements. Therefore, preliminary requirements should only be created for MRP sub-items of a production BOM that has not yet been exploded and technically released as a whole, if the time between technical release and the required procurement date is shorter than the expected delivery time. However, the same can also apply to sub-items kept in stock, which have a very low minimum stock level, show high consumption and also have a relatively long delivery time. There you can use the advance requirements to reserve a certain number of parts in the warehouse before the actual disposition of the finally exploded parts list. The system only makes sense if the planned part is actually scheduled at a later point in time, i.e. can be offset. It therefore makes no sense to create an advance requirement for part X, whereby this part always occurs as a component of the higher-level and stock-keeping part Z, and this part Z is also ultimately planned. It makes just as little sense to create an advance requirement for a part that only appears in parts lists as a constructive (fictitious) item and is ultimately never manufactured and is therefore not planned. Advance requirements documents can be created in the course of planning. When creating a preliminary requirement, it is specified for which order and on which date how much goods are expected to be needed. A preliminary requirements document can contain several items. Only one - not completed, openly running - preliminary requirement can be triggered per order for each part. A scheduled advance requirement item (with a staging date) is posted in the MRP account as a requirement trigger (\"future issue\") and therefore leads to an increase in requirements for the corresponding part. The \"aim\" of the document is to reserve or procure the preplanned quantity in advance. Later, the respective advance requirement item is replaced by a \"real\" requirement trigger in the MRP account; this can be an order item or a part requirement item.",

        "input": "2.1 Preset attribute A preset attribute allows a dynamic data field to be given a descriptive name, further explanatory data or a default setting. Example: A carpet seller with a ClassiX® software wants to describe his carpets by different characteristics. For example, all carpets should be described by their price. So he adds a characteristic to all master data, in which he can then specify the price. If individual carpets are to be described by their colour (no free input, only colours from a colour table should be available), he can do this by means of an attribute, which for example describes a data field of type 'String'. This attribute is then provided with a table with the different colours. Attention: Attribute values are only supported in the formulas up to a maximum of 100 characters! 2.2 Formula attributes As the name suggests, formula attributes are used to fill a data field with a formula, or with the value that the formula calculates. Constants can be entered directly into the formula while the variable values are slot attributes. Example: The carpet seller now wants to describe his carpets also by size, whereby the carpets have the characteristic that all carpets have the same width (4m) and differ only in length. Here the carpet seller benefits from the formula attributes. So he creates an attribute with the formula '4m * length'. The length is again a preset attribute, whereby the value or the result of the formula attribute changes automatically when the value is changed. 2.3 Conditional attributes Conditional attributes can contain a table that describes an \"if - then\" relationship. Example: The carpets of the carpet seller are to have their own price per colour. We now create a conditional attribute and fill the table with the data we need for the price calculation. (e.g.: red -> 10 € ; blue -> 20 € ; yellow -> 30€ ) In addition, we set our just created attribute in dependence of the attribute for the colour.(see example Preset attribute) If the attribute for the colour is changed, the corresponding value of the condition table is now automatically returned.",

Now, these goods can no longer be assigned to a particular goods receipt, but it must still be possible to return them to the supplier who most probably delivered this part. This is the function of the complaint document. This can be created directly for a stock removal or optionally also for a quality assurance document that has a stock removal as its predecessor. If the goods are expected back from the supplier, this can be activated with the checkbox \"Goods are expected back\", this complaint behaves like an order. The quantity is displayed in the dispatch account until the complete delivery. It may also be the case that the goods have been ready for some time at the customer and only then the customer discovers that the goods are defective and sends them back. In this case, there is the possibility to search for the original goods withdrawal document on the complaint document using the order number. A link to a goods withdrawal document is always advisable, as this is the only way to ensure that the material flow and cost distribution is 100% correct and remains traceable for later. Since a withdrawal document is not always available, for example in the case of Kanban or manual warehouse parts without warehouse management, it is also possible to attach the complaint document directly to an order header so that the flow of goods can be assigned at least to one order or cost object. The return loop is also fully integrated for this document, i.e. if a goods receipt is not perfect according to this complaint document, it is immediately sent back via a return document. The difference between the return document and the complaint document is The complaint document always refers to a goods removal The return document must refer to a goods receipt as a predecessor. The return document can therefore only be used if the disposition process of the part is not yet completed due to a QA or missing goods putaway or staging. If this process has already been completed, there is still the possibility to send the goods back via the complaint document. Business Process If no quality assurance document has been created for the removal from storage, the quantity made available is deducted from the parts requisition item/order item that may have been placed before the goods are removed. It can now be removed again via the staging list. If the goods receipt now arrives for an item that has already been made available in the meantime by another withdrawal, the status of the goods receipt changes to \"goods putaway\" and must be put away. If the item has not yet been removed again, the goods receipt goes to the status \"Ready\". In the case of partial quantities (requirement has already been partially covered), the goods receipt first goes to the status \"staging\", but after staging its partial quantity it changes to the status \"putaway\" so that the remaining quantity can be put away.

For example, a holder plate that is stamped from a large raw material sheet.This sheet metal plate is not stocked because the remaining surface dimensions in the warehouse cannot be accurately calculated by punching out certain shapes. The remaining quantity of sheet metal plates is estimated for each requirement and either reordered via the order proposal list or simply rejected.

General: Incoming invoice credit notes are recorded and released in an almost identical way to incoming invoices. Thus, the masks for the entry look almost identical, but are still two different ones. However, the masks can be distinguished by the title and by the picture next to the number. The differences to the invoices: The first difference is, of course, that the values, even if they are shown as positive, are recorded negatively in the financial accounts. In the same way as for incoming invoices, \"normal\" and \"free\" items can also be entered for credit notes. The difference, however, is the previous check. Thus, normal items of a credit note can only be entered if the previous order item has the status \"partially invoiced\" or \"invoiced\". These \"normal\" items should be recorded if the credit note is intended to cancel all or part of the invoice or quantity invoiced. If the full invoice quantity is credited, the order item is again in the status \"not invoiced\". The other case is that a rebate/discount is subsequently credited to the invoiced quantity. In this case a credit note is recorded, but this should not have any effect on the calculation status of the order item. This corresponds to the free item, as is already the case with incoming invoices. The following aspects have an influence on the release of a position. Items that do not meet all controls must be checked manually and then released manually. A position must be checked if the position should be examined independently of any problems. the value deviation is too large. different header conditions on order and credit note were determined. it is a free credit item the total quantity of all credit notes relating to an order item is greater than the quantity invoiced. the total quantity of all credit notes relating to an order item differs from the quantity invoiced. it is a free credit item.

These are the bills of materials which are generated by the system by exploding master bills of materials, taking into account the characteristics and their values specified from a customer order, warehouse order or advance requirement. The term \"explosion\" refers to the selection of entries from, for example, variant parts list items or the calculation of quantities and/or characteristic values. As a special feature it should be noted that in the so-called tree view of the parts list, the calculated total quantity is displayed for each parts list entry, although only individual quantities are entered. If you change a quantity on any level in the parts list, all quantities on the levels below are automatically updated, i.e. multiplied out and the required total quantities are displayed. Normally, ClassiX® assumes that at least a \"rough\" variant bill of material is defined for each part in the system. This avoids having to define and enter a separate master bill of material for each special case in advance. Within the scope of technical processing and design, this order-specific exploded production bill of materials is then adapted or designed more precisely with regard to parts, characteristic values and quantities. The changes are then only valid for the respective order item. To quickly create new parts lists, it is possible to drag a part from the parts master into the production parts list structure using the mouse. This way only the quantity needs to be adjusted and if necessary the new item needs to be exploded (if it is an assembly - red gear symbol!). In principle, however, it is also possible to completely redefine the order-specific production parts list. Note: If, for example, within an order-specific production bill of materials - which was exploded or generated from a \"standard\" bill of materials - somewhere on a lower structural level, one part is exchanged for another part, then this production bill of materials no longer \"matches\" the original \"standard\" bill of materials. Basically, this is then also a completely new assembly, in general terms, all higher-level parts have been redefined as a result - although they still have their original part number in this production bill of materials. This procedure should therefore only be used in order to be able to quickly and pragmatically comply with any customer request for (simple) \"exotic\" parts (e.g. exchanging the screws for other screw heads). As the production parts lists are retained in the system, it is always possible to trace what has been installed where: However, the order itself must always be queried in the system. It is therefore recommended to make changes to production BOMs only for variant parts (the \"uniqueness\" of the BOM is anyway only ensured by the characteristic values defined in the order) and possibly to mark a characteristic of such parts with a version. Attention: Due to changes in the production bill of materials, it can happen that the routing of the parent part no longer matches the current production bill of materials. In order to be able to find out these items, there is an item\"Display number of entries (production bill of material/master bill of material)\" in the view options in the menu \"Edit\". If this option is set, information is displayed after each line in the production parts list tree: (x/x). The front x represents the number of parts list entries of the exploded production parts list below this entry. The back x represents the number of parts list entries of the master parts list of this entry.

A combination of attribute values is invalid according to the restriction table if it returns \"Not allowed\" as a result. Therefore it is also valid if it does not return a result. Warning should be used for values that are still tolerable but the user should have the final decision. As a rule, only the combinations and warnings that are not permitted are stored in the restrictions table. However, if the number of permitted combinations is smaller than the number of non-permitted combinations, the permitted combinations can also be entered.

In the parts master, the assembly set part has a production role without a bill of materials, but with a routing that contains the assembly only the assembly work of the individual components. Subassembly sets can also be used as purchased parts with own provision. If such a subassembly set is available in the order, one practically determines at the order level through sub-items which goods are to be provided for the order and in which quantities.

Characteristics can be assigned to these conditional individual parts, which later appear in the offer or order items. If no characteristics were entered for these conditional individual parts, the quotation or order item automatically takes the characteristics of the selected individual part from the parts master. If conditional items are present in an assembly set, the assembly set in the order is not exploded automatically, but must be exploded using the \"Generate plant components\" button after the attributes on the assembly set order item have been set according to customer specifications (e.g. mains voltage etc.), because this may be the basis for the conditional sub-items of the assembly set.

Although a sales set is a part roll, it is the only part roll that does not need to be related to a part. For example, if the combination of the sales articles - the sales set itself - is stocked, it must be assigned to a part (consisting of the combined parts). For example, a spare parts set would be a sales set consisting of different spare parts. If the spare part sets are pre-packed and stored in the warehouse, then the spare part set has its own part number. The possible packaging (bag, sack, carton) of a sales set can be assigned to the part of the sales set as a parts list, accordingly the compilation of a set can be assigned to the part of the sales set as a routing. A special form of the sales set is the assembly set, whose individual parts are directly processed as a parts list.Conditional individual parts in sets Conditional individual parts can be included in sets. Characteristics can be assigned to these conditional individual parts, which later appear in the offer or order items. If no characteristics were entered for these conditional individual parts, the quotation or order item automatically takes the characteristics of the selected individual part from the parts master.Characteristics of the lower partsWhen sub-parts are added to sets, all characteristics of the selected part are copied from the part master into the characteristics of the new sub-position of the set. These can now be set as desired and are then valid for all quotation/order items created from this set, if the characteristics have not been explicitly defined and thus overwritten.Calculation and quantity calculation for main and sub-items Five types (types) are distinguished as to how sub-items are assembled with the main item (see the field \"Type\", which is displayed on the first tab \"Quotation/Order item\" if a main item has been loaded); besides the definition of pricing rules and quantity calculation, the control of the business processes disposition, delivery and invoicing are determined according to the type.Description: (see order item).",

Such service call objects can be created e.g. directly from an industrial plant - this should be the origin of the customer's problem - whereby the customer, the plant and the plant group are automatically taken over. The core functionality of this module is that for each service call the employee who is to take care of the service call can be directly assigned. For this purpose, the employee can be assigned his capacity by first selecting the employee concerned via the employee list and then opening the capacity planning via the menu item \"Edit->Set->Capacity planning\". The service call also has an automatic planning function: the determination button on the position can determine an employee who can be deployed or a free period of time based on the data entered so far on the position. On the one hand, it is possible to specify a working group (field Provider) and a planning date with duration on the position. The button then determines the first member of the working group who has the specified capacity (duration) at the specified time. If no working group is specified, all employees of the employee master data are searched. On the other hand, the planning date can also be determined if this is emptied and then an employee is selected. The button then determines when the employee has the planned duration of capacity available and enters the date automatically. If no freelancer or free capacity is found, the mask will not be filled in. Step 1: Setting the employee capacity The system now knows how much working time can be planned for this employee. Step 2: Planning of requirements Via the editing mask of the industrial plants, in the tab \"Plant groups\", a plant group can now be selected and on it the menu item \"Create service call\" can be chosen. A new document, the service call, is created. The plant group and the customer from the industrial plant are immediately transferred to it. In the new mask, the description of what the service call was about can now be entered, for example the error description that the customer gave over the phone. At this point, neither an offer nor an order has been created. After entering the description, the document is first saved by pressing the \"OK\" button. As soon as it is now clear that the service call is to be carried out and bindingly scheduled, sub-items can be inserted on which the date (planned date), the planned duration and an employee must be specified. A new project and a new order is created in the background with a plant group and a service provider group. The service provider group is displayed as a sub-item of the service call.

If no further restriction of the period is made, all confirmations of this fiscal year are added up. If only one period is selected, then only the confirmations of this period are added up. By selecting the \"to\" period, any period within the fiscal year can be selected. By double-clicking on an entry in the list, the corresponding individual messages can be output (drill down). 1. list type workstations The columns - each as actual and target data - are output for cost centre, production area, work centre and resource. The column\"Actual hours\" shows the sum of all reported actual times of the actual resource of the selected period. The column\"Target hours\" shows the sum of all reported target times of the target resource of the selected period. Per PDC document (YYY) the target set-up time is added to the target time of the work sequence. The column\"Actual hours(completed)\" only shows the actual times of completedwork sequences.

The column\"Target hours(completed - not delimited)\" shows all target times of completedwork sequences, the previous evaluation periods are taken into account. This\"Actual hours(finished - not delimited)\" value is compared with the column\"Target hours(finished - not delimited)\", the sum of the target times of completedwork sequences.

The target hours are always assigned to the first reported actual resource in order to obtain a pure comparison of the target/actual times and not an evaluation of changes of the target to actual resources.

This app is intended as an aid for logistics. Related to this are the apps Parts Usage (intended for use by technology) and Parts Usage (intended for use by service/sales). If you generally want to evaluate the use or non-use of a part in a certain period, you can do this by means of an inspection run.In addition to the output of the list with the parts with consumption in the selected period, the complementary list with the parts without consumption in this period is always output in parallel. The following movements are referred to as part consumption:Goods receipts that have not been put away (MRP goods receipt)Production order items that have not been put away (dispositive production). Outsourcing The parts are selected by means of the part selection window, which opens after pressing the toolbar button or the \"Select parts\" button or simply dragged and dropped into the list. With drag&drop, parts rolls are also accepted.By selecting/restricting the staging types of the parts (MRP parts, stock parts, etc.), you can control which parts consumption (goods receipts, MRP production, stock removals) is taken into account in the evaluation. If, for example, only stock parts are selected (staging types: warehouse management, manual stock, remaining quantity, Kanban, own provision of stock), then the planned parts consumption is not included in the evaluation. As a side effect, the list of \"parts without consumption\" also provides a so-called list of slow-moving items. The total consumption of a part results from the sum of the above movements. The evaluation of the total consumption is done according to the following logic: If an incoming invoice has been issued for these goods in the selected period, the price is taken from this invoice and multiplied by the total sales quantity. If no incoming invoice has been created, the system searches for other documents and uses their price for the calculation. When posting the above-mentioned documents, they are entered in the parts transaction file in relation to goods receipt or production - each subdivided into year and month. The corresponding quantities are registered here. Thus, when creating the parts consumption, only the parts operation files of the individual document types have to be fetched and the quantities compiled from them. An exception to this is the removal from storage. Here the quantities are not collected in the parts procedure folder, but in the warehouse statistics. This can be accessed via the warehouse account of the part. A record is created in the list for each part and for each period with consumption, unless the part does not have an operation folder. (For more on this, see the options window)Parts without consumption are listed in the tab \"Parts without consumption\". A double click opens the stock movement window for the clicked period. Attention! Validity is not taken into account in part consumption, i.e. consumption across exchange objects is not displayed! Attention (only companies with separate client turnover)! If the option \"Split variant parts\" is set via the options window, the split display is incorrectly displayed for clients whose material logistics are not separated according to domains/company codes. The total sum of all variant part characteristics is displayed behind each characteristic of a variant part. This is also not possible to separate subsequently, as the conditions for this are defined solely in the transaction descriptions. (What is consumption of one company, what is consumption of the other?) Attention! If a part is marked as \"constructive assembly\", it is not displayed as \"consumption\"! From the dispo account , the parts consumption statistics can be accessed via the \"Parts consumption\" group. If this way is chosen, the consumption of the last 12 months is displayed in the list, whereby the displayed filter remains on the currently valid period. So if you simply use the \"Create statistics\" icon, only the current month will be displayed. The variant filter possibly transferred via the dispo account must also be taken into account: If the statistics from the MRP account were called up after double-clicking on the MRP list with split variants, the statistics will only display the turnovers of the transferred characteristic.

Within a warehouse, the individual storage locations must also be stored in the system as storage bins. In CyberEnterprise business OS, warehouses and their storage locations are not only textual information but describe accounts with their respective stock values. (see also the processing of a warehouse posting in an OLAP network from accounts).A warehouse can be assigned an administrator, an owner and/or a cost centre. The address of the manager is taken over as the address of the warehouse (as a copy). This address can be overwritten manually. In the 'Control' tab, the type of warehouse can be declared as a consignment warehouse, a customs warehouse or a manual warehouse. Such warehouse types can also be specified in more detail in the form of classification terms (see below). Furthermore, warehouses can be marked as non MRP if the stocks of these warehouses are not to be taken into account in MRP from requirement and stock lists. In addition to these indications, different classification keys can be assigned to a warehouse, e.g. in order to assign the warehouse to a storage type (e.g. in addition or optional to the above mentioned type indications), to a (total) storage area, etc. The classification keys can also be assigned to the storage type (see below). Once assigned, the classification terms can be supplemented with characteristics in order to optimally control warehouse management. In the standard system, the term \"storage type\" is predefined as a classification term for a warehouse with the identifier \"STORAGE_TYPE\". Sub-concepts for freely definable storage types are Block storage, open-air storage, high rack storage, picking warehouse, shelf storage, etc. The storage bins assigned to a warehouse can also be assigned to classification keys (see there classification key \"PICKING_ZONE\" for picking zones or storage areas); it is up to the internal organisation to find an optimal structure of the information for the company. By assigning warehouses to company codes, logistical control (e.g. specification of minimum stock levels) and stock monitoring can be further differentiated. If a company code has been assigned, the\"no disposition\" indicator should also be set. The identification as \"chaotic warehouse\" serves to have the system automatically allocate an empty storage bin when goods are received. In the tab 'Domains' it can be specified whether and to which domains the stock of parts in storage bins of this warehouse should be divided. (Not implemented in the standard system).",

Objects of the classes CX_FORMULA and CX_CONDITIONED_BAG can use the function GetInputVarNames() to determine the variables on which their calculated value depends. In case of a formula in the formula (or a condition table: CX_CONDITIONED_BAG) this function calls itself recursively. The module Test formula constructs an input window with this information, with which formulas/condition tables can be tested. The variables are not known a priori - and this also applies to their type, which determines which window object is suitable as input field. InstantView® provides an object Auto, which transforms itself with each FillWindow instruction into a surface object matching the data type.

Finally, the GetPosition/Move pair moves the result line to the position below the last input field. Here an instance of the class CX_CONTAINER is used as an object for the input data - an object whose only function is to hold dynamic data fields.

In addition to a user's login information, such as ID and password, access rights can also be defined here.As a rule, it is the \"own\" employees of the clients defined in the system who are users. Being a user therefore means that a person - in addition to his or her role as an employee - has the additional role of user. The registration of a user is therefore in the true sense the registration of a user role.This also makes it possible to assign user roles to contact persons of other companies. Unlike employees, contact persons of other companies do not have an employee role as an employee of a \"system client\", but a contact person role as an employee of another company. This means that these persons can also be given another role as a user of their system. (e.g. their tax advisors or auditors - but also temporary agency workers - who continue to be and remain the contact person of the external company).If such \"external\" users also carry out activities in which, for example, documents are created with input/output of contact data, it makes sense to store this contact data (e-mail, telephone extension number) - purely in the role as user - directly at the user role. Otherwise, there is a risk that the system will take over the contact data of the \"foreign\" contact person role when printing a document or sending an e-mail.Even if, for example, the employees in the sales department are only to be contacted via a collective e-mail (e.g. sales@myCompany.com), this collective e-mail can be stored for each of these users in their user role. In the employee role itself, the actual contact data for internal company traffic can then remain unchanged and unmistakable.In addition to the user role-specific contact data, a user can also be assigned his or her own first place of work.In addition to user roles that can be assigned to a natural person, one occasionally needs user roles that cannot be permanently assigned to a specific person. This is the case, for example, if the system is to be used by \"third parties\", e.g. for anonymous use via an interface (API). For such cases, user roles can also be assigned to companies (legal persons). Whether the assignment is made to one's own company (e.g. for night runs) or to a third-party company (e.g. the operator of the online shop that transmits data) is not relevant here.In principle, it is also possible to create user roles without any assignment to a natural or legal person.

Entries with a control key are assigned to the fields in the form of the advance return for turnover tax according to the specifications made on the control key.

Setting up the control keys with assignment to the form fields Assignment of such G/L accounts to form fields that could possibly be posted to without a tax key: as a rule, all accounts whose values must be included as the tax base in the advance return for sales tax.

However, you must be aware that all postings to an account marked in this way, which were posted without a tax key, will then always be assigned to this form field.
