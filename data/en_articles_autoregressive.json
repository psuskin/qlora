All logistical and MRP movements and quantities by company code are recorded separately in sub-monitors. It is therefore possible to view the entire process per company code. A company code can be attached to any business object such as a warehouse or a cost centre. When a document is posted, the system determines whether a company code must be used for posting. If this is the case, the company code is posted separately in addition to the global posting. The company code, which can be created via the master data, must be assigned to an object (warehouse) for which it is to apply. Usually these are warehouses that are to be managed via a separate company code, perhaps independently of the actual warehouse/stock. On the company code, it is possible to specify whether the stock quantity or the requirements should appear in the total account of the part or not (joint or separate parts disposition - requirements stock lists).

By means of a filter, the user can choose whether he wants to see a usage of the part in order-specific production parts lists or in master parts lists. A further option is the display of a usage in sales parts lists. This includes the use of sales articles, spare parts or service units as individual parts in sales sets (not to be confused with the sales set role of a part). This module is intended as a technical aid. Related to this are the modules parts consumption (intended for use by logistics) and parts use (intended for use by service/sales). If you generally want to evaluate the use or non-use of a part in a certain period, you can do this by means of an inspection run. Validity and exchange objects It is also possible to indicate the use of the exchange objects for parts that become invalid and have one or more exchange objects. If the checkbox \"Also consider exchange objects\" is checked, every use of each exchange object is automatically displayed. By simple selection in the list of exchange objects it is possible to display the uses of individual exchange objects. A multiple selection is possible. If all objects are to be displayed again, either select all exchange objects or check the box \"Also consider exchange objects\". All entries will then lose their selections and all objects will be displayed. Use of parts with exchange object: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"358\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} The parts list item points to part AS, which was valid until 29.11.2020. This part will be replaced by part AS2 from 30.11.2020. However, part AS2 itself has no connection to the BOM item, so that no entries would be displayed in the part usage without exchange objects. In order to be able to display the parts list nevertheless, the possibility was created to display the parts usage of the exchange objects in the parts usage (arrow from part AS2 to parts usage of part AS). {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"360\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} In the parts usage, all exchange objects are listed in a list. By ticking the standard checkbox \"Also consider exchange objects\", the part usages of all exchange objects visible in this list are also displayed. The exchange objects in the list can also be selected individually; only the part uses for the selected objects are then displayed. List window: When the display window is called up for the first time, the filter \"Production master data\" is set as standard. A double click on an entry in the list shows the occurrence(s) of the part in BOM items: if a part is used from several master BOM items, a list of these BOM items is displayed.

The context menu for navigating can be called up from a list entry using the right mouse button: here too, the occurrence of the part in parts lists (analogous to double-clicking, see above) or the corresponding user of the parts list, i.e. the production role of a part, can be reached.

If one entry of these 3 grouping lists is marked, all recorded PDC logoffs corresponding to this grouping appear in the lower list. The call is made by selecting the evaluation period(s). It is also possible to select one or more orders via the toolbar or by drag and drop and to evaluate the corresponding PDC hours. The module can only be called up if financial years and periods are defined in the system. List window: The first thing to do is to select the desired evaluation period(s). Then press the button (\"Run statistics\") starts the evaluation for all resources in the selected period. By means of the context menu (right mouse button) in the list windows or by drag and drop the selection can be further selected to orders, cost centres, workstations, work groups and work areas. The list is recreated directly after the selection. Result:: As a result, the lists within the tabs on the mask below the evaluation periods are filled. Here are statistical subtotals which, depending on the tab, contain either reasons for deviation, resource or cost centre evaluations. The deviations are always shown in 3 columns: 1. hours in format SS:MM 2. minutes 3. percent Minutes has been added to the list so that you can also sort by them. Sorting according to the hour display is not possible, because it is a plain text field and in this case 21 would come before 3, because sorting starts with the first character from the left - as usual with alphabetical text sorting. If an entry of these lists is marked, all associated SFDC data acquisition will appear in the lower list. A multiple selection is also possible. If a PDC recording has a supplementary comment on the overtime or undertime, this can be viewed in its completeness by clicking on the toolbar button \" \" can be viewed and changed. A double click opens the editing mask of the PDC document. The target time in the lower list results from the following calculation: Logged off quantity * piece time + set-up time. So if only one of 10 pieces is logged off, the SET time is not displayed for the full 10 pieces. Example: Work sequence 010 has 10 hose connections, a piece time of 10 minutes and a set-up time of 5 minutes. If 2 pieces are now logged off, this results in a SET time of 25 minutes (2*10 minutes + 5 minutes set-up time). Option window: In the option window the BDE notes to be evaluated can be limited and filtered. The limitation can be specified for excess and shortfall quantities for BDE notes with and without deviation reason. This is very practical, as you can set that you are already interested in the receipts with a deviation of + 10% working time, but only those that were not justified. The receipts with reasons are only interesting from a deviation of e.g. 100%. You can also filter the negative deviation separately for all cases. Documents which have SOLL=ACTUAL can be ignored by unchecking the box \"Display documents without deviation\". However, this function is only available if no other filter is set, since then the documents without deviation are below the set limit anyway. Technical documentation: The evaluation is still done by collecting the information. However, it will be converted to automatic posting. Module name: analypdc.mod. Classes: -."

        "output": "Application Calendar: For tasks that are to be executed automatically in the background at certain times or that would place too heavy a load on the DP system during operation, there is the option of moving evaluation, closing and printing tasks to an application calendar. The tasks are then not executed directly, but scheduled for an automatic ClassiX service (server).Such tasks to be executed automatically are managed by means of so-called application calendars (entries). There are basically three different types of application calendars:Recurring tasksInterval tasksOne-off tasksRecurring tasks A task is called \"recurring\" if the smallest unit for repeating the task is \"one day\". These are so-called night runs, which are started daily by the system administration. To set up such a \"night run\" server, a ClassiX start file (e.g. as App Suite (*.cxp) or directly the app applicationScheduleExceute.app) must be executed on a client via batch file, which checks and processes all pending tasks at a certain time (e.g. every night as a cron service of the operating system).An example of an evaluation shifted to the night is the post-calculation of customer orders (this is a so-called system application). In the case of very large and complex orders, the ongoing post-calculation during daytime operations can cause considerable database blockages and waiting times. Such a post-run is activated in the client. Users also have the option of scheduling very extensive evaluations so that these can be found in their saved lists the next morning or these saved lists can be printed out during the night directly on the user's standard printer (these are so-called user applications). Each user can also schedule each evaluation several times with different settings. For each user, a separate user group is created with his specific settings and assigned to the respective user application. Examples of user applications: supply chain management Supplier declaration Only user applications have subordinate user groups with the execution steps they contain. System applications directly contain the execution steps. Once all these recurring tasks have been processed, the service terminates atomatically.Interval tasks If tasks are defined with an \"interval\", the call is not automatically terminated after all open tasks have been completed and the system repeatedly executes the various tasks at the respective defined intervals. \"Interval\" tasks are checked every 5 minutes (adjustable with environment variable CX_APP_SCHEDULE_SNIFFER_INTERVAL). Tasks can also be defined.One-off tasks If tasks are neither defined as \"Recurring\" nor with an \"Interval\", they are considered \"one-off\" tasks and are also only executed once. Such one-off tasks are also processed in the so-called night runs. Input window: This app is used to maintain application calendar (entries). List: This app is used to list all application calendar (entries). Position window: This app is used to edit an application calendar (entry), whether group or individual execution. Execution: There is a central app (applicationScheduleExecute.app) with which all pending application calendars are executed. This app can either be started directly (e.g. for night runs) or included in an app suite using the message EXECUTE_APPLICATION_SCHEDULE. Here, a separate time trigger is set for each interval application calendar (see applicationScheduleTriggeredStart.app), all other recurring or one-time application calendars are also executed. If new application calendars are constantly coming into the system (e.g. through an API), you can start an application calendar sniffer (see cxApplicationSchedule::StartApplicationScheduleSniffer), which searches for new application calendars at specified time intervals and executes them if it is their turn. If a task has been executed, either the task itself or, in the case of repeatable or system tasks, a copy of it is moved to the applications log. If warning or error messages occur during the execution of a task, they are suppressed and written to files separated by month in the directory .\\System\\SystemOut\\AppScheduleLog\\YYYY-MM\\xxxx.log. However, other tasks that have not yet been executed will continue to be executed. Scalability of night runs As there is usually only a short time window available for night runs, it is possible to start several night run instances and assign them to a category. The individual night runs then only perform the tasks that are assigned to their category. Here a main instance, e.g. category A, should be defined, which is then executed shortly before the other instances, so that it can complete leading system tasks (start statistical periods, import latest currency table), which the other instances will use later. A category can therefore be assigned to each application. In addition, each application can be given a code number for the sequence. When the night runs are executed, all applications are sorted in ascending order. Thus, the task with the highest priority has the lowest number. The category of the instance is assigned using the environment variable CX_BATCH_ID. This can be set before calling the system with the command \"SET CX_BATCH_ID=A\" or via the system environment variables!. Pending application calendar entries: This app is used to list the application calendar entries to be executed in the near future. Here, for example, you can check what will be started today. The dates of recurring applications are also calculated and taken into account. The user can be set as a filter. Only users for whom due applications are scheduled are displayed in the user list. If no user is registered, the pending tasks of all users are displayed. Using the date field, the due date can also be checked for a date in the future. web service: Application calendars can also be started with the POST message EXECUTE_APPLICATION_SCHEDULE?USERID=myUserID&PASSWORD=myPassword&BATCHID=A via a web service.

This conditional table determines the possible values (characteristics) of the attribute. The conditional table is only evaluated at the time of the conditional attribute query. Only then the entries (conditions) of the table are calculated. As with the evaluation of each condition (=formula) in ClassiX®, it may happen that the conditions contain variables that are not automatically found by the system. Therefore, when creating these conditions (table entries), you should make sure that the conditional attribute is later used in a context in which the conditions can be evaluated. Or in the conditional attribute the flag \"ignore non-determinable/calculable condition\" is set, i.e. such conditions are simply ignored. The conditional table can be tested directly in the input window, the required variables are then interactively queried by the system. (see menu item \"Test conditional attribute\" or corresponding button) For general information on processing conditional tables, please refer to Tables.

Only the results must be edited manually. Conditions can also be taken from another conditional attribute. To do this you have to open the attribute from which you want to copy the conditions, call the copy buffer and move the desired conditions into the copy buffer. In the attribute to be extended the conditions can now be dropped into the table. New table entries are then created with the dropped conditions and an empty result. The result type results from the type of the conditioned attribute and possibly the result type of the first table entry, if it exists. You can find more information in the topic Features. Attention: Attribute values are only supported in the formulas up to a maximum of 100 characters!. Nested conditions: ClassiX® offers the possibility to nest conditions, i.e. to create the condition within the condition. This is not necessary, but it can make the maintenance of attributes clearer and thus more secure, as not all possible combinations have to be maintained in one single table.

This is particularly useful in product configuration (the specification of variant parts), but can also be useful when entering any form (document) or master data. Application example for the gradual development: An application example for the gradual development of attributes is the division of a complex table of values of an attribute. Let us assume there is an attribute \"MATERIAL\". Behind this attribute there is a very large selection of different materials (various types of steel, aluminium and plastic as well as numerous alloys). This table can become very long, so it could take longer to select the right material. As a solution to this problem, the attribute \"MATERIAL\" can be created several times and the result table can be restricted in each case. So mine could create an attribute for steel, aluminium etc. and offer only the corresponding selection options as a result table. In addition you would have to create a new attribute \"MATERIAL_ART\" with the selection table: steel, aluminium, plastic and alloys. Behind this attribute, an attribute node is stored, which refers to the corresponding attribute \"MATERIAL\" depending on the set value. For example, in the sales item, the attribute \"MATERIAL_ART\" is then inserted instead of the complex table \"MATERIAL\". In the order, one then first selects \"MATERIAL_ART\". The corresponding attribute \"MATERIAL\" is then automatically added and in the second stage this value can then be set. Application example for the conditional gradual characteristic: The conditional characteristic behaves similarly to the application example mentioned above, but is a little more complex. In the first example, the expression of one attribute led to other attributes with the same name with filtered result tables. However, an extensive product configuration can also be carried out via the attribute nodes. Let us imagine the configuration of a car. A car can be defined by many parameters. However, these parameters can be strongly interdependent. For example, after selecting 2- or 4-door, the question of rear electric windows may be obsolete. The same applies if one of the parameters is selected as the series and various extras are then already included.

        "output": "Demand and stock list: The demand/inventory list (short: B&B list) offers two modes/options of demand/inventory evaluation: 1. during the date control, requirement coverage documents (planned goods receipts) are analysed with regard to their existence and the replenishment time of the part. Thus, it can be checked whether the stock becomes negative at all or within the respective replenishment time. In such a case, requirement requests for purchased parts or stock orders for production parts can be generated directly from the list. 2. inventory control involves analysing the stocks available today (total stock of a part as of today) and the balance of future movements (balance of all stock reservations, orders, production orders, etc.) This analysis is supported by rules (formulas). These rules include evaluations for e.g. lists of slow-moving items, test runs for parts with negative stock, negative order or production quantity and, of course, balanced minimum stock underruns. This evaluation is available in a time-aggregated form as a requirements/stock overview . The requirements and stock list can also be called up for individual company codes. Schedule control: Mode in which the possible minimum stock underrun is displayed and explained for each part. The corresponding cover documents, which are used to restore the stock level, are also analysed here in relation to the planned dates. Compile a list: a) Mark the field \"Date control\" (this resets formula windows). b) Make a selection in the Date check field (\"strict\", \"medium\" or \"soft\", see also MRP account) As the planned date (\"per date\") can also be specified as a time span, this specification determines where these dates can move within the time span. (see QM tests) {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"362\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} In the case of requirements from part requirements (departure date), the planned date is made up of the earliest and latest start, which also results in a time span. With the evaluation type \"Strict\", the earliest date of this time span is always used for the evaluation, with the setting \"Medium\" exactly the middle and with \"Soft\" the end of the time span, i.e. there is the least buffer for the real demand. If planning (e.g. stock replenishment) is to be carried out with a certain buffer time, the setting \"Medium\" is recommended, which is also set in this way in the standard system. If there is little space in the warehouse or if the warehouse budget is to be kept as low as possible, the setting \"Soft\" is recommended, whereby planning is always carried out on the actual demand date. \"Strict\" thus means that the goods are always procured at the earliest possible date and may also lie in the warehouse for some time until they are needed, depending on how large the buffer times of the requirements were. c) Select stock underruns This indicates which underruns one would like to have listed. You can select underruns of the stock level (Neg.), small minimum stock (Min.), small reorder level (Meld.) and larger maximum stock (Max.). For example, you can ignore negative underruns in order to analyse only the underruns of the minimum and reorder levels. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"364\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} When checking the minimum stock level and the reorder level, the current stock plus an order item is taken into account which is in the first position of the planning and is to be delivered within the replenishment lead time. d) Define the underrun type of the above underrun: The first underrun of one of the previously selected underrun types is output immediately or only the \"most serious\" underrun is returned. The sequence of the check is as follows: less than zero, less than minimum stock, less than reorder point, greater than maximum stock. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"366\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} If Selection is set to \"First shortfall\" and the first thing to do is to fall below the reorder point or fall below it, possible negative stocks are not taken into account. In the other case (\"most serious undercut\"), on the other hand, this negative stock level and the following cover note are analysed. e) Define period preview (factor replenishment time): An empty field at\"replenishment time x\" displays all shortfalls of the above selected stocks. If you only want to see the underruns within the \"simple\" replenishment lead time of the respective part, enter a 1 in this field. For double time enter 2, etc. The basis for the check is always today's date, which is added for the preview with the replenishment lead time multiplied by the factor specified here. Example: f) Select parts (see above). Since the B&B list in the actual sense refers to the availability of the stocked parts, one should also make the appropriate selection here. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"368\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Alternatively, it is also possible to drop parts and structures into the list window and thus start the stock control. When dropping a structure, all parts below the structure node are transferred to the B&B list, no matter in which sublevel they are located. You can select the parts to be ordered in the list and generate a requirement request (stock requirement) with the requirement quantities, which you can then still change (\"Enter new requirement request\" and \"Extend requirement request\" buttons). You can also create stock orders for production parts from the list. Stock control: For each part, MRP and stock balances are displayed and the total available quantity is calculated (available quantity today = stock on hand, total available quantity = stock after total MRP = closing balance in the MRP account). Compile a list: a) Select formula via the filter: select one of the requirement formulas defined in the master data(master formulas whose name begins with \"DEMAND_\") or manually enter any formula expression in the \"Formula\" field. Then only the parts for which the formula result is \"True\" (1) will be displayed in the list. When changing the formula later, the quantity of parts to be checked remains the same, i.e. all parts that corresponded to the part search in a previous run are taken into account again. b) Select parts: Press the search button and make a selection; then the stock control is carried out for the parts selected in this way. If parts have already been displayed, the list is deleted first. The selection of parts can be limited as much as possible by using the corresponding window. Alternatively, it is also possible to drop parts and structures into the list window and thus start the stock check. When dropping a structure, all parts below the structure node are transferred to the B&B list, no matter in which sublevel they are located. Calculation of the available quantity: Calculation of the required quantity: You can select the parts to be ordered in the list and generate a requirement request (stock requirement) with the requirement quantities, which you can then still change (\"Enter new requirement request\" and \"Extend requirement request\" buttons). You can also create stock orders for production parts from the list. Create purchase orders from the B&B list:: If one or more items are marked in the list and the button \"Create new order\" is pressed, these marked items will be sorted by the main suppliers of the parts. So the main supplier (A-supplier) of the part is used for the price determination of the parts. If no supplier has been entered for a part, the price defined by default in the order item role is used. For more information on pricing, see here. In the parts list, new columns \"U-type/quantity\", \"U-date/document\" and \"U-order\" are displayed with the following information:. Create requisition from stock/requirements list.: You can generate a requirement coverage request directly from the stock/requirements list by selecting the relevant lines in the list and clicking on 'Create new requirement coverage request'. The window of the last requirement request item opens automatically. In the window 'Requirement request' all marked items are listed. You can add further items from the stock/requirements list via 'Extend requirement coverage request'. Once you have finished your entries, you can decide whether or not the requisition must be approved by ticking the box before approval. With 'Book' the requirement request is forwarded. Purchase parts with own provision: No BA can be generated for purchased parts with internal provision, but a stock order must be created: Since for purchased parts with internal provision some parts - defined in the supplier agreement of the ordered part - must be sent to the supplier for the order, a requirement coverage request cannot simply be created for parts that are marked in the logistics account as \"purchased part with internal provision\". A purchase order or production order may first have to be created for the parts to be provided. The purchase order is therefore dependent on the parts to be provided. In order to control this logistical process, a stock order must be created for these parts , from which a parts request is then created. The requirement request for the order part is then created from the part request when the parts are released. Attention: In the logistics account of the purchased part with self-supply, it is defined which possible suppliers there are for this provided part. If more than one is selected, the explosion of the parts list is cancelled at the generated stock order. When creating the parts request, a message appears informing you that the supplier from whom the purchased part is to be purchased with in-house provision must be specified on the exploded production parts list. You will find further information on the subject of supplies on the following pages:. Quality assurance: Check B&B list.doc To test the B&B list, you should prepare a part with the desired settings. Using the external dispositions, you can then easily simulate documents that lead to a shortfall in stocks and cover documents and thus check the correct evaluation of the B&B list. Scenario 1: Replacement time x: \"\" -> All documents are taken into account. The cover document is classified as \"too late\". 1 -> All receipts within the replenishment lead time are taken into account. Thus only the demand on 2.8. is reported. The cover document is also not displayed. 2 -> All documents are taken into account. The cover document is classified as \"too late\". Return priority: First -> Regardless of the replenishment time, the shortfall of the reorder point on 2.8. is always displayed. Schl.-> If the period of the replenishment lead time is considered, the shortfall of the reorder level is displayed. For all other periods (\"\", replenishment lead time * 2, 3, .) the negative stock is reported. Scenario 2: Select type of analysis: Strict -> If the analysis type is set to \"strict\", the latest possible date for cover documents of the cover document is always selected, i.e. 1.8. Thus, we run into the negative on withdrawal and the cover is classified as too late. Soft -> The earliest possible date for cover documents is always selected. Thus, part is not displayed in the B&B list, as there is no stock shortfall. Info: For documents that reduce the stock, the date is set exactly the other way round. Thus, for the setting \"soft\", the end of the period is always assumed and the beginning for the setting \"strict\". Scenario 3: (WEEinkauf 29) Type of analysis: Strict -> Monday is assumed for the requirements document. Thus, the coverage must also take place on Monday so that the B&B list is clean. Medium -> The time specifications are naturally compared with each other. Thus, a negative stock is displayed if the coverage has not taken place by Wednesday (16.7.). Soft -> The B&B list is always clean as long as the coverage takes place in the corresponding calendar week. Module name: autopure.mod. Classes: CX_ITEM."

Definition: The average price is stored in the warehouse account of the respective part as price per quantity (for display, see logistics account) and is continuously updated. The calculation rules are not defined in the program code, but in the database by the transaction descriptions for corresponding stock-related documents. As calculation basis the roll price of the part (production part/order item) or the price of the document can be used. This setting can be made under the client, see. In both cases the average price is in the logistics account, but it is calculated on a different basis. On each document the current price iswritten offfrom the document \"pricePer\" and from the role\"last.defaultPricePer\". You can check the existing average prices of the stocked parts in the menu \"Services --> Materials management\" in the index card \"Stock account\". See Currently the following standard scheme is used: Whenever the average price is changed, the date of the change is also saved in the warehouse account. Invoice: The average price is adjusted with each purchase of material as follows: The value for the access price is taken from the slot pricePer (= document price) or last.defaultPricePer (=roll price) depending on the setting in the client. ( old stock * old average price + receipt quantity * receipt price ) / ( old stock + receipt quantity ) ==> new average price Average price is adjusted with each physical inventory document as follows old average price = average.pricePer valuation price = pricePer ( old stock * old average price + counted quantity * valuation price - target quantity * average price ) / ( old stock + counted quantity - target quantity ) ==> new average price The new average price is then rounded to the number of decimal places specified in the system (e.g. for Euro = 2 decimal places) and standardised to the previous per-factor (see examples below). At the same time, this calculation scheme ensures that the respective warehouse account is correct at all times (see also special case 3 below): ( initial stock value + total of all receipts - total of all issues ) / (initial stock + total of all receipts - total of all issues ) = average price Special cases:.

        "output": "Invoice or credit note: This module is used to maintain invoices and credit notes. An invoice is a receipt (document) by which a natural or legal person asks the recipient of a delivery or service to pay the agreed price within a certain time. A credit note is used for settlement in the same way as an invoice for a delivery or service. The credit note is issued by the recipient of the goods or services and not by the supplier. Instructions for printing invoices and credit notes can be found here. Structure of the invoice/credit note: When creating an item-related invoice, the order structure is basically taken over and retained, but shifted down one level, e.g: A credit note can be created from invoice items (item-related) or for an order header (flat rate). When creating an item-related credit note, the invoice structure is basically taken over and retained, e.g: When creating a flat-rate invoice or credit note, a single subgroup is created representing the order header, e.g:. VAT invoice: As a rule, an invoice is taxed at a single rate. This VAT is determined by the customer or the business transaction and is indicated in the invoice header. In this case, it is easy to calculate the amount of tax as it is calculated on the full net value of the invoice. For account assignment, this means that the entire tax value is posted to the VAT account of the tax key specified in the invoice header. However, this \"ideal\" calculation is not always applicable. For example, several rates may be applied to the same invoice where an invoice covers both \"normal\" and reduced-price goods. In this case, part of the goods are taxed at 19% and another part at 7%. In this so-called additional tax calculation, each item can be assigned its own tax rate. This means the following for the entry of the invoice. In the invoice header, the tax rate should be specified which is to be applied to the invoice by default. (for domestic customers this would be 19% VAT). No tax then needs to be specified on the normally taxable items, as the following rule applies. If an item does not have a tax key, the tax defined in the next higher item with a tax applies. Consequently, only the reduced items must be assigned the different tax. If these items are all combined in one group, the tax can also be defined once in the group, as the rule mentioned above is applied again. The consequences of the additional tax calculation are obvious. During account assignment, not only one tax account is addressed, but the number of accounts is equal to the number of tax keys used. In addition, the gross amount results from the addition of the gross amounts of the items and not from the calculation: total net value times tax key of the header. If the invoice has a fixed sum, the resulting tax difference to the real position values is divided proportionally according to the tax values of the positions. This means that an item with a tax of 0% can never have a tax value. The indication of the tax can already be made in the order. When creating the invoice, the tax is then transferred to the corresponding items and groups. Further processing of invoices/credit notes: As soon as an invoice/credit note is registered, most input fields are blocked. So booking can mean \"block the stand that was sent to the customer\", if the invoicing looks like this: Create invoice / credit note à print à register. Only when an invoice/credit note is registered, the preceding documents are adjusted accordingly, e.g. business process statuses are forwarded (examples: item-related invoice registered à corresponding delivery note and order items forwarded to \"invoiced\"; item-related credit note registered à corresponding invoice forwarded to \"credited\", etc.).

Each bill of material item describes which parts are required in which quantity for the production of a manufacturing part. There are two item types of a bill of material: Single item Variant item (conditional parts list item) The basic heading contains a part from the parts master that is required in the specified (constant or calculated) quantity. A variant item is a conditional list of single items. When exploding the bill of material, the (single) item whose condition is fulfilled first is used. If a subpart (of a variant part) is inserted into a bill of material, its characteristics are not automatically transferred, as these bills of material do not represent master data. During further processing of the parts list in orders or similar, the master data of the individual parts \"shine through\" and can then be changed later. Input window: This window is used for maintaining parts lists. You can select a parts list by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If several bills of material exist with the number, the selection window is displayed and you can select the desired bill of material. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". Enter a corresponding part-/drawing number and in the field 'Description' the name of the part. The creation date and the editor are predefined by the system and can be changed. Before you can add parts list items, a new parts list must be saved. Before you use a bill of material (which contains conditional items or calculated/conditional quantity specifications), you should test it (bill of material inspection). You can also \"sort positions\" in the \"Positions\" submenu: There the positions of the current parts list are sorted anew - according to a freely enterable and then ascending position number. Parts list display: If, in the list of parts list items, the symbol is output, then it is a part that is now valid as an exchange object of an originally inserted part object. In the parts list editing mask there are two possibilities for visualising the parts list. One is the display as a modular parts list, in which only the items of the first level are displayed. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"370\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} In addition, the entries of possible variant parts list items can be displayed via the variant checkbox. The parts list items can be selected with the button can be displayed in the tree view. Then the complete structure of the called up parts list is displayed - including all structures of the sub parts lists occurring in the parts list itself. This output is for viewing only, editing is (currently) not possible. The structured parts list can also be displayed in list form (radio button), for this purpose you can also specify the desired depth to which you want to track the parts lists. (The parts list report is only recommended in this list display) With the checkbox \"also display invalid items\" all items of the parts list can be displayed, i.e. also those on invalid set parts list items. With the button you can display the MRP product structure of the bill of material. Inspection parts list: You can check whether the parts list has been entered correctly via the menu item 'Parts list inspection'. The window 'Inspection Bill of Material' opens. Via 'Edit - Resolve' you can select the scope of the test and via 'Edit - Delete test resolutions' you can undo tests. If a parts list cannot be exploded, the system will display an error message.

Parts list items (search results): If a search was carried out using set attributes, the positions to which the search applied are displayed here. A search for attributes applies if the subitem itself has the attribute you are looking for in any specified form, or if the subitem has a formula or conditional table as a quantity that contains this characteristic. For quantities as formulas or conditional values, the value of the characteristic is never checked. This means that if you search for LENGTH=34mm, a BOM/routing item is not displayed, even if it contains a quantity table with an entry LENGTH=34mm. Likewise, conditional BOM/routing items whose condition exactly matches the searched expression are not found. Only if this position also has the fixed attribute LENGTH=34mm, it will be found. So if you want to search all conditional entries and formulas for an attribute, you have to use the search on \"available\". A double click on an entry opens the editing mask of the position."

The maintenance of the financial years is usually the responsibility of the controlling department. For fiscal years and their periods, any time periods can be entered, e.g. to be able to specify a short fiscal year. After logging in to the system, the closest posting period is automatically registered by means of the session date - when the system is started it corresponds to the system or current date. If the session date is not in a business period declared as started, a warning message is displayed. The currently logged on fiscal year is displayed in the bottom line of the main window. You can - after logging in to the system - change the session date at any time or change to another started fiscal year. In all document masks (outgoing invoices, material postings, time sheets, financial postings, etc.) all started posting periods of the currently logged in - started - business year are always offered for selection. As a rule, however, only one period is/should be started at a time. At the beginning of a new month, two periods are often temporarily started in order to be able to add postings from the previous month. To give the accounting department time for the closing operations of a period, this period is first declared as \"finished\". This means that it can no longer be selected in all other areas outside accounting. A period is finally closed when it has the status \"archived\". Input window: After a fiscal year has been created (see the description of the fields), the periods within the fiscal year must then be entered. The total period of the fiscal year should completely cover the periods of the individual periods. If the periods correspond to calendar months, they can be generated automatically (see menu item \"Generate periods automatically: Months\"), otherwise please create the sub-periods individually. In the sub-periods you must also set the status of a period to be posted to 'started'. By double-clicking on one of the created periods you can edit it. As a rule, you will divide a fiscal year into 12 periods (months). If you want to set up a 13th posting period (or even more) for closing operations, you can set up individual days or limited periods of the last period as posting periods: for example, 30.12.07 and/or 31.12.07 or 28.12.07-31.12.07, 29.12.07-31.12.07.

        "output": "Capacity planning: To be able to calculate the planned workload of an employee, workstation, machine or other resource against the available time budget, a total planned time for a period (usually calendar weeks) must be entered. Here the full working time is given without taking holidays into account, e.g. for employees with 40 hour weeks for one year 8 hours daily. Capacity planning therefore only forms the basic time frame of the employee. Absence times, such as holiday or illness, are maintained via the employee's absence times, which automatically reduces the planned capacity in this period by the employee and all assigned work groups. Employees and work groups can be planned precisely by the day, other resources only by the week. For employees, it is advisable to schedule the capacity in normal daily working hours, i.e. as a rule, 8h is entered in the Capacity field and the grid is set to \"Days\". The weekly working time is only extrapolated and also entered for employees on the basis of the daily capacity (8h) times the number of working days within the calendar week. An evaluation is therefore later possible both on a daily and weekly basis. The planned capacity is then saved by clicking on the \"Set capacity\" button. General capacity planning: Planning the capacity for a resource is always done in 3 steps (please refer to the links to the different areas for more detailed explanations of the individual topics) Step 1: Set the available capacity of the resource Step 2: Planning of requirements Step 3: Overview of the planned capacity:. Input window: Capacity planning is carried out in the specified period (date range) in the selected grids (calendar weeks by default). These grids should only be changed in connection with the change in the posting of work sequences, so that the working times actually posted can actually be calculated against the planned times entered. For employees, the standard grid is \"days\". With \"Set capacity\" the entered planned times within the entered time period are then written to the resources (employees, workstations, work groups) located in the list \"Selected resources\" below. Specificity Staff capacity+working group capacity: If the capacity of employees is set in days (grid \"days\"), the sum of all newly planned working days contained in a week is also transferred to the superordinate week. In addition, the capacities of all work groups to which the employee is assigned are adjusted. The capacity of work groups is thus automatically determined based on all assigned employees. If employees (who already have a capacity planning) are assigned to work groups at a later date, the total capacity of the work groups can be determined automatically. To do this, use the menu item \"Capacity planning-->Determine capacity from subordinate resources\"(see below in the \"Menu\" table) When recalculating the capacity, the already planned absences of the employees are automatically taken into account. So if an employee has an entered absence (holiday or illness.) on one day, then this time period will not be occupied with new capacity even if the capacities are reallocated!.

        "output": "Capacity utilisation: This module was implemented in order to get an overview of the overall utilisation of all resources in the company. It offers the possibility to see at a glance for a selected time period by means of green, yellow and red boxes, whether the actual booked workload is higher than the planned capacity, which is available to a resource, e.g. due to assigned employees (e.g. 4 employees of 40 hours each per week = 160 hours capacity at the machine). Employee deployment planning This capacity utilisation list can also be used for the scheduling of employees: Tasks from service provider groups, work orders and service assignments are posted to the employee's planning pool. In this way, it is possible to monitor which employee is working at what time and to what extent, or where he or she may be out in the field, absent due to holidays, illness or other reasons, or whether he or she is on emergency duty for the selected calendar week. For the capacity planning of employees there are a few special features: Flexitime days Flexitime absences can be entered via the employee mask. These are then displayed in the overview with a blue symbol with a white square. This should then mean that the employee is free (blue means no capacity due to holidays, illness or other absence), but can be contacted in case of bottlenecks. For this reason, there is a different symbol for the \"flexitime\" absence than for all other full-day absences where the reason cannot be identified. Emergency services The emergency service is also determined by an employee's absence. The overview then checks whether the employee has an emergency service on the first Monday shown and displays this in red under the employee name in the list. The emergency services are always valid per week in the usual cases. Receipts posted In order to display the documents that were used to represent the workload, you can use the toolbar or by right-clicking and then using the context menu entry\"Capacity overview\" to jump to a list of booked vouchers divided by calendar weeks. The planned capacity can be entered in the capacity planning module, which can be accessed via the resources (Menu in search list \"Edit - Set - Capacity planning\". It can also be set via the list of the capacity overview by double-clicking. The evaluation and display can be influenced via the option window. Restriction criteria Resource In the area \"Resource\" you can set for which type of resource an evaluation should be made. The following resource types are available: Production area Workplace Working Group Machine Employees Depending on the selected resource category, a restriction option appears in the embedded subgroup \"Selected resource\" to start the evaluation for only one resource or only one production area which in turn can contain several resources. It is also possible to drag and drop resources into the list. However, if there are several entries, the option \"Empty list before new search\" in the option window must be deactivated first. Evaluation options There are two other ways to generate the evaluation: by the day or by the week. However, this option is only possible for employees and work groups. List view The list can be displayed in various ways: Quick overview - coloured boxes are displayed for a quick overview of whether there is sufficient capacity for the booked requirements Detailed - No coloured boxes were used. In this mode all relevant data is displayed divided into columns, e.g. total demand, overhang, projected demand Shift plan - The shift plan is a short overview that also shows for which customer the planned capacity is needed, or for which customer the employee was scheduled. This is determined exclusively from booked service provider groups from quotations and orders. This way it is possible to clearly identify for each employee in a given period of time if and where he is scheduled to work or where he is currently located. - Attention: In order not to make the list too confusing, only the first 50 letters of all locations are displayed per day or per week per resource! So if an employee is at 6 different customers on one day, the exact location can only be determined via the capacity overview ( in the toolbar or by double clicking on the line)! Exemplary example of a deployment plan: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"374\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Attention during employee evaluations: If the evaluation option \"Employee Graphic Mode\" is set, the evaluation logic behaves a little differently than in normal mode: In the list, only the days that have LESS workload than originally planned appear in red. For all other resources it is exactly the other way round, there the overplanning is marked in red. If no capacity has been specified for a booked period, or if an absence has been booked for the employee for this day (illness, holiday, etc.), the blue box is displayed. If the employee has a \"flexitime day\" absence, a white square is displayed in the blue box. Also in the graphics a difference can be seen: In red, the working time is marked that was actually assigned by the daily working time assigned to the employee, but not logged off by hourly data entry. This time is therefore unlogged working time. In white, the bar shows the time that was logged off by a time sheet, but the project hanging on the time sheet has the \"do not calculate\" check mark. This time is considered as working time that cannot be calculated further. In blue, the time is shown in the bar, which has been logged off by time sheets and can also be charged to the customer. Display A time range for the evaluation can be specified in the right group. A possible entry would be 25th week 06 to 30th week 06 or May to June or even 2005 to 2006. The longer the selected time period, the longer the evaluation will take, of course, but the more accurate the development can be, the more accurate the resources can be graphically displayed. Once all the details have been entered, you can click on the button or by pressing Enter in the date field the evaluation can be started. The progress is indicated by a progress bar at the bottom of the screen. When the determination is complete, the result is displayed as shown above: It is now very easy to see in which workstation the workload in which calendar week is greater than planned. The planned workload is calculated by multiplying the number of employees assigned to this workstation by their weekly hours. So if a red square is visible, either the schedule would have to be rescheduled, the employees would have to be asked to work overtime or an external worker would have to be called in for this week in order to increase the planned capacity. The workloads can also be displayed in a graph for individual resources (mark entry in list). For this purpose, the toolbar button to operate. Depending on the display graphics set in the option window, a window with a bar or line chart, flat or in 3D, appears: Here it can be read even more precisely how far a planned capacity has been exceeded or whether the utilisation rate for a resource is permanently lower than planned. In this case, the planned capacity could be reduced by reassigning an employee to a different work area and at the same time the planned capacity could be increased in his new work area. With the help of the graphics, a load overview can also be created retrospectively for a whole year. Overhangs If work from previous periods is still open, this is referred to as overhangs. These overhangs are listed separately as standard. In order to see which documents make up the total of the overhangs, the entry can be marked in the list and the context menu opened by right-clicking on it. In this context menu, select the entry \"Display open documents of previous periods\". The worklist opens and displays all these documents. From here the documents can then be logged off.

        "output": "Cash book: The cash book is used to record the expenditure/receipts of a cash office. You can create as many cash registers as you wish, and keep a record of their respective stock. Cash vouchers can be immediately assigned to an account when they are entered, but it is important to keep the cash balance correct. A cash balance is done in 2 steps: first a cash report is created, whereby their cash receipts are removed from the current cash book. The cash documents of a cash report can be changed afterwards only with regard to their period or account assignment. In the second step a cash report can then be transferred to the financial accounting. The cash documents of a cash report posted in financial accounting cannot be changed. Cash book entry, cash invoice, cash sale: The standard case of a cash book transaction is a cash book entry, which consists of a transaction description, a revenue/expenditure amount and, if applicable, a tax value. If you want to put brackets around several cash book entries, this is a cash invoice. Cash invoices can be incoming and outgoing invoices. In the case of incoming invoices, for example the entry of a petrol station invoice for petrol and food, it is possible to enter the number of the invoice freely. Among other things, you can select a supplier as a partner. Then you can add the items to the cash invoice. This step hardly differs from the \"normal\" functionality of the cash book. The cash invoice becomes interesting when selling goods without open items, the so-called cash sale. When entering these invoices, the invoice number is automatically assigned via a separate number range. An invoice recipient does not have to be selected, but in addition to a customer created in ClassiX, it could also be a one-time customer whose data is only recorded in the invoice. Especially for the second case, it may be useful to select a price base group (price group, customer group, sales area). For cash sales invoices it is possible to specify a part and a quantity. Here, the stocked part or subparts must be indicated directly. The selection of a variant part is not possible, as this cannot be in stock. The sales price is determined automatically as revenue. After the cash invoice has been recorded, it can be printed and handed over to the customer. The second step is to create the stock removal so that the stock level correction can be carried out. This is done automatically via the menu \"Further processing\". As long as this step has not been carried out, it is not possible to generate the cash report. Main window: This window is used for the maintenance of account books. When a new cashbook is created for the first time, the fields of the Inventory group must be filled in and in the Settings tab, the appropriate G/L account of the cash register in Financial Accounting can be selected. List window: Serves to list all cash books kept in the system. Selection window: This window is used to select a specific cashbook object. Set balance carried forward: The balance carried forward / balance of the cash register can be set again. This should only be necessary if the wrong opening balance was entered when a cash book was first created. Otherwise, the (missing) balance of a cash register must always be adjusted via a posting. Cash voucher window: Window for entry/editing of a single cash voucher. Create cash report: The creation of a cash report from current cash documents can be called up via the main menu \"Edit>Cash report>Create\". Here, either selected documents can simply be printed, or documents up to a consecutive number can be transferred (closed and posted) as a cash report. The transfer of the cash vouchers into a new cash report may only take place in a continuous number range from the smallest number not transferred to the number to be entered. If the option \"Selected items\" is activated, no closing can be created. Cash report: Window for displaying the cash documents of a cash report. Even after the creation of a cash report - but only before the posting in the financial accounting - the cash report entries can be changed with regard to their account assignment, the change of an amount is no longer allowed at this point. Editing can be done either by double-clicking on a single entry or by selecting several entries, right-clicking and selecting \"Account Assistant\". In the latter case, changes can be made to the account assignment of individual entries, particularly by the financial accounting department, before posting a cash report. Edit cash report: Window for subsequent processing of a cash voucher that has already been converted into a cash report. The structure of the window corresponds to the entry window of a cash document, but only the period or the account assignment of the cash document can be changed. Edit cash report: Window for subsequent processing of a cash voucher that has already been converted into a cash report.

        "output": "Terms and conditions: Business conditions (conditions) are objects that extend the functionality of business objects in a certain way or define additional properties; compared to attributes, conditions combine more complex data structures. Business condition Warranty defines for example warranty period and number of shifts, business condition Freight - freight value, calculation type, G/L account and freight table. A distinction is made: Terms of payment (terms of payment, partial payment) Calculatory conditions or discounts and surcharges (discount, packaging surcharge, etc.) other conditions (pricing, delivery time, etc.). Text modules (text module) Terms of payment and text modules are described individually (see links above). All conditions (except text modules) are divided into two areas: Purchase and sales conditions:. Input window: This window is used to maintain business conditions. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". Application of business conditions: Terms and conditions can be created and used at different levels. A quotation to a customer is used below as an example, but the principle is applicable to all types of documents e.g. supplier + purchase order etc. Terms and conditions can be created or inserted system-wide, at the customer's premises or directly with the offer. As a rule, terms and conditions of business are applied system-wide as they have general validity for the company. These can be, for example, the different payment methods of the company. It is also possible to create several similar business conditions. (e.g. payment target 30 days 3% discount, payment target 30 days 2% discount) The actual selection of which of these conditions will actually be applied is only made in the offer. These system-wide terms and conditions can now be used in various ways. These terms and conditions are referred to differently depending on the position of your use. Discount: In the field 'Name' you can enter a name for your new entry. Under short text you can choose between different types of discount. In the 'Receipts' field you can define the areas of use by ticking the boxes.

In the field 'Value' you can choose between 2 types of discount and 2 types of surcharge. The discount value can either be calculated as a percentage or as a € value. You can test the discount or surcharge function using the button shown and it is also possible to set a time limit for the validity. In the field 'Processing' you can decide by ticking the box whether the discount rate should not be shown on the later documents, whether the discount rate should be calculated from each individual value of goods or only once from the total value of the order. After the intermediate storage with 'OK' the field 'Description' is released, in which you can open MS-Word with a double click and enter a text. To edit the different discount rates, simply double-click on the entry you wish to edit in the 'Discounts/Surcharges' search mask.

        "output": "Company modules. Description: This module is used to maintain company data. A company is mainly described by its master data, such as name, commercial register and tax numbers, and its address(es). User-specific data of a company is stored and maintained in role objects such as customer, supplier, manufacturer, operator, etc. Any number of different roles can be assigned to a company. The master data of a company represents the basic information that is known in all roles. Linking different (property) role objects to a company object thus ensures that no redundant data can arise. A company can generally be understood as a company location. A company location basically has only one postal street address, which can, however, be recorded several times (as a so-called sub-address) in order to locate various buildings, entrances (gates), etc. at this location more precisely (by means of a corresponding address supplement). The employees working at a location are assigned to this company location with their telephone numbers, etc. and can additionally be assigned to a specific place of employment at this location (one of the main or sub addresses of the location). Within a company location, areas can be assigned to a company. Areas are to be understood as \"locations within the location\" in order to be able to better manage the allocation of employees, sub-addresses, especially for very large companies or institutions such as public authorities (division into departments), hospitals (division into wards) or universities (division into departments and therein again into institutes). The information content of areas basically corresponds to the information content of a company location, therefore company locations can be converted into areas of other company locations (and vice versa). Areas can be structured in any depth and can be recognised by the symbol . The areas of a company are maintained here. (Postal) different locations of one and the same \"legally registered\" company are called branches. A \"head office\" cannot be a branch of another head office at the same time, this mapping is only single-level. \"Head offices\" are marked in list views with the symbol , \"Branches\" with the symbol . If a company is assigned a \"head office\", this company is automatically registered internally as a \"branch\". This registration is reversible. One effect of the relationship of companies as branch and head office is, for example, that one cannot give a person the role as \"contact person\" of one's own company (client) or one of its branches. It is only possible to give such persons the role of \"employee\" (see place of employment). The relationship between \"head office\" and \"branches\" of a company are maintained here. In addition, companies that are legally different from each other can be linked to each other on a pro rata basis. For this purpose, companies can be assigned to parent companies as affiliated companies. If a company is assigned to a group of companies, this company is shown in list views with the symbol marked. The information on affiliated companies is maintained here. Input window: All menu items are still locked if a new company is entered. The input mask for entering a new company address is called up via the Company module (command Insert Company under Edit). The various company-specific communication data (address, telephone, fax, e-mail, Internet), bank details, contact persons, branch offices, etc. are entered here. Any number of communication data, bank details, contact persons, branches and search terms can be assigned to a company. Company Internet Wizard: In this window, the data of a company can be automatically entered or compared with the data found on the Internet (home page or imprint). Editing a company with this wizard is started either directly with a company already stored in the database (via the respective menu item \"Companies Internet Wizard\"), by dropping a stored company into the Match/Master data group of this window or by directly entering a new www address in the \"Home page\" field. List window: This window serves to list the companies. If a company has multiple addresses, telephone numbers or fax numbers, only the first data in the company list is displayed. On the right side of the window, there is a list of the roles and communication objects of the currently selected company. Communication objects can be edited with a double click. Double-clicking on a role takes you directly to its input window. With a right click, the context menu can be called up to create new roles or to display the validity. Selection window: This window is used to select the companies. If a company has multiple addresses, telephone or fax numbers, only the first data in the list of companies is displayed.

A cost object thus describes a business object to which various existing objects and various documents can be assigned. Internal cost units are e.g. own development orders or trade fair appearances.

        "output": "Marketing cost unit (sales opportunity): Along with cost types and cost centres, cost objects are part of cost accounting. However, the term cost object is also used synonymously - depending on the field - with the term project (order processing), the term framework agreement (purchasing) and the term internal cost object (e.g. R&D). A cost object thus describes a business object to which a wide variety of inventory objects and a wide variety of documents can be assigned. Within the marketing or sales acquisition process, marketing cost objects or sales opportunities form the second stage after the assignment of an interested party object or lead. The documents assigned to a cost object, i.e. the documents posted with a cost object can also contain costs/services. Thus, costs/services can be assigned to a cost object either directly via financial accounting or via special (cost) documents (e.g. time sheets). Inventory data of a plant (industrial plant, machine, part (e.g. for development projects)) and/or a business partner(prospective customer, customer, operator) or an operative partner(prospective customer, operator) can be assigned to the cost units themselves. Transaction data such as offers or orders can also be assigned to the cost units. Here, a \"project\" is thus the superordinate node for various offer or order documents. Usually at the beginning of a quotation processing there is the definition of a project, with specification of the external and internal project manager, the assignment to a plant and possibly also the determination of a first rough cost framework(order/sales planning) and a time schedule(network), which can be imported directly from a planning by means of MS-Projects and can also be reconciled with it.

However, the term cost object is also used synonymously with the term sales opportunity (marketing/sales), the term project (order processing) and the term internal cost object (e.g. R&D), depending on the specialist area. A cost object thus describes a business object to which a wide variety of inventory objects and a wide variety of documents can be assigned. The documents assigned to a cost object, i.e. the documents posted with a cost object can also contain costs/services. Thus, costs/services can be assigned to a cost object either directly via financial accounting or via special (cost) documents (e.g. time sheets). A company can receive different types of incoming invoices. The majority of incoming invoices are based on a purchase order, through which the invoice is entered in ClassiX. Thus, the invoice can be entered semi-automatically with regard to the data and an automatic invoice verification can be carried out against the order. A second type of incoming invoice are \"free invoices\", which are usually entered manually in the system without direct trigger/predecessor and therefore always have to be checked manually. By creating purchasing cost units, invoices for a maintenance, leasing or rental contract, for example, can also be entered and checked semi-automatically even though they are not preceded by a purchase order. Especially with monthly maintenance invoices, a manual run means regular, unnecessary additional work. The purchasing cost unit represents the contract concluded between the company and the customer.

A cost object thus describes a business object to which a wide variety of inventory objects and a wide variety of documents can be assigned.The documents assigned to a cost object, i.e. the documents posted with a cost object can also contain costs/services. Thus, costs/services can be assigned to a cost object either directly via financial accounting or via special (cost) documents (e.g. time sheets).A (specialised) sales cost unit can be assigned inventory data of a plant (industrial plant, machine, part (e.g. for development projects)) and/or a business partner(customer, interested party, operator) or an operative partner(interested party, operator).Transaction data such as offers or orders can also be assigned to a sales cost unit. In this case, a \"project\" is thus the superordinate node for various offer or order documents. Usually at the beginning of a quotation or order processing there is the definition of a project, with specification of the external and internal project manager, the assignment to a plant and possibly also the determination of a first rough cost framework(order/sales planning) and a time schedule(network), which can be imported directly from a planning by means of MS-Projects and can also be reconciled with it.Using certain buttons in the toolbar, quotations and orders can therefore be created directly from a sales cost unit. Framework contracts and call orders: Blanket orders can also be defined above a sales cost object. The sales cost object takes over the definition of the outline agreement, for example, the partner and the contract period are defined. The \"Framework contract data\" tab is used to define the items, the total quantity agreed in each case and the price negotiated (project price). For this purpose the module of customer agreements is used. The call-off orders are recorded as normal sales orders, which are assigned to the outline agreement as cost objects. The creation of a call-off order is initiated via the sales cost object. For this purpose, the articles which are called off by the customer are selected in the list. Then the sales order with the order items is created via the context menu \"Create call order\". The respective quantity called off and the delivery date must be entered in the order item. In the customer agreement, the order items called up are listed in the \"Receipts\" tab. In addition, the quantity called off is displayed in the tab \"Framework agreement\".

Data fields that are shown are changed in the sales cost units by the Wizzard. These groups are not changed by hiding them. List window: Serves to search and list cost units. Status: The status of the insurance provider defines the different statuses that an insurance provider can have. The status is defined via the evaluation group \"COST_OBJECTIVE_STATE\". This evaluation group can contain both simple structure nodes and structure statuses . In the case of structure status, the status is automatically determined by transition conditions in further structure statuses. All simple structure nodes are displayed for selection and the structure statuses are displayed at the beginning of the status chain. Thus, for example, the structure term \"COST_OBJECTIVE_STATE\" could be structured as follows: - Completed - Releases In this example, the statuses FINISHED and RELEASED can be set in the cost object by the user. FINISHED blocks the complete processing of the cost unit. No additional data can be added to the cost unit. Existing data cannot be edited. RELEASED releases the processing of the cost unit. Additional data can be added to the cost unit. Existing data can be edited. {img fileId=\"532\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Options for the processing and use of the parts can be stored at the individual statuses.

If none of the three possible options is made (across compartments or shelves or the same X, Y coordinates), then each of the previously selected storage bins receives its own access node object. Currently, only one of the three options can be selected in the standard system. In the newly created access node objects, the X, Y and Z coordinates of the storage bins are transferred; if these are not available, the coordinates from the specifications for aisle, shelf and compartment are transferred. If the selected storage bins have already been assigned to access nodes, processing is cancelled. Create warehouse topography: In this window, you can specify the settings to create a topography of the storage bins, i.e. the access node objects of the storage bins are connected to each other via access route objects, which are also weighted among each other depending on the distance and direction of the access nodes. If access routes have already been assigned to the selected access nodes, processing is aborted. Weighting of access routes: In this window you can enter weights to enter the weight of new access routes or to recalculate the total weight of existing access routes. Check node/path graph: This window shows how many other access nodes can be reached from the access node shown in the list. The number displayed at each access node should be the same as the number of access nodes of a warehouse displayed/selected in the list (see field \"Number / Selected\" at the bottom right of the window), if the graph is fully developed (i.e. all access nodes are \"somehow\" connected via CX_ACCESS_WAY objects).

Start and end point can also be the same for a \"round trip\". This scenario thus represents the \"Travelling salesman problem\" (TSP), which can no longer be calculated in a reasonable time if the number of access nodes entered is too large (already from about 6 nodes).

The possibility to create the preliminary requirement with a quotation makes it possible to plan or execute time-critical orders or production orders already in the final phase of the order placement. The calculation is posted directly with the preliminary requirements document. The assignment of the costs to an order is made via the predecessor. If the predecessor is an order directly or via the order which is the successor of the quotation. Input window - Pre-requirement position: This window is used to maintain preliminary requirement items. If the entry in text fields is terminated with ENTER, the text cursor moves through the fields in the following order Delivery date -> Part -> Quantity -> OK button, or Provision -> OK button It does not make sense to create preliminary requirements for level 0 parts, because the correct sales order item could be created in their place. In the case of constructive assemblies, it is not the constructive assembly itself that must be created as preliminary requirements, but all its subheadings must be created individually as preliminary requirements. The constructional assembly is not a real assembly, i.e. not a final part or component, it merely represents a grouping of parts of a superior assembly which is more clearly arranged for production. Residual quantity management: If a remaining, already planned quantity of an advance requirement item is no longer to be linked, it is possible to create a goods putaway using the open quantity. There is a toolbar button for this in the preliminary requirement item . Furthermore, it is possible to charge off the remaining, not yet allocated quantity at the cost of the cost unit and thus close the advance requirement. To do this, the \"Closed\" checkbox must be set on the advance requirement item and then a reason for closing must be entered. This tick can only be set if no open MRP transactions created directly for this preliminary requirement (for example, a purchase order for which no goods receipt has yet been provided) are registered in the MRP account. Provided that there are still open MRP movements, these must first be closed. List window: Used to list the advance requirement documents. Selection window: This window is used to select an advance requirement object. Option window: All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed with the \"OK\" button. Business Pattern: An advance requirement item always has, if not just a warehouse reservation, at least one follow-up line, namely the line that leads to production or to purchasing of this advance requirement item. However, if this preliminary requirement item is now also assigned to one or more requirements because these have called off the preliminary requirement or partial quantities, this preliminary requirement item has further successors, namely these calling-off requirements, which can either be parts planning items or sales order items. If, for example, one wanted to move back from the incoming invoice of a preliminary requirement item assigned to a parts MRP item to a sales order item, then one would have to A) move back from the ER to the preliminary requirement item, then down the other subsequent string to the parts MRP item, and there finally C) up the other preceding string, possibly through an exploded bill of material, to a sales order item.

        "output": "Asset: With this module of fixed asset accounting, the fixed assets or assets of a company are managed. The fixed assets of a company include all assets that are intended to serve the business operations on a permanent or long-term basis. The fixed asset accounts of the general ledger of the financial accounting are managed as collective accounts. In order to be able to determine the depreciation within the scope of the inventory on the balance sheet date correctly, a fixed asset accounting is required as subledger.The management of fixed assets also includes posting, for example, as additions, subsequent increases or disposals.Since 01.01.2004 the simplification rule has ceased to apply and newly acquired assets are written off pro rata temporis - to the month.Changes in the book value of an asset are made by means of manually or automatically created postings (e.g. automatic depreciation at the end of a fiscal year):AccessOutletPartial outflowAttribution DepreciationCollective depreciationNormally, the module automatically calculates the depreciation allowed for tax purposes at the end of a current fiscal year. In the case of fixed assets for which the calculation of depreciation is generally very individual (e.g. buildings), you can always enter \"individual plan\" as the type of depreciation. This is an indication that the annual depreciation should and will always and only be posted manually. In addition, a depreciation posting can be marked as an annual depreciation posting, which also means that the annual depreciation is not calculated automatically. If asset accounting is newly set up, a standardised import interface is available. Input window: This window is used to maintain fixed assets. You can select an asset by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. The menu item \"Search\" takes you to the \"List fixed assets\" screen of the list window. This screen allows you to search for individual fixed assets by inventory number, search term, G/L account or cost centre and select them by double-clicking. The maintenance of the data is subdivided into general information on the asset, information on tax depreciation and the life of the asset from a tax point of view. Annex: In the \"Asset\" tab, all general information about the asset is maintained:. Features: In the \"Characteristics\" tab, you can add further characteristics data to the asset. Tax depreciation: The tab \"tax depreciation\" displays all the data required by the program to calculate the deduction for wear and tear - also called depreciation or amortisation. This data is filled by postings (acquisition, retirement, year-end closing, etc.) In the lower part of the screen, the taxable annual book values and the corresponding posting types are shown in total from the year of acquisition to the disposal of the respective fixed asset. By deleting postings, it may be possible that an annual account remains in the list without posting values. Such annual values can be deleted by means of the right mouse button and selecting the context menu item \"Remove empty annual account\". Note: you can drag and drop an entry from the list directly into the asset totals list to display the values of a year in detail there. Curriculum vitae (tax): The \"Curriculum Vitae (tax)\" tab shows exactly how the asset has developed over the years and how the book value of the asset is made up of the postings made to the asset. Entries in an annual account that has not yet been closed can be edited and changed subsequently by double-clicking with the mouse. New bookings are triggered via the context menu accessible via the right mouse button. Bookings: Changes to the book value of an asset are made through special entries that can be accessed via the main menu or through the context menu accessible in the life window by right-clicking:. Access: An acquisition posting is made on the one hand when an asset is newly included in fixed asset accounting, but also when the acquisition or production costs are subsequently increased (post-capitalisation). Subsequent costs of acquisition can only be those expenses that do not result in a change in the asset originally acquired and which would ultimately have been classified as acquisition costs at the time of acquisition. Accordingly, the value of a post-capitalisation is added to the residual value of the asset in the (original) year of acquisition and depreciated over the remaining useful life. The situation is somewhatdifferent for capital goods for which \"no depreciation\" is specified as the depreciation type, as these are written off manually (e.g. securities). Here, the date and useful life of later acquisitions (post-capitalisation) is irrelevant for depreciation, as depreciation is calculated and entered manually anyway. For this reason, you enter the actual date of acquisition for such assets in the field Beginning of depreciation (see below) for subsequent acquisitions. If you have made a mistake in the first acquisition posting for an asset (e.g. entered an incorrect A/H date), it is advisable to delete this posting (via the context menu of the postings) AND the resulting annual account (via the right mouse button on the annual account). This also completely resets the tax data of the asset. Disposal: Fixed assets that are no longer available to the company for use are to be derecognised from fixed asset accounting at their book value. In most cases, assets are not derecognised on the balance sheet date but in the course of a financial year. In this case, depreciation must be carried out pro rata temporis in accordance with tax law. As in the year of acquisition, depreciation may be rounded up to full months. The period between the last balance sheet date and the date of retirement is decisive. Partial disposal: Subsequent reductions in acquisition or production costs are to be taken into account in the year of reduction as if the reduction had occurred at the beginning of the year. Attribution: Write-ups are made on the basis of reversals of impairment losses, e.g. if an impairment loss is corrected. Depreciation: With this entry, on the one hand, depreciation and amortisation is carried out for individual planning and, on the other hand, unscheduled depreciation and amortisation is recognised. Collective depreciation: With this programme selection, depreciation can be carried out for several assets at the same time. The structure of the screen is corresponding, the assets to be depreciated are displayed in the second tab of the window. Fixed assets can be dragged and dropped from the fixed asset list window or from the fixed asset summary list into this list.

This module is used to load, compare and maintain commodity codes according to the combined nomenclature of the EU and the SOVA master file of the Federal Statistical Office in Germany. The Combined Nomenclature is the classification of goods (list of commodity numbers) issued by the EU for statistical purposes in intra-Community trade (eurostat). The Federal Statistical Office of the Federal Republic of Germany provides the nomenclature in the form of the commodity code index as a link to the Sova master file (e.g. for the year 2012 in the file SOVA2012.txt). In addition, data on eurostat are also available as a download on the pages of the European Commission(http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon). There you can find the download of the combined nomenclature (in different official languages) under the metadata on the classification server and further as a selection of the combined nomenclature of the respective current year (e.g. for 2012: Combined Nomenclature, 2012).

Since the total scope of these commodity number directories far exceeds the classification required by a company in the partial master, only those commodity numbers are (should be) maintained with this module that are actually required and used.The above data of the Combined Nomenclature are published annually and must be checked against the own data. This module also serves this purpose. Input window: This window is used to maintain commodity codes. List window: This window is used to list the commodity codes registered in the machine, import commodity codes, and automatically assign parts to commodity codes. Selection window: This window is used to select commodity codes. Download Combined Nomenclature: The combined nomenclature can be loaded from one of the files provided by the EU or the German Federal Statistical Office (SOVA Leitdatei). These files are only valid for one year, i.e. new commodity codes are added, other commodity codes are no longer valid after a certain point in time. Therefore, after loading a new file, the commodity codes that are no longer valid are listed. The parts assigned to these - no longer valid - commodity codes can be reassigned to another, still valid commodity code via the window for reassigning commod ity codes. Import used commodity codes: An Excel file previously created with the inspection run Missing commodity codes or another Excel file with the commodity codes used in the parts master can be read in under this menu item. The commodity numbers imported in this way can then be supplemented with the data from the SOVA master file in a second step with the programme run Load Combined Nomenclature. All commodity numbers that were not found in the SOVA master file are listed at the end of the programme run. These incorrect commodity numbers can also be identified by missing texts. These incorrect commodity numbers exist in the system and must therefore be corrected manually and then supplemented again with data from the SOVA master file. Assign part numbers to commodity codes.: With this program run, an Excel file with assignments between part and commodity numbers can be read in. At the end of the programme run, the part and commodity numbers not defined in the system are output on the screen, as well as in the log file. Reassign parts of a nomenclature: In this window, the parts of previously selected commodity numbers can be assigned to a new commodity number. In this way, the parts with individual - e.g. no longer valid - commodity numbers can be assigned to a new commodity number. If you have to divide the parts of a commodity code among several other commodity codes, you can also insert combined nomenclatures into the list window of the parts master by drag & drop, whereby the parts of the nomenclature are listed.

Business-relevant data, such as a person 's function, department, business e-mail and telephone extensions, are maintained with this module. For the purpose of a successful CRM, it is also necessary to classify contact persons according to their importance or other criteria (e.g. \"gets Christmas card\"). This can be done by means of general classification terms or user-specific favourites (see additional data). Persons can be employees of different companies at the same time; employee information is role objects for persons.

Counters are required for master data (customers, G/L accounts, parts, etc.) and documents (invoices, orders, purchase orders, etc.) in order to specify sequential numbering. The formatting of the number (e.g. whether with or without leading zeros) is also determined in the counter. Usually, the name of the meter is the same as the class name of the object to be numbered (e.g. CX_CUSTOMER for the customer number meter). The register of a counter can be delegated to the register of another counter. This is used, for example, if the number range for outgoing invoices and outgoing credit memos is to be the same. In this case, the counter for A/R credit notes (CX_CREDIT_NOTE) is delegated to the counter for A/R invoices (CX_INVOICE). A conditional table can also be used to distribute a register to several other counters, e.g. if the number range for orders is to be different depending on the order type.If you want to reset the counters for e.g. A/R invoices at the beginning of a fiscal year, you can create (copy) a separate counter for each fiscal year - controlled by the validity. In this way, for example, the counter \"CX_INVOICE\" for A/R invoices would then exist several times, each with a validity related to the fiscal year. It should be noted that the counter number should include the year of the fiscal year in order to avoid double numbers. Input window: This window is used for maintaining meters.

        "output": "Currency table: The conversion of currencies, unlike the conversion of other units, is a special case in that the relationship (i.e. the exchange rate) between two currencies is not fixed but changes daily. The conversion must be done using a currency table that defines exchange rates between different currencies. This currency table can be present in the system - for individual days or periods of time it may be different - but it can exist several times.In order to be able to differentiate between these - time dependent - currency tables, it is advisable to give the currency tables unique names (e.g. EUROFX for the currency table of the ECB (European Central Bank) which can be updated daily). All currency tables of a certain name are kept apart as to their validity, i.e. only one currency table of a certain name should be valid in the system at any given time. In order to have up-to-date conversion rates, you can have the rates updated automatically via the Internet.Normally, the system converts a value in a foreign currency to the value of the local currency using the currently logged in currency table. In some cases, this may be undesirable, for example, for outgoing invoices, incoming invoices and the transfer of bank statements. In these cases, the currency table valid only on a certain day may be used instead of the currently registered currency table. The necessary settings for this are made in the client (see for outgoing invoices, incoming invoices and bank statements).Besides the currency tables, which are valid for the whole system after logging in, there are also tables which can only be assigned to one company (one customer). (see customer documentation and foreign currency). Direct Conversion: Direct conversion uses exactly one exchange rate to convert one currency into another. The list of exchange rates is run through one after the other and the first exchange rate that can be used for conversion is used. If a conversion is to be possible with several exchange rates, i.e. \"across other currencies\", indirect conversion is to be used. Indirect conversion: In contrast to direct conversions, indirect conversions can be used to convert \"across multiple currencies\". For example, if a \"€\" amount is to be converted into \"$\", it is not necessary to define an exchange rate between these two currencies. If there is an exchange rate between \"€\" and \"£\" and between \"£\" and \"$\", a \"€\" amount can be converted into \"$\" by \"detouring\" from \"£\" to \"$\". The length of the conversion path is irrelevant. Update: As exchange rates are subject to fluctuations, it is necessary to update the currency tables. For this purpose ClassiX® provides a function for automatic updating via Internet. The basis for the update are the reference rates of other currencies to the Euro, which are published daily by the European Central Bank. The rates are available online at http://www.ecb.int/stats/exchange/eurofxref/html/index.en.html. In parallel, the ECB also provides the rates in an XML file, which is more suitable for automatic processing. This XML file is also used by the ClassiX® system to update the currency tables. The update can be done either online, i.e. ClassiX® tries to load the XML file and updates the currency tables, or offline, if no internet access is available. In this case the XML file has to be copied to the computer by other means and can then be read out. Input window: This window is used to maintain currency tables. You can select a currency table by entering the ID of the desired object (e.g. EUROFX) in the \"ID\" field and confirm with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"376\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} The input window also contains a function for automatically updating currency tables of a particular name. This function can be reached via the menu item \"Update\". The sub-menu contains menu items for various sources with current exchange rate data (currently only \"ECB\" (European Central Bank)). Each menu item contains the sub-items \"Online\" and \"Offline\" (or just one of them), which allow updating directly via the Internet or via a locally saved file (in the XML format specified by the ECB). The two types of updating (\"online\" and \"offline\") are explained in more detail below. Online update When updating online, the new course data is downloaded directly from the Internet. For this purpose, a URL must be provided which specifies the source exactly (see also above). {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"380\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} The valid currency table registered in the system is offered as the table (to be updated): only the currencies specified in this table are transferred to a new currency table with the current values. If you want to load all the currencies offered by the ECB or if you had not yet defined a currency table in the system, the \"Table\" field remains empty and you will get a new currency table with all the exchange rates defined by the ECB. (This table could then be adjusted for the unneeded exchange rates in order to have a suitable initial table for the next update). In general, only one currency table may be valid at a time. This table is automatically selected and registered when ClassiX® is started. Therefore the start date of validity must be specified. By default the date of the exchange rate data is selected here. However, the radio button can also be used to select your own date. The currency table currently valid up to this point is automatically marked as invalid. It expires on the day before the start of the validity of the current table. Offline update The offline update works in the same way as the online update, with the only difference that instead of a URL to the data source on the Internet, this time a path to a file with the new course data serves as the basis. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"378\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} In this case (data source \"ECB\") the file \"euroxref-daily.xml\" in the directory Projects\\Data below CX_ROOTDIR is offered as a preselection.

Selection window: This window is used to select a currency table. Overview: For the management of exchange rates ClassiX®provides the classes CX_CURRENCY_RATE and CX_CURRENCY_TABLE. An object of the first class defines a single exchange rate, while an object of the second class contains a table of exchange rates. This table can contain not only exchange rates, but also other (subordinate) exchange rate tables. Currency conversion functionality exists in both classes, but a table is usually used for conversion. Module name: currtabl.mod. Classes: CX_CURRENCY_TABLE CX_CURRENCY_RATE.

In the 'Edit' menu, the document type can be changed to label. The style sheet and the list of blocks are not available in this input window. An OLE object is provided for this purpose, in which the content of the label can be specified (the Word document should be the size of the label). In the application area, a label type can be selected via Type. The second option is to print a label sheet (A4). A label type can be selected via Type in the application area. The label grid must be specified in the module list box (module: label grid) and then modules with the contents can be inserted. When selecting a label raster module, the number of separating columns in a line must be taken into account. This is created manually in the 'configuration.counter' attribute of the document. In example 2 and 3 there are additional cells between the individual cells as separating columns. In order to be able to skip these, it must be known in advance how many are present in a row. If this is not done or is incorrectly specified, the content of the label is written into the separating columns. Example 1: Line without separating columns: configuration.counter = 0 Example 2: Line with one separating column: configuration.counter = 1 Example 3: Line with two separator columns: configuration.counter = 2 The entire contents of the label are placed in one cell at a time.

        "output": "Document module: OLE objects in the document moduleExport / ImportA comprehensive document management system is also available in all ClassiX® applications. In it, you can not only create all your correspondence and all documents, but also design them flexibly and according to your needs. In addition, all documents are automatically managed on a transaction basis. ClassiX® thus implements an electronic document management in which you can find individual documents at any time directly via your business transactions or document history.The document modules are the enveloping objects for the OLE objects. They have a multilingual name, a number, the type, the OLE text and sub-modules.If a document module has submodules, these are taken into account when printing. The system behaves as if the module itself were a document, i.e. all submodules are printed in the same sequence as in the document (see Sequence when printing document modules). Creating a new document block: When creating a new document, the first thing to do is to define the type (document header, list header, list position, .) of the block so that the blocks are used for the correct purpose when printing. In addition to the normal module types, there are also 2 types that are only referred to as auxiliary modules. These are the type \"Copy\" and the type \"Address\". These building blocks are not included in the normal sequence of building blocks in the document and cannot function as sub-building blocks. Special building blocks: Next, the following options can be set for the module. The content of the document module must be defined as follows. Editing the document module in Word: The module is connected to the ClassiX® system by inserting document variables. This is done via the menu insert/field. A window is opened, in which the desired field can be selected. The document variable can be found under the category Document Automation as field name DocVariable. By clicking the OK button a new document variable is created. In the document the entry { DOCVARIABLE \\* MERGEFORMAT } is inserted. A second and faster way to insert a document variable is to use the key combination Ctrl + F9. Connect to dynamic data fields: The dynamic data field must be inserted manually. The name of the data field is entered after DOCVARIABLE. Example: Insert the dynamic data field uniqueID: From becomes { DOCVARIABLE uniqueID \\* MERGEFORMAT }. Connecting with ClassiX® macros: This connection must also be inserted by hand. The macro call must also be entered here after DOCVARIABLE. The call is made via call(macro name) Example: Insertion of the macro OrderItemDescription: From becomes { DOCVARIABLE call(OrderItemDescription) \\* MERGEFORMAT }. Use of members of the ClassiX® objects: Members of the ClassiX® objects are also accessible from Word. To do so, the ClassiX® object is inserted as described above. The access to the object member then follows the C++ convention. Example: Using the String method of the ClassiX® object quantity: From becomes { DOCVARIABLE ordered.shortName \\* MERGEFORMAT }. Use of methods of ClassiX® objects: It is also possible to call object methods from Word. For this purpose, the ClassiX® object is inserted as described above. The access to the object method is then done according to the C++ convention. The transfer of parameters is possible. Example: Using the String method of the ClassiX® object quantity: From becomes { DOCVARIABLE quantity.string(NF_DIMENSIONED,NF_SIG_PRECISION) \\* MERGEFORMAT }. Formatting of document module: The document module can contain all the formatting options that Word offers. These can also be tables to structure the fields in the module. Simple text can also be inserted and freely formatted. Solves common problems when the selected formatting is displayed incorrectly. Flow control: Word offers the possibility to control the process via branching. This is done with the IF instruction. This is inserted via the menu Insert/Field and by selecting the field name IF in the category Document Automation. The entry { IF } is inserted. The instruction must now be filled with the condition and the instructions for the two cases true and false. The entry is to be changed to The inverted commas next to the statement are important. These encapsulate the statement. In almost all conditions it is checked whether a value is present or not. The condition then looks like the following: { IF { DOCVARIABLE uniqueID } <> \" \" \"statement for true\" \"statement for false\" } This example checks whether the data field uniqueID is not equal to (<>) empty. Note that empty in Word is represented by two double quotes with a space between them. ( \" \" not \"\" ) If the condition is still not recognised, the document variable against which the comparison is to be made must also be placed in double inverted commas. Result: { IF \"{ DOCVARIABLE uniqueID }\" <> \" \" \"statement for true\" \"statement for false\" }. Export / Import: export: Individual (selected in the list) or all document modules can be exported; the subordinate document modules are exported as well. The entire documents (together with all used document modules) can be exported in the list module \"Document\". Input window: This window is used to maintain document blocks. You can select a document module by entering the desired ID in the ID field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". In general, your business documents are composed of several elements (document modules): Header first page (e.g. company logo, business address), salutation, footer first page, etc. You then compile a specific document from the predefined modules. You can enter the individual modules directly as text in the 'Document Module' window, but you can also create them in your standard word processing software, such as Microsoft Word. The modules can also be modular. By using 'fields', values can be taken over directly from ClassiX®. For example, you can create serial letters and dunning runs automatically. List window: Used to list the document blocks. Selection window: This window is used to select a document module object. Block usage: This window is used to list the documents that use the current document module. Import of the document modules: For the import of the document modules are required: Document module description file (contains document module header data such as number, name etc. and the list of submodules; default name component.dat) and associated pairs (for simple content) or pair groups (for conditional modules) of the MS Word files (e.g.e.g. 10_1.doc / 10_2.doc for the simple module 10 in two languages or 11_0_1.doc / 11_1_1.doc / 11_0_2.doc / 11_1_2.doc for the conditional module 11 with two conditions in two languages each) Before loading, a query window is used to select what to do with any existing blocks (overwrite, use, cancel).

An EDM system (Electronic Document Management), respectively a DMS(Document Management System) is already integrated in ClassiX®.The advantage of the integrated solution is the direct association of documents to receipts or master data. The drawings of an article can thus be maintained directly via the parts mask and the documents belonging to an order can be directly linked to the ClassiX order.The associations of the transaction data with the documents can be maintained via a separate editing mask, which can be called up via the document history module, for example. In the master data there is a tab \"Documents\" for this purpose, as for example in the parts mask. If this tab is not available on the processing mask, documents can be linked via the transaction folder or directly via the processing mask of the document entry.Both the master data and the transaction data can either refer directly to the documents or via a conditional table. A conditional table is useful, for example, if the documents of a variant part are managed and different versions should lead to different documents.

Equipment, instruments or even complex industrial plants are considered to be plants. A distinction is made between machines that are used in the company's own production process. Projects (cost objects) are (can be) assigned to facilities when they are created. Since most documents are assigned directly or indirectly to a cost object, the reference to an industrial plant is also always given. For example, an industrial plant can be indirectly linked to quotations and or orders via the project assignment (quotation or order header) or indirectly linked to plant group items in quotations and orders via its plant groups and components. One thus obtains an important information tool for service (listing of the service operations of Customer Support) and a reference work for sales and quality assurance. Input window: When creating and editing industrial plants, the main mask \"Industrial plants\" is displayed first, which contains various tabs. In the \"master data\" tab, the main information of an installation, such as number, password, search terms, type, operator, owner, . are specified. In the same window, in the group \"Location/Communication data\", the location of the system is specified, as well as the communication data on how to reach employees at the system location. For this purpose, the address, telephone number, etc. of the installation can be entered by right-clicking. Infrastructure data (characteristics) of the facility are inserted in the next tab (\"Infrastructure data\") via the \"Insert\" button. Asset groups and their components can be displayed graphically in the next tab and inserted with a right mouse click. List window: This window serves to list industrial plants. Selection window: This window is used to select industrial plants. Absence note Create system consultant: An absence note is a special activity note that is posted to the capacity load of the assigned employee. Move projects/orders/assembly groups: Projects, orders and plant groups can be moved between two industrial plants via this window. This window is needed because the normal editing window of the industrial plants can be opened twice and therefore drag&drop is not possible. Thus, the main use of this window is to open the plant group tree of a second industrial plant in order to be able to move positions of the project tree of the current industrial plant into it. Moving always takes place in the following direction: Project tree of the plant displayed in the editing window ->Plant group tree of the window \"Move projects, orders and plant groups\". After the objects have been moved, you can right-click in the attachment field of this window to jump to the target attachment. If you open the project tree here, you should be able to find the moved objects here. Orders are assigned to an industrial plant on the one hand via the cost object. and on the other hand, the plant group and work certificate groups of the orders refer to the components of the industrial plant. When orders are moved, these references are set to the new industrial plant. If an order group is moved, the new industrial plant is transferred to the cost object of the order. However, if a cost object has more than one order, the cost object can now refer to two industrial plants. This means that the remaining orders may also have to be moved. The user is informed of this via the following message: Moving/copying does not move all the asset/work certificate groups of the projects. The projects will therefore subsequently be assigned to several industrial plants. Do you still want to proceed?. Module name: indpledt.mod. Classes: CX_INDUSTRIAL_PLANT."

An installation certificate is always assigned to the employee who performs the work and can therefore also serve as the basis for an expense report. Through assignment to an order or an order item, the costs incurred are accumulated in the order and project within the scope of the final costing (cost unit accounting). For the purposes of cost centre accounting, the cost centre(s) to be debited can be specified directly; by default, the employee's cost centre is always used first. For a percentage distribution of the costs to different cost centres, the cost distribution on the \"Evaluation\" tab can be used. After registering the apportioned cost centre costs, this assembly record appears in the assembly cost allocation book. Proof of assembly vs. group of service providers (work certificate): The proof of assembly and the service provider group are in competition with each other. Both are proofs that are created, for example, by the deployment of fitters. However, they differ in the way the costs are allocated. The costs arising from an assembly certificate are not invoiced directly to the customer. This is the case, for example, for service work under warranty. In contrast, groups of service providers are invoiced as part of a customer order using an invoice. In practice, however, choosing the right document to record the costs incurred can be quite difficult. The service provider group, for example, is generated directly when the service call is entered and is also used for capacity planning. It is therefore created before the service technician carries out the service order. If it turns out during installation that the work carried out is to be considered as warranty after all, the wrong document was chosen. ClassiX supports you with this problem by providing an interface between the documents. From the service provider group, for example, an assembly proof can be generated, if it is a warranty after all. The order group is automatically cancelled and thus not invoiced to the customer. In the opposite case, a service provider group can be initialised on the basis of an assembly certificate, if the alleged warranty was a service order after all.

        "output": "Interim Storage: This module is used to record intermediate storage. Intermediate storage is necessary if a commodity ordered from a supplier is to be sent by direct delivery to a packaging company and from there to the customer. In this example, instead of the direct delivery document on the purchase order, an intermediate storage document is created on which the packer's warehouse is then specified. As a result, the goods are temporarily in the packer's external warehouse (interim storage document acts like a goods receipt). Since it must still be possible to allocate the value of the goods to the company's assets until delivery to the customer, this warehouse stock is also listed in the warehouse statistics. Likewise, in the warehouse account of the part, the warehouse stocks at the possibly different packer companies where the goods are temporarily stored can be viewed. The goods that are temporarily stored via an intermediate storage document are not freely available because they were ordered directly for an order item. For this reason, the goods are also directly marked as reserved in the warehouse account (quantity on hold). So that it is still possible to recognise which requirement reserves this reserved quantity, the interim storage document is displayed in the MRP account via a normal delivery note until its complete delivery. Attention! If the intermediate storage is not available, the intermediate storage document is also NOT registered in the MRP account! Only the total stock of the storage part is counted up (total.quantity), but not the available stock (current.quantity). This also does not increase the quantity put back! However, the stock movements can be seen in the stock statistics. It is advisable to mark the supplier's warehouses as \"not available for planning\" so that it is not assumed that there is a stock in the company which does not exist. In conjunction with an intermediate storage document, the delivery note acts like a goods withdrawal document. It is also listed in the warehouse statistics. The valuation of these goods is, in contrast to the normal warehouse valuation, not based on the average price, but directly on the standard price of the order part.

        "output": "Parts preliminary calculation: Capture of characteristics (optional) Recording cost rates (optional) Select part(s) Calculate Error log Edit Resolved Resources (optional) Transferring the calculation values into the master data Possibly new calculation with changed settings This module is used for the pre-calculation of parts from the parts master. The main screen - from which the preliminary costing is carried out - has three windows/cards: the card with the list of parts to be calculated (parts), a card with attributes (attributes) and a card with cost rates (cost rates). The general procedure of a parts pre-calculation is the following: 0a. Capture physical characteristics (optional) Since a preliminary cost estimate can also be made using variant parts, you can store characteristic values in the Characteristics window in advance: this prevents the interactive query of characteristics during the explosion of the BOMs and routings. This is one way of storing characteristic values. Another is that each preliminary cost estimate can have its own characteristic values, which is described below. Characteristic features can be transferred from the master data (part + production role) by clicking on the \"Transfer\" button above the list of characteristic features. 0b. Recording cost rates (optional) The cost rates in the form of overhead rates for materials, wages, sales and administration are copied by default from the corresponding deposits with the client into the Cost Rates window. These values can be overwritten here. Here, too, each preliminary calculation saves the cost rates for itself and these can be overwritten there. This is also explained in more detail below. 1. select part(s) Here you have the choice between a simple selection by number/text, etc. or via further more complex search criteria, such as warehouse, logistics indicator, etc.\". Only parts that have a production role can be selected for a preliminary costing: the parts list and the routing of a part are defined in the production role. A new preliminary cost estimate is automatically created for each newly selected part. This preliminary cost estimate is given its own number and is stored with the production role of the part. Any existing characteristics from the Characteristics window and the cost rates from the Cost Rates window are also copied into the preliminary cost estimate. In addition, you can insert or change characteristics manually, for example, if none have been specified in the main window or if they are insufficient. Just as in the main window, there are two ways of inserting here: A lot size is also copied into the preliminary calculation: This depends on the \"Lot size\" option, according to which the lot size is copied from the production roll or from a manual specification. It is also possible to draw results of the sales item turnover statistics into the parts pre-calculation list. In the sales article sales statistics, it is possible, for example, to display all spare parts with a positive sales volume in the current statistics period and to start the preliminary calculation for these parts only. 2. calculate The (or all) parts selected in the list can then be pre-calculated. You can choose between a calculation according to standard values (only the characteristics and cost rates from the pre-calculation windows are taken into account) or an individual calculation: the values from the saved pre-calculation are taken. If neither the values in the preliminary costing nor the values in the windows have been changed after selecting a part, both procedures are of course identical. During costing, the parts list(s) and routings are exploded according to the specifications under Option/Stage. The respective status of an explosion is displayed in the status line of the precalculation window. At the end of a cost estimate, the new values for material and labour (per lot size) and thus the manufacturing costs (per 1 unit) are displayed. 3. error log Possible errors in the explosion of the bills of material and routings, as well as missing valuations, lead to an incorrect preliminary costing. An error log can therefore optionally be output on the screen or written to a file. The following error causes are checked: If a preliminary cost estimate has one or more errors, this data cannot be transferred to the production role of the part as new production costs. 4. edit resolved resources (optional) The resulting bill of material and the exploded routing can be viewed. On the one hand as a structure tree, on the other hand in a tabular form with exact display of the costs and overhead rates. 5. transfer the costing values to the master data. The new(error-free) preliminary costing values are transferred with date to the production role of the part. 6. possibly new costing with changed settings. So that you do not have to fill in a complete preliminary part costing again, for example, inserting material characteristics again and defining them accordingly, possibly even inserting the cost rates or documents, you can copy an already existing preliminary part costing from the list window. This can be done either via the main menu of the list window or via the context menu in the list. The description, lot size, characteristics including features, cost rates and documents (no conditional ones) are copied. List window: On the 'Parts' card, the preliminary costings that are currently being processed are listed. On the 'Characteristics' card of the part costing, you can insert or delete the characteristics which are necessary for exploding the BOMs and routings. The global cost rates from the client are displayed on the 'Cost rates' card and can be changed locally. Option window: Each time the main list window is opened, the options described here are reset to the default settings. Input window: In this window data of a preliminary calculation can be edited and completed. Selection window: This window is used to select a part preliminary costing. Takeover in production role: The preliminary costing can be transferred to the parts roll. This can only be done once.

        "output": "Parts requirement (Gozintograph): Starting from parts scheduling, the production-specific parts lists selected there - sorted according to production stages - are summarised in so-called gozintographs. The parts request module(business pattern) described here is used to maintain such - automatically created - gozintographs.The task of this module is to be able to carry out a purely logistical material planning in a first step. This is done in six steps:Determination of the disposition type of the partsDetermination of the standard replenishment lead time according to the disposition typeScheduling of the necessary provision of parts Checking the availability of materials Triggering of production orders, purchase requisitions and stock reservations Release of the parts requirementLink with ex ante needs Quantity changeDelete direct successor documents Steps 1, 2 and 3 can be called up and carried out directly and automatically as one process from parts planning. The \"standard information\" on the procurement type and time from the master information of the parts master is used as the basis. Steps 3 and 4 (planning) may have to be carried out iteratively several times after manually changing the disposition type and/or procurement time of individual parts so that the planned dates can be met. This planning can also be carried out graphically supported by means of a Gantt chart. Post Calculation: In order to determine which costs have actually been incurred on a cost object (e.g. sales order), all costs ? its follow-on documents must be added up. These are, for example, goods withdrawal slips, BDE deregistrations, incoming invoices etc. Some parts that are required but not planned have no follow-on documents, but must of course still be debited to the sales order. This is done for these parts using the standard quantity specified in the parts list. Only when the parts requisition is released (traffic light on green), all costs of the non-planned parts are allocated to the cost units via the final costing. All further costs arise automatically with the posting of the follow-up document. Disposition types The following disposition types are available for disposition from the parts request: Explanation of the general term \"Kanban Kanban is Japanese and means something like \"card\". It is a practical system of warehouse management in which a card is placed in each box in which parts are managed in the warehouse, under all parts at the bottom of the box. When the box is empty, the card becomes visible. Now the employee who has taken the last part out of the box must take the card and give it to the buyer indicated on the card. Depending on the replacement time of the part, there must then be 2 or more boxes of this part. Every time a box is empty, a new one is ordered. In the time in which the box is ordered but has not yet arrived or is being produced, the remaining boxes are used. 1. determination of the disposition type of the parts Based on the standard logistic identification of a part (in-house production, purchased or externally produced part) and its provision identification (disposable part, stock part, etc.), the type of disposition is automatically determined for each part in the Gozintograph. Thus, for example, non-stock-managed in-house production parts are set to the disposition type \"production order\", non-stock-managed purchased parts to the disposition type \"requirement request\" and stock parts to the disposition type \"material withdrawal\". Material staging indicators such as manual storage part are parts that actually have the MRP type \"material withdrawal\". However, since such parts are not taken from the warehouse on an order-related basis using material withdrawal slips, and are therefore not \"processed\", such parts are set to the MRP type \"No MRP\". Another irregularity is the \"special material withdrawal\". If a part requisition item is set to special material withdrawal, this requirement does not appear in the MRP account, but the item still has the status warehouse reservation - and can therefore be found via the staging list. These items must also be staged here, but no goods withdrawal documents are created. These parts also appear in the production documents as being to be taken from the warehouse. The determination of the disposition type can either be influenced automatically by separate control systems or changed manually. If, for example, a purchased part that is not normally kept in stock should have a stock (e.g. due to a return delivery from a previous order), the system automatically changes the disposition type from \"requirement request\" to\"material surplus \". The same applies to a production part in stock that may have been \"left over\" from a previous order. The parts can then be taken directly from the warehouse. Parts requisitions marked with this MRP type appear in the staging list under \"Stock reservation\". The disposition type defined in a gozintograph - automatically or manually - can therefore be quite different from the \"standard\" procurement type. The \"standard\" procurement type determines the generally valid case and is (should) not (be) changed (modified) for specific orders. A gozintograph is used to completely record the fully resolved parts lists of all parts. If a part is located below or within an assembly whose MRP type is \"requirement request\" or \"material withdrawal\", then this part or its quantity share - together with all parts of its bill of material - need not be considered further for MRP, as it is already contained in its superior assembly. For such parts, the MRP type is set to \"not required\". Conversely, if the MRP type of the superior assembly is changed to \"production order\" (if it is also an in-house produced part), the subordinate parts are automatically taken into account again in the MRP - the quantities (parts) become visible again. The MRP type\"No MRP\" thus refers to parts that are definitely needed or must be used, but should not be planned. The MRP type\"not required\", on the other hand, refers to parts that do appear in the combined bill of material but whose superior part is not to be produced (the superior part does not have the MRP type \"production order\"). The determined or manually defined disposition type is displayed in the column \"Disposition\". In the next column - if necessary - notes are displayed whether the disposition type could cause problems in the following processing stages. If the check fails, a red warning point is displayed: 2. determination of the standard procurement time according to the disposition type The standard procurement time or also replenishment lead time is taken from the production role for the MRP type \"production order\" and from the order article role of the part for the MRP type \"requirement request\". For production parts this is the pure procurement time of the corresponding level (total lead time of the routing only for this production part, not for its assemblies). It is therefore not the total \"delivery time\" of the part. For parts kept in stock (material withdrawals) a duration of 1 day is entered as standard. In addition to the standard procurement time, it is also possible to have the procurement time determined dynamically. This dynamic determination only affects parts that have received the disposition type \"production order\". Here it is now checked whether a routing has already been exploded on the possibly already attached production order. If so, the total time of the exploded routing is saved as the lead time for the parts request item. If a routing does not yet exist for the production order, or if no production order has yet been created at all, the total time of the master routing is saved as the lead time for the parts request item. 3. scheduling of the necessary provision of parts Due to the sequence of the production stages and the procurement times of the individual parts, there is a scheduling network of the parts among themselves (order network), which is best represented in the form of a Gantt diagram. In forward scheduling, this collective order starts on a predefined date (the default value is the day of planning itself). In backward scheduling, the delivery date (or the staging date, if available) is used as the starting point. It is not possible to schedule into the past, i.e. even with backward scheduling the delivery or staging date can be postponed to a later date than desired. (A corresponding warning message is automatically issued by the system, the system then automatically schedules forwards!) An influence on the delivery or provision date can be achieved by changing (shortening or extending) the procurement time: this results in an extension or shortening of the entire order network. The starting point of scheduling - e.g. the delivery or provision date in the case of backward scheduling - is first transferred to the collective order as the\"latest finish date\". If you subtract the procurement time from such a \"latest end date\", you get a\"latest start date\". The different lengths of the procurement times within a production stage result in\"earliest start dates\" for individual parts, which can be earlier than the latest start date. Adding the procurement time to the earliest start date then results in an\"earliest finish date\" again. In automatic scheduling over a period of time (e.g. \"3rd week 2014\"), the last working day of the period is set as the latest end in backward scheduling. This results in the latest start. Subsequently, the earliest start is determined from the latest start by deducting the duration of the period and the earliest end is determined on the basis of this. Excursus: The production orders are transferred to capacity planning with their respective earliest and latest completion dates . Automatic (non-graphical) forward scheduling: See the Automatic Terminationsection See also operating calendar and buffer times In the case of requirements from part requirements (departure date), the planned date is made up of the earliest and latest start, which also results in a time span. With the evaluation type \"Strict\", the earliest date of this time span is always used for the evaluation, with the setting \"Medium\" exactly the middle and with \"Soft\" the end of the time span, i.e. there is the least buffer for the real requirement. If planning (e.g. stock replenishment) is always to be carried out with a little air, the setting \"Medium\" is recommended, which is always set in the standard system. However, if there is little space in the warehouse or if the warehouse budget is always to be kept as low as possible, the setting \"Soft\" is recommended, whereby planning is always carried out on the actual demand date. Strictly means, therefore, that the goods are always already procured at the earliest possible date and may also lie in the warehouse for some time until they are needed, depending on how large the buffer times of the requirements were. 4. checking the availability of materials Checking material availability on the basis of the earliest or latest date in the parts request. This can be moved forward (with -) or backward by days or weeks. This shift is not calculated in calendar days but in working days, i.e. holidays and weekends are not included. During the check, the subsequent part requirements are normally also taken into account, i.e. parts that are available for the order are also displayed, but are in the red due to other orders. If you select the checkbox \"Ignore later requirements\", these subsequent part requirements will not be considered! On the one hand, it is possible to check the availability of stocked material on the desired date by checking the respective MRP account. The entries with the unavailable material are displayed selected in the list. On the other hand, material overhangs can be checked: If a part is by default a purchase or production part, but remaining stock (material surplus) from previous orders is still available, these entries of the list are also displayed selected for further checking. As a reaction, the MRP type can be changed, for example, from requirement request to material withdrawal, whereby this part is no longer procured via purchasing, but is instead withdrawn from existing (surplus) stock. These checks can also be graphically supported by means of a Gantt chart. 5. triggering of production orders, purchase requisitions and stock reservations Once the disposition types and dates for all parts have been defined within the gozintograph, the further documents such as production orders, purchase requisitions and stock reservations can be created automatically. 6. release of the parts requirement The release of the parts request blocks it from subsequent modification. A. Link with ex ante requirements If a sales order item is planned and preliminary requirements have been created for it, the following query appears, for example If you press \"YES\", it means that a remaining quantity still reserved over advance requirements will be withdrawn from this specific sales order, put into stock and thus released for general free disposal. If you press \"NO\" it means that you still want a remaining reserved quantity to remain available for this sales order and its further future dispositions. In case of doubt, you should therefore answer \"NO\" here, i.e. leave the reserved quantities with this sales order. B. Change in quantity Double-clicking on the part request item opens the individual disposition. Among other things, the quantity of the part requirement item can be changed there. For this purpose the editing field must be activated with the button next to the quantity specification. The quantity change is also carried out in the exploded parts list (predecessor of the parts requirement item) when saving the individual planning run. If the part requirement item has several predecessors, the system tries to distribute the quantity to all predecessors. This can result in the quantity of a BOM item being set to 0 or being greatly increased. If it is not possible to split the new quantity, a corresponding error message is issued and the quantity change is not saved. C. Deletion of direct follow-on documents(production order, requirement request, warehouse reservation) When deleting direct follow-on documents, the respective identifiers within the part request must be deleted, otherwise direct follow-on documents can no longer be created for the affected items. To remove the identifier, there is the menu item Delete in the parts request under Edit. The various identifiers can be removed with the submenu items below. Main window: In this window, a parts request (gozintograph) is processed that has arisen from the production parts lists summarised according to production stages within the framework of parts scheduling. The type of display and further processing of the parts request can be controlled via the options. In the main menu the activities related to the whole part request are summarised, functionality related to single selected lines of the part request can be reached by using the buttons or the context menu (right mouse button on a line). Double-clicking on a list entry brings up the maintenance window for a single list entry, an individual scheduling. The column \"Work plan\" is used for a quick overview of whether there is anything to be considered regarding the work plans for production parts: If neither of the two cases applies to the parts requirement item, the column remains empty. Option window: Each time the part request window is opened, the options described here are reset to the default settings. Individual disposition: In this window a single entry of the entire part request is edited. Dispatching structure: In this view, for a part selected in the list view of the part request, the entire, dispositive structure of the (sub-)parts actually required for this part is displayed. As it is only known after the disposition which parts are actually required, this disposition structure can only be called up after the disposition. Optionally, you can only choose whether you want to display the parts \"without MRP\". Displayed are the part number, the description, the required quantity, the type of disposition and - in case of multiple use - also the number of parts in which the respective part is used. By double-clicking on an entry within the tree, you can go directly to the corresponding entry in the list view, where you can then also view any multiple use (in the higher-level parts). (If parts are not displayed in the list view, please check the display options). Cancellation of part requests: By cancelling a requirement trigger document (warehouse order, sales order, advance requirement), the parts requirement must also be cancelled so that the requirement no longer appears in the MRP account. When a part request is cancelled, all successors in the part request are also cancelled, e.g. in the case of production orders, all items belonging to them are cancelled. The following rules apply to cancellations, which are shown here schematically:. Calculation of the remaining quantity in the case of shortfalls in completed storage contracts: If a storage order item is marked as finished before the complete quantity has been put away, the remaining quantities are written into the slot cancelled.quantity, the status of the storage order item goes to \"put away\". To end a warehouse order item early, a partial quantity must be created via a posted goods receipt. Here, on the one hand, there is the possibility of reporting the warehouse order as finished with a short quantity by ticking \"Cancel remaining quantity\", on the other hand, there is the possibility of doing the same in the warehouse order item itself via the traffic light. If a partial quantity for a stock order item has been placed into storage and the traffic light is then changed from green to red, the stock order item is not stopped or cancelled, but marked as finished. In both cases, the system branches to a cancellation document. Only after posting this cancellation document is the remaining quantity cancelled and the order status changed to completed or cancelled. Also all Gozinto positions are adjusted and the remaining quantity is written into the slot cancelled.quantity. If several BOMs have been combined when creating the gozintograph, whereby only one BOM item is to be stopped, cancelled or reported finished, then the quantity of the item to be cancelled must be determined proportionately. The following graphic is helpful for this:. Subsequent conversion of the disposition type: If, for example, a part originally planned as an order part is to be converted to a production order after the parts requisition has been released, existing production orders, material withdrawals and purchase requisitions may change. For this reason, the conversion of a scheduled parts request item is not quite simple. First of all, it should be checked whether existing parts request items are changed/added by the changeover. This is done via the context menu of the list. - The entry to be changed over is marked in the parts request and the context menu is opened with the right mouse button. - A result window appears, which contains all newly added or existing changing parts request items. It shows the original and the newly determined quantity, as well as the statuses before and after the simulated changeover. In this way, it is possible to check in advance which further changes are to be expected: The tested position previously selected in the list appears as the topmost position as the entry object. If a previously \"sleeping\" part request item (old status \"Not required\") is now required,\"New part request item\" appears in the first column on the left. If the part requisition item already existed,\"Changed part requisition item\" appears here. If no existing parts requisition items with an MRP type material withdrawal, purchase requisition or production order have been changed, the item can be converted without hesitation. So in the example above you don't see any critical changes either, the only changed parts requirement items were and are set to \"No disposition\". The box\"Hide unneeded\" controls whether or not the \"sleeping\" part request positions that are not needed even after the simulated changeover are also displayed. However, if parts request items that have already been processed are changed, further quantity changes are necessary. This may require contacting the schedulers of existing purchase requisitions in order to adjust the quantity to be ordered and to coordinate the quantities and dates with the supplier. For production orders, existing production papers must be collected and reprinted. These scenarios are not yet implemented in ClassiX®, the changeover is aborted by an error message. - More about this later. If the disposition type is changed now, exactly the part requirements are created which were previously already visible in the preview window. At present, only a subsequent change from purchase requisition to production order is supported. Now, the new parts request items have not yet been scheduled, which must be done manually via graphic scheduling. Before that, the lead times of the new parts request items should be reset. This is currently done automatically when switching the disposition type. If the final dates are correct again after the adjustment, the project is updated via the menu \"Edit\"-\"Update project\" and the dates are written back. Overhangs and splitting: If a quantity of a standard MRP part is still available in a warehouse because, for example, the requirement of an original requirement trigger has been reduced or cancelled completely, this warehouse quantity (the so-called overhang quantity, see also \" Check material overhangs\" in the Gantt chart for part requirements) should be used up as quickly as possible. Overhangs can also occur when a part that was initially in stock is converted to \"dispositive\": any quantities still in stock at this time are then also treated as overhangs by the system. ClassiX® offers the functionality to consider surplus quantities already when creating the gozintograph. For this purpose, an option \"Automatically consume surplus quantities\" is available in all option windows for creating a gozintograph. If this option is set, an additional - initially still unposted - stock reallocation document is immediately created for each recognised surplus quantity when the MRP type is determined. This document serves as an identifier for the reservation of the surplus quantity for the order(s) processed in the gozintograph. The stock quantity is not actually reserved for the processed order(s) until the stock reset document is posted. This booking is triggered either manually by the user or by further processing of the gozintograph (e.g. by executing \"Create first purchase requisition\" in the case of excess quantities of purchase requisitions). The booking fails if another user has already used these surplus quantities while processing the gozintograph. If an excess quantity is recognised and booked for a production order, all - secondary - part requirements subordinate to this production order are automatically reduced by the corresponding quantity. If, for example, 1000 screws are needed for a production order of 100 pieces, but 20 pieces are withdrawn from stock as surplus quantity, the withdrawal quantity of the screws is automatically reduced to 800 pieces. The quantity of screws that is now no longer required (200 pieces) is marked as a cancelled quantity in the parts requisition item of the screws (during final posting, see above). If excess quantities are taken into account for parts requisition items (production order or purchase requisition), this has no effect on the scheduling (e.g. in the Gantt chart) of the corresponding parts requisition items: it is assumed that the respective excess quantity is available \"immediately\", the lead time of the parts requisition item is only based on the \"main MRP\", i.e. the lead time of the production or order part. This splitting (of parts dispositions) can not only take place automatically in the case of surplus quantities, but can also be triggered manually in the gozintograph via the menu selection \"secondary disposition\". For example, in the event of bottlenecks in production, a partial quantity can be ordered or, conversely, in the event of a supplier's delivery bottlenecks, a partial quantity can be produced by the supplier. In the latter case, however - due to secondary dispositions - the main disposition must be the production order, with the purchase requisition as secondary disposition. Which additional disposition can I create for which main disposition? To illustrate this, the following table: This table shows all types of ancillary planning. A few examples and an explanation are provided for clarification: In the left column you can read which main disposition type is on the part request item. In the columns to the right you can read off in the respective line which secondary MRP type can be created. It becomes clear that no auxiliary MRP \"production order\" can be created for any main MRP, only a purchase requisition and/or a stock reserve document can be created as auxiliary MRP. Since - as already explained above - the scheduling of a stock return document is irrelevant, only the secondary dispositions that are purchase requisitions (replenishment lead times) need to be taken into account additionally when scheduling a collective order. As can be seen from the table above, this only applies to the main disposition \"production order\" and \"material withdrawal\":. Rescheduling: See also calendar of operations A parts request that has already been started can be rescheduled in the same way as a parts request that has not yet been started. Please note that before any change is made, the approval of the parts request must be cancelled (set the traffic light to red)! To do this, select from the menu \"Edit - Scheduling - Graphic - Rescheduling\" or \"Edit - Scheduling - Graphic - Backward / forward scheduling\" and reschedule the part request. After scheduling, all follow-on documents that may exist for the individual part request items must be checked to see if the dates still fit, because during rescheduling, the dates of the follow-on documents (production order / requirement request) are not automatically adjusted. In order to know which parts requirement items have changed after rescheduling, a list is opened after \"Update project\" in the graphical scheduling, which shows all changed parts requirement items. This window can also be opened again at any time after closing it via the menu item\"Edit - Check - Changed dates\". If the dates are now to be transferred to the subsequent documents, select the respective entry from the list and open the context menu with the right mouse button. Here there is the entry \"Copy appointments to follow-on documents\". The latest end of the part request item is taken over as date for the follow-on documents. Please note that the work sequences are only adjusted to the end date (the work sequences are postponed by the same number of working days as the end date of the part request has been postponed)! If the duration of a production order has been changed via graphic scheduling, the routing is not automatically extended as well! This must be done manually afterwards! (The system cannot know which work sequence now takes longer or which work sequence has been added!) Material withdrawals whose dates have changed are ignored when the list of changed dates is reopened. Material withdrawals do not have a follow-on document and therefore do not need to be handled separately. When this list is opened automatically for the first time, directly after rescheduling from the graphical view, these material withdrawals appear additionally in the list, since at this point in time all changed part requisition dates are generally displayed here. Changing the processing time: With this dialogue it is possible to increase the total cycle time for the gozintograph and to distribute this as a percentage to the cycle times of the parts on the individual positions of the gozintograph. However, the lead times of individual work sequences of the production orders do not change, only the earliest start date and finish date are changed. This gives the individual cost centres/workstations more time to process the order and can thus avoid peaks. Self-provision: If, for example, a \"brick lining\" service is ordered from a supplier, in which this supplier is to install something in a finished assembly (brick lining), the assembly must be built to schedule before the brick lining is ordered. So from the parts list it must look like this: Order part \"brick lining\" has the following parts list entries in its production role: Sub-assembly A must be provided to the supplier in order to enable the supplier to perform the ordered service. Sub-assembly B is provided by the supplier himself. In the parts request, there is therefore the brick lining with the procurement type \"purchase requisition\". Now, however, a production order must be created below this purchase requisition so that the assembly is executed before the brickwork is ordered: There are two ways to do this: For information on the further course of the self-provision, see here. List window: Serves to list or search for part requirements (Gozintographs). All transaction types that exist in the ClassiX® system can be dragged into the list with the mouse. If there is a follow-up parts requisition for the item dragged into the list, or for one of its sub-items, these are displayed in the list. Selection window: This window is used to select part requests (Gozintographs). Automatic scheduling: The automatic scheduling offers the possibility to schedule the entire part requirement either from a start date forward or from an end date backward fully automatically. This type of scheduling simulates the resulting work sequences, if they have not already been resolved, and plans them into the actual utilisation of resources to identify bottlenecks. Furthermore, in the automatic scheduling window it can be checked whether parts are/will be available on the specified date. Bottlenecks (material or capacity) are pointed out, or they are automatically bypassed by scheduling shifts. It is also possible to clear up the remaining bottlenecks later in the manual graphical scheduling. There are two possibilities to circumvent the bottlenecks, or workplace-specific holidays or insufficient capacity: The set scheduling options are saved on the part request item (seamless scheduling and avoid bottlenecks). If another work sequence is subsequently inserted into a production order, it is scheduled with the same settings as the entire parts requirement before it. Note: The operating calendars of the individual workstations or production areas are taken into account for scheduling. For example, it is possible to schedule the welding shop fully in the first calendar week of the year, with all other production areas being free at this time. After automatic scheduling, a message will appear to indicate whether the planned delivery date could be met, and information on capacity and material bottlenecks will also appear in the list in the scheduling window. More about rescheduling and the general scheduling of the necessary provision of parts. Required capacity: This window provides an overview of all required workstation resources in the respective calendar weeks. Even if routings or production orders have not yet been exploded, the system simulates the requirements and adds them to the actual current requirements. preConstraints-postConstraints Connections of the part requirement items to each other: The connection in a part request of the positions among each other still below (to dispose before me) and above (will be produced with me after me) is done by the connection preConstraints (before me) and postConstraints (after me). This connection makes it very easy to determine for which part requirement item a different part requirement item is needed. No need to go through the complicated BOM predecessor item. If a part requirement item is to be cancelled, all part requirement items to be scheduled before this item must also be adjusted in the correct quantity ratio (or cancelled if cancelled item is the only predecessor) - these can now be determined very easily. If a part is required at several points in the parts list across several production levels, it always appears at the lowest level in the parts request, since these are planned first (it is double-wired by postConstraints!). Example: A blower to be manufactured in-house is to be installed in a switch cabinet. M6 screws are required for both the control cabinet and the blower (they are present in both parts lists). So the parts lists look like this: Switch cabinet: blower: A total of 70 M6 screws are therefore required. In the part request, identical parts are grouped together (e.g. so that the same production order is not created 3 times for the same part). Therefore it is now necessary to procure the screws in their entire quantity at the earliest required date, i.e. at the time the fan is manufactured. The part request item appears with the highest required level and will be scheduled as early as possible. Technically, the parts requirement position of the M6 screw is now connected to 2 postConstraints, namely that of the blower and that of the control cabinet. If the blower is now cancelled via the parts list, the parts requirement position of the screws is reduced in quantity and moved directly below the level of the control cabinet.

The window title shows who the displayed transactions originate from.

When creating transaction documents, this information controls whether the transaction folder of the company or the company role is placed in the transaction document in addition to the transaction folder of the contact person. Transactions primarily include transactions that are automatically posted to the transaction folder of the corresponding business object. This is done according to the transaction description of the individual document types, such as invoices, orders, etc. Subfolders (period, status, etc.) are also automatically created in which the documents are filed. In this way, a structure is created, as can be seen on the right-hand side, for example. (The number in brackets indicates how many receipts are in the corresponding folder.){img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"526\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}Furthermore, there are so-called transaction documents that are manually posted in transaction folders. These include letters, faxes and e-mails, but also simple notes or visit logs.

Thus, in addition to the transactions, documents and cost objects can also be displayed and partially maintained here. General functionality of the Tasks folder: The folder is divided into two parts. On the left side the tasks/task folders are shown in the tree structure. The task documents can be displayed or not displayed here in the tree structure by option. Independently of the options the tasks of the selected folder are displayed on the right side.

System folder/\"normal\" folders The colour of the folder shows whether it was created automatically or manually. The folders shown in red are the automatically created system folders that were created by posting a transaction based on a transaction description. Transaction documents in these folders can neither be moved nor removed and it is also not possible to insert other transaction documents or \"simple\" folders here. Folders shown in yellow are manually created folders. The user is free to edit these folders. Display of the transaction documents in the list The presentation of the transaction documents in the list can vary from folder to folder. For example, there is a standard format for the list if there are only transaction documents (letter, fax, etc.) in a folder. If a folder consists of subfolders (and transactions), the system switches to a general format. If a system folder has no subfolders but only transactions, the system tries to determine the list format automatically from the status monitor or workflow of the corresponding document type.

Selection window: This window is used to select a production data acquisition. BDE time ticket recording: individual slip: This window is used to enter feedback data from the production plant. Via the menu you can also reach a special window for direct scanning of any barcode printed on the work slip. Attention: External work sequences should be finalised via the procurement process (external work sequence - purchase order - goods receipt - quality assurance). However, it is also possible to finalise these notes directly via the PDC recording, but then no costs of the external production run into the order post-calculation. An incoming invoice cannot be created for the external work sequence either. If the selected work sequence is an external work sequence, the question arises as to whether you really want to report it completed via the normal individual slip. BDE time ticket recording: Collected slips: If several entries are selected in the list of worklists, an adapted collective window with a list of all selected entries appears when the menu item \"Production data acquisition (SFDC) - Confirmation time\" is selected from the context menu. If the selected entries do not have the same resource, it must be selected manually. Via the collective list, it is possible to record several work sequences at once or to report them as finished. In each of the selected work sequences, the total time (over all work sequences), weighted according to the remaining time, is entered as actual time. If the remaining time of the selected work sequences is already zero, the weighting is carried out according to the target time. If even the total target time over all selected work sequences is zero, the reported total time is distributed evenly over the selected work sequences. With this type of recording it is not possible to record (partial) quantities (yield) manually. In case of a finished message the respective quantity of the production order item is automatically transferred (see field description \"finished\"). Attention: External work sequences should be finalised via the procurement process (external work sequence - order - goods receipt - quality assurance). However, it is also possible to report these notes ready directly via the PDC status change, but then no costs of external production are included in the order post calculation. An incoming invoice cannot be created for the external work sequence either. If one of the selected work sequences is an external work sequence, the question is asked whether one really wants to change these items via this route.

It enables total times for individual order items to be confirmed in total. This is useful, for example, for notifications from final assembly, where you do not want to confirm every single work ticket, but all times in one for one order item at one workstation. In the lower part of the window, the order items for which you want to perform the collective time message are displayed. BDE status change: This window is used to enter feedback data from the production plant. Via the menu you can also reach a special window for direct scanning of any barcode printed on the work slip. Attention: External work sequences should be reported completed via the procurement process (external work sequence - purchase order - goods receipt - quality assurance). However, it is also possible to report these slips completed directly via the PDC status change, but then no costs of the external production run into the order post-calculation. An incoming invoice can then also not be created for the external work sequence. If one of the selected work sequences is an external work sequence, the question is asked whether you really want to change the status of these items via this route. If \"Cancel\" is selected, only the \"non-external\" work sequences are changed, the external ones remain untouched. Module name: prodcapt.mod. Classes: CX_PRODUCTION_DATA_CAPTURE.

Consequently, reports can and are created from these lists. A report is - according to the ClassiX terminology - a list prepared with a design tool, the lists always represent the data basis for reports.It is therefore best to create a new report from the reporting window that has already been called up with the data of a list. Only in this case, i.e. if data (from a list) is already available, can you open the Designer report. If you do not have a current list window with data, however, you can also build on an already existing XML file.Alternatively, you may have opened the Report window because you want to edit an existing report. You can then, for example, change the name and/or the description or edit the layout of the report with the report design tool.Another way to create reports is to use the Data Query Wizard. Input window: This window is used to maintain reports. The Report tab in the input window contains some general information about a report. These can also be edited at this point and are saved by clicking on the save symbol or the OK button. If you create a new report, you should give the report a name in the Report name field and enter a more detailed description if necessary. The category in the ClassiX® system determines which reports belong to which list / list window. This should therefore be selected carefully. A special feature is that there are two buttons in the toolbar of this input window to start the report designer. The button Reporttool-Designer can always be used if data is already known, e.g. if this input window was called up from the Reporting window. The other possibility to start the Designer without having come out of the reporting window - i.e. no data is known - is the button Reporttool-Designer, load from file. You will be asked for an XML file. Defined number ranges: The numbers for the reports should be divided into categories:. List window: This window is for listing reports. Selection window: This window is used to select a report. Selection window for report execution (Automatic report execution): This window is used to select a report to be executed. Import and export: In order to make general changes to reports in a history manageable and to make changes to standard forms available to all ClassiX customers at once, there is the possibility to export reports into a text file or to import them from it. The resulting file name is composed as follows: If the \"Customer derivation\" indicator was set, the file is not exported directly to the standard report directory, but to a subdirectory with the customer abbreviation. If an attempt is made to import a standard form for which there is a customer derivation, the machine reports an error and terminates. It is therefore not possible to overwrite the customer derivation with a standard form. To ensure that there are no problems with encoding tables when importing and exporting, the rule was introduced that the short name and the module name must not contain any umlauts, spaces or special characters. This will be checked when saving and the report will not be saved if it does not comply with this rule. Composition of the file name of a report: The following widgets are attracted for the filename: Context, Report Name and Custom Report. The contents of the Context and Report Name widgets are linked with the \"-\" character and the Custom Report checkbox controls whether \"_\" is appended to the filename with a client abbreviation before ending in \".rptdesign\".

Other business objects can also hold an account of the type \"storage bin\", e.g. forklift trucks for the short-term storage of goods. It is not possible to make a stock entry (entry, removal, transfer) without having defined at least one warehouse with at least one storage bin beforehand. A warehouse can have any number of storage bins, a storage bin is always assigned to only one warehouse. Storage bins typically have a bin \"number\" which is or should be exactly the same as the identification of a particular storage bin in the physical warehouse. In addition to information on location, size and capacity calculation, storage bins can be assigned to various sort keys, for example, to assign the storage bin to a storage type, storage section, picking area, staging area, door, or transfer zone, etc. Once the evaluation groups have been assigned, characteristics can be added to them in order to optimally control the warehouse management. In the standard system, the term \"picking zone\" (also often referred to as storage area) is predefined as a classification term for a storage bin with identifier \"PICKING_ZONE\". Sub-terms for freely definable picking areas are: Fast-moving items, Slow-moving items, etc.The term \"perpetual inventory\" is also predefined in the standard system as a classification term with the identifier \"CONTINOUS_STOCKTAKING\". Within this order structure, the storage bins are divided into individual subgroups for which inventories are then carried out one after the other in the course of a year. In this way, an inventory plan is defined for all storage bins, which ensures that each storage bin is counted at least once within a business year. The warehouse assigned to a storage bin can also be assigned to sort keys (see sort key \"STORAGE_TYPE\" for storage types), it is up to the internal organisation to find an optimal structure of the data for the company. Storage locations can be assigned to a topography of a warehouse in order to optimise paths in the warehouse. It is recommended that the storage locations are specified for aisle/rack/compartment (see utility Split storage location numbers into aisle/rack/compartment, which can be called up from the menu of the list window) and their X, Y and Z coordinates are set (see utility Import X, Y and Z coordinates of storage locations, which can be called up from the menu of the list window).

Test storage and retrieval machine (SRM): In this window a TCP/IP connection to a storage and retrieval machine (SRM) can be established and a command can be issued to the SRM. After the command has been given, a response is expected (in standard). Herewith it can be tested if a transport order is processed correctly. List window: Serves to list the storage locations. A storage bin can be assigned to each storage part, which is then displayed in the list 'Storage bins in the warehouse.'.

        "output": "Keywords: The central element in the structuring or classification of master data are classification terms, which can also be called structures. With this app, you can visually structure (order) any business objects such as parts (into parts classes), articles (into statistics groups), customers (into sales areas) or financial accounting accounts (into balance sheet and P&L frames). All business objects can be assigned to any classification terms as often as desired. As an example a simple classification for parts according to part classes is shown here: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"450\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}Once such a structure tree has been defined, any business objects can be assigned to a \"branch\" or \"structure node\" by \"drag & drop\". Business objects can also be assigned several times to different \"branches/nodes\" of the same tree.Order terms can and should also be used for temporary actions: e.g. the compilation of different customers into mailing campaigns. Objects namely, which are ordered in a branch/node, can conversely now be inserted as a complete group into other applications by \"drag&drop\". For example, individual customer groups can be assigned to a transaction document with a specific cover letter in one and processed as a form letter. The structuring is done by assigning the master data to individual nodes in the structure tree, so in the example individual customer types are assigned to the customers. The classification terms can now in turn be assigned properties, so a customer group can be assigned to each customer type. (In the example of the customer group, conditions (discounts, surcharges, warranties, ) can be assigned to a group of customers.). Structuring and categorisation of data: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"452\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Further examples: - Article groups -> Sales statistics groups: Definition of cost type and article group discounts - Vendor type -> vendor group: definition of vendor conditions. Automatic structuring of data: The typical structuring of data is done via the classification terms and their structure accounts. The assignment of the - usually - master data is done manually via the respective editing mask of the master data or by assignment via drag&drop via the tree display of the classification term. Structure status accounts can also be used for automatic structuring. In this case, the structure status nodes of the evaluation group are provided with a transition condition as they are also used in the business processes. Through this, the structure node is determined automatically if the structured master data objects change. Input window Order key: This window is used to maintain keywords. You can select an evaluation group by double-clicking on the desired evaluation group in the list window or by pressing the \"Edit\" button. From the input window, the list window can be opened with the menu item \"Search\". In order to insert business objects into the structure of a created classification key, they are simply dragged from another window, e.g. \"Cost types\" or \"Articles\", to the desired position in the structure using drag&drop. To insert a sub-folder or to edit it and the underlying structure, select the corresponding sub-folder and choose the item \"Sub-folder\" from the \"Edit\" menu (you can also get this functionality by right-clicking on a sub-folder): you can choose between inserting a new sub-folder below the selected item or deleting the selected sub-folder or removing one in the business object from a sub-folder. With very large structure trees it is often very tedious to move subfolders within the tree. Therefore, by selecting \"Move subfolders\" in a new window you can directly select the position to which the selected subfolder should be moved. With \"Expand subfolders\" a subfolder is also deleted from the structure tree, but the contents of this subfolder (together with any other subfolders) are moved to the next higher node. Remark: The menu for editing \"subfolders\" can also be obtained by right-clicking on the node to be edited. Subfolder (default) input window: This window is used to maintain the subfolders (branches/nodes) of a classification term. Certain order terms (e.g. \"CONTINOUS_STOCKTAKING\" for dividing storage bins for permanent inventory) can have their own window definitions (see here). Subfolder input window (perpetual inventory): This window is used to maintain the subfolders (branches/nodes) of the special order term (\"CONTINOUS_STOCKTAKING\") for dividing storage bins for perpetual inventory.

These resubmissions can then be called up via the \"My resubmissions\" list and checked by interval. Both activity and planning can be active or passive. Active transactions are outgoing from the own company to a partner. Passive transactions are incoming from an external partner to one's own company (e.g. customer calls me, customer writes an e-mail to me, etc.). Activity or planning can be marked as \"completed\" to track processing.One or more recipients can be assigned to an activity note.

Depending on what is selected as the type of transaction (letter, fax, e-mail, etc.), the corresponding contact information is output next to the name of the recipient, i.e. address, fax number or e-mail address. This means that transaction notes can also be used, for example, to create serial letters. These can be changed via the context menu on the corresponding line. Any number of transaction notes can be assigned to all business objects - organised via transaction folders. A business object can be, for example, a partner, a partner function (e.g. supplier), a part, a part function (e.g. the production function), a parts list, etc. or even another document, such as an order, an invoice or another transaction note. On the other hand, each operation note itself can be linked to any number of business objects. The transaction notes are then posted in these transaction folders and thus support the workflow of information. Transaction notes can also be created directly from a business object by specifying the transaction type (note, letter, telephone call, etc.). If the transaction type is letter, fax or e-mail, the business object (the partner or partner function) is automatically entered as the recipient, otherwise only its transaction folder is automatically registered in the transaction note.If the business object is a contact person, the transaction folder of the contact person's company or the company function from which the contact person was called is also inserted next to the transaction folder of the contact person.With transaction notes, customer contact management in the sense of CRM functionality is possible: storage of information about e.g. telephone calls, correspondence and e-mail communication with the customer(activities), or planning with usually a resubmission, e.g. to promote marketing/sales campaigns.Any number of external documents can be added to a transaction note.

To show on each page whether external documents have been added to a transaction note, their number appears directly on the corresponding tab. The list shows both the type of file and the application registered for this type. For security reasons, the documents added here are assigned directly to the transaction note and are not maintained as associations within the document history.Furthermore, a description can be entered for each external document (via the 'Description' button). As a last piece of information, the file name under which the file was/is stored on the hard disk is also entered. All attached files are sent as attachments when they are sent by e-mail. The processing of all Microsoft Office file types is guaranteed by default.In order to create document chains (for one and the same activity/planning), follow-up documents can also be created from an activity note. These are used, for example, to track the customer contact regarding a topic, e.g. first telephone call - info mail sent - second telephone call - presentation - third telephone call, etc. The links between a transaction note and its predecessor or successor documents are displayed in the document links tab.Each transaction note is assigned to a business process and can assume different statuses, which are controlled manually. New business processes can be created for the transaction notes at any time. The indicator of the new business process must start with \"TXN_NOTE_WFL\" to be recognised as a transaction note process.The field\"Processor\" identifies the employee or cost centre who must complete this \"task\" or in whose processes and possibly resubmissions this activity note is posted.You can find information on printing task notes here. Input window: This window is used to maintain transaction notes. You can select an operation note by entering the number of the desired operation note in the \"Number\" field and confirming with RETURN. When creating an activity note, the date, time, type, creator and editor (from the logged-in user) and - if not specified otherwise - the activity folder of the user - are predefined. If a recipient is selected, the process is also registered in the recipient's process folder. The process note number is automatically assigned after saving the process note. The text field (\"Message\" field) of the receipt can also be entered in Word format. This happens automatically when you create the document as a letter or fax (\"Transaction type\" field, but only if transaction type is \"active\") or when you call up the menu item manually (Edit -> Format -> MS-Word). Saved transaction notes can be copied or a follow-up document can be created:. Serial letters or circulars with personal cover letters: A transaction note can be used as a form letter or circular mail if several recipients are inserted in the recipient tab. In this way you can, for example, invite people to a trade fair or carry out comparable marketing campaigns. Now you want to address each addressee personally in your circular. A standard \"Dear Sir or Madam\" letter is not enough for you. You can implement this using document variables, which can be used depending on the cover letter type (Word or text). In Word, the variables are inserted in the way described here. If the message is entered as text, the access expression within the text must be enclosed by the following character string: \"This is the text before the variable << access expression >> This is the text after the variable.\" In some cases, the access expression does not return a result. In order to still return a standard text in these cases, you can add two \"OR characters\" with the alternative text within the access expression. In the following example, the contact person of a transaction note is to be addressed personally. If this person is not known, a standard form of address is to be used:. Emails with Cc/Bcc recipients and circulars: Transaction notes can be of the type \"email\" on the one hand and of the type \"circular email\" on the other. In the case of an \"email\", exactly one email is sent. All selected recipients are set as recipients of this one email. The recipients can also be set to the type \"Cc\" or \"Bcc\". To do this, proceed as follows: However, it is also possible - as described in the previous section - to send circular e-mails. In this case, not one e-mail is sent to all recipients, but one e-mail per recipient, ideally even with an individual cover letter. To do this, select the type \"E-mail (circular)\". If one or more recipients have been set to the type \"Cc\" or \"Bcc\", these recipients will not receive the e-mail directly as the main recipient, but will receive a copy or blind copy of all e-mails. List window: The list window is used to list operation notes. The list can be filtered through the upper search fields. The filter can consist of several fields at the same time. However, if the \"number\" is searched for, all other fields are reset (since the number of an operation note is always unique). Any entry in another field resets the \"number\" field. The window title always shows from which basic set or from which folder the displayed operation notes originate: e.g. \"All operation notes\" if listed from the set of all operation notes or \"Operation notes from.\" if it is about operation notes of e.g. a user or \"Operation notes in.\" if the operation notes originate from a subfolder. The display \"Inserted operation notes\" appears if the operation notes were taken over into the list by dragging and dropping other objects. The following objects can be dragged into the list by drag&drop: The additional display \"( filtered )\" appears if a value was entered in the search mask and the list is thus filtered according to these criteria. Double-clicking on an entry in the list or selecting an entry in the list and then pressing the \"Edit\" button in the input window opens the input mask for editing the activity note. Options window: In the options window, a default process and a default status can be defined, which are automatically set when a new operation note is created. Resubmission of operations (actions): The resubmission serves as a reminder to the user of transaction notes by means of a pop-up window. This window displays all task notes that are of the type \"action\", have a resubmission date in the past and are not marked as completed. The task notes are assigned to a user via the task folders. It is therefore also possible to have a resubmission document pop up for another user. This can be done by selecting another user in the group \"To task folder of\" via the insert menu. By default, the resubmission option is switched off. This is defined in the user in the\"Messages\" tab. There you can also define that the settings are inherited from higher-level cost centres or the client.

        "output": "Process routes: Business processes describe the flow of a single document by means of status (monitors). However, since the status of a document can be dependent on the status of another document, it must be possible to link several business processes of different documents with each other in order to map the complete process chain. This run through different business processes is called a process route.A simple example of this is the process route of a production part to be manufactured for an order:Before production, the order item runs from status \"created\" to status \"bill of material released\". If a production order - as a new document of another business process - with the status \"created\" is now created from this status, the order item itself is switched to the next status \"production order\" (PRODUCTION_ORDER). The order item remains in this status until the production order has reached the status \"provided\". Only then does the status of the order item change to \"ready\": Production\" (PRODUCTION_PROVISION).Such concatenations are possible within the transition descriptions in the individual status monitors, in the following figure using the example of the transition from the initial state \"Production order\" (PRODUCTION_ORDER) to the subsequent state \"Ready: Production\" (PRODUCTION_PROVISION): The process route to which this transition belongs is selected via the \"Process routes\" button. Then, by double-clicking on the newly assigned process route, the detailed processing of this assignment can be carried out. In this detail editing, a description can now be entered, e.g. which follow-on documents are necessary or similar. The possible start statuses of the follow-on documents can now be inserted into the list \"Follow-on monitors\" by clicking the \"Insert\" button. It is also possible to drag and drop the successor status directly into the list.Some data that the system cannot automatically find out must then be added: On the one hand, the class of the follow-on document must be specified (in this example CX_PRODUCTION_ORDER for a production order), and on the other hand, the process name must be entered. The process name is the name with which a document is linked to a business process and which is then specified for switching (triggering) a status monitor (e.g. here: productionOrderItem Get(TriggeredStateMonitor(\"PRODUCTION\")).The fields in the \"Origin\" group are empty when first opened and later only serve for navigation: in which transition is this dependency and to which process route is it assigned there.Once all these dependencies have been maintained, a view of the business processes through which the process route passes can be created afterwards. To the right is an example of the extent to which a document (order item) has already run through this process route. With the help of this graphic, it is now possible to see which steps still have to be carried out before the order item can be set to the status \"Ready: Production\" status.

For example, an industrial employee may not clock in outside the working time assigned to him, although an employee may.The recording of sick days can also vary: If an employee is only paid by the hour, he or she does not receive a wage for this period. However, if he is an employee, the day is paid.These rules are laid down in the flexitime rules.Technical description:The floating time events write certain bit patterns into the evaluation. These bit patterns are evaluated by these rules and an action number is generated. This action number is then translated into various reactions in the programme code.The possible reactions of the system are the following:Overtime before or after working hours: Recorded time is outside working hours. If it is earlier than normal working time, it is only counted at weekends; on weekdays a message appears. If it is overtime after the end of working time, it is always counted, but on working days an additional notification message is displayed.Recorded working time is within the normal flexitime and is counted as normal working time. (e.g. employee has come within the flexitime but outside the standard working time)Recorded absence lies within the core working time. Only one warning message is issuedRecorded time is normal working time and is also counted as such (like point 2, only within working time instead of flexitime!) (e.g. employee came during working time but outside of break)DiseaseHolidayOn business trips (working time will be credited as normal)Present during a break (working time is NOT counted)Fixed working time (reaction still unclear)Overtime before or after working hours: Recorded time is outside working hours. If it is earlier than normal working time, it is only counted at weekends; on weekdays a message appears. If it is overtime after the end of working time, it is always counted, but in contrast to point 1, an additional message is always displayedPensioners and cleaning staff: working time is always fully countedAdditional days off.Additional planning functionality of the rulesSince the flexitime rules assume that a working time has already been recorded, without a pure planning rule it is not possible to determine in advance how much working time an employee will have to work on Wednesday of the following week. There is an extra rule for this which assumes that no time records have yet been made and only assumes the planned time.This rule can either be specified directly on the employee if he does not stamp, i.e. has fixed working times, or on another rule as a \"capacity planning rule\".When determining the planned working time, the planning rule is always used if it has been specified. If this link is missing, 0min remaining available capacity is used in planning.Technical description of the evaluationFirst, the evaluation takes the time period to be evaluated and runs through all days individually.For each day, all booked receipts per employee are first collected and the recorded events \"coming\" (firstComingTime) and \"going\" (lastGoingTime) are stored in a dailyContainer.The posted events are run through together with the working time events and the action of the latter is always carried out, whereby an action as described above is then determined via the rule.Example In this example, you can see how the working times behave mixed with the posted receipts. The employee has booked an \"Arrives\" and a \"Leaves\" receipt. The remaining entries are events from the master data of the working time description. The action is the result of the rule determined from the bit patterns above. Input window: This window is used to maintain flexitime rules.

        "output": "Delivery note: In this module, delivery notes can be recorded and further processed.Instructions for printing delivery notes can be found here. Creation of delivery notes: Delivery notes can be created for order items, incoming goods, stock removal and stock orders. To create a delivery note for one of these predecessors, open a new delivery note, save it, switch to the \"Items\" tab and drag the predecessors into the list. A delivery note item is immediately created for all predecessors. Here the part and the quantity are automatically taken over. It is also possible to create a free delivery note item. To do this, press the \"Create\" button in the \"Positions\" tab and select the menu item \"Delivery note position\". Now you have the possibility to create all data freely, like quantity, part and predecessor. All the above-mentioned previous documents can now be dragged back into the previous field. If no quantity has been entered or no part has been selected, the data of the predecessor are taken over. If data has already been entered, it will not be overwritten. Control of recipient / conditions: A delivery note can only be (automatically) extended if the recipient set in the delivery note header matches that of the order. Please note that order groups can also have a different recipient. If the latter is the case, the group can only be drawn into a delivery note individually. In order to prevent errors/discrepancies, the delivery notes are not automatically divided in the above case. Since the delivery conditions can also differ on the order groups, the same rule applies here as for the recipient. Each delivery condition can only be used once per delivery note, otherwise an error is reported. If an order group has a condition that has not yet been used in the delivery note header, this condition is copied into the delivery note. Types of delivery notes: There are basically 2 different types of delivery notes: The head type depends on the delivery note item types. So if a delivery note only consists of service items, the delivery note becomes the delivery confirmation. If there is a part in between, it remains an ordinary delivery note. A delivery confirmation assumes other conditions than a delivery note. The delivery confirmation first enters the status \"In Acceptance\" and is \"completed\" by manual intervention. The print forms differ here between \"In acceptance\" and \"Accepted\". It is also possible to book the delivery note as a removal from stock, if the corresponding option \"direct delivery\" is set and the part of the delivery note item is kept in stock. In this case, the delivery note also provides the order quantity so that no further stock removal needs to be created. Business process of delivery notes: How the delivery note fits into the overall shipping process can be found here , a description of the delivery process can be seen here. To describe the processing status of the delivery note there are three relevant states. Subsequent deliveries: Delivery notes can also be used for internal subsequent deliveries: Example: If, for example, an order item has been delivered completely, but a subpart of this order item is broken on the construction site through the fault of the company's own employees and is to be delivered subsequently, a retrieval can simply be created with the order item as the predecessor and then a delivery note can be created for this retrieval and the goods sent afterwards. If a delivery note has been created for an entire order group and after a while it is discovered that parts belonging to this order group were inadvertently not sent after all, another delivery note can be created for these straggler items. This will then no longer change the delivery status of the order item. For this purpose, a new delivery note must be created and the order item must be dragged directly into this delivery note again or selected. A query is made as to whether the item, which has obviously already been completely delivered, should nevertheless be included in the delivery note. If this question is answered with YES, such a subsequent delivery note is created. This subsequent delivery note is placed at the end of the preceding delivery note in the document chain, i.e. it is not directly attached to the order item but to the preceding delivery note. Delivery note as removal from storage: If a delivery note was created as a direct successor of an interim storage document, it also serves to remove the temporarily stored quantity from the interim storage again. In these cases the delivery note even appears in the warehouse statistics. It is also possible to book the delivery note as a removal from storage. If this option \"direct stock removal\" is set on the delivery note header under the area \"Conditions\", the system checks for each new delivery note item whether the part of the delivery note that has been resolved from the attributes is stock managed and, in the case of an existing order item as predecessor, whether the disposition status is \"stock reservation\". If so, the check mark \"Direct removal from stock\" is also set on the delivery note item and the stock level is adjusted when the delivery note is posted. The delivery note also increases the staged quantity of the order and is posted in the final costing. In the final costing, a delivery note is valued like a removal from stock. In this case, the delivery note also provides the order quantity so that no further stock removal needs to be created. For more information on interim storage, see its module description. List window: Serves to list the delivery notes. Selection window: This window is used to select a delivery note. Document presets: This window is for setting the document settings for delivery notes. The document settings can be assigned to a user, a cost center, a client, or a partner function, for example.

        "output": "Disposable assembly: With this module, the complete structure of a parts list - i.e. including the structures of all subordinate assemblies - can be changed in a production part role in order to better reflect the actual manufacturing process of the part in production. In design, assemblies are often only formed from a purely functional point of view, i.e. a \"constructive\" product structure is created which does not correspond to the \"dispositive\" product structure. Such deviations between the \"constructive\" and \"dispositive\" view of a bill of material can occur when a bill of material individual items within a subordinate assembly of this parts list are not first pre-assembled to this assembly in the production process, but are built directly into the higher-level assembly in one go(constructive assembly), individual items of the same level do not flow simultaneously, but at different times into different, higher-level(MRP-extended) assemblies (e.g. in the case of subordinate, individually loose parts that must first be provided for final assembly), or individual items are only prefabricated as sub-assemblies - not provided for by the design -(purely disposable assemblies). So if an assembly is declared as a so-called\"constructive assembly\" on the production part, this level is completely omitted in the MRP view of each higher-level assembly of this production part. If a \"dispositive assembly\" is declared on the production part, then items from different, subordinate assemblies can be \"shifted dispositively (up)\" into this assembly, i.e. the vertical range of manufacture of these items can be reduced. Finally, by defining a\"purely dispositive assembly\", individual items from any structure depth of the parts list can be combined to form a new part, a new assembly. The constructive product structure of a production part, which is built up from the point of view of design, can therefore differ considerably from the production-oriented dispositive product structure of the same production part, which also changes the structure of the part requirement. The restructuring of a product structure from the constructive to the dispositive type is defined on the basis of dispositive assembly objects which are added to a production role of a part. Input window: An MRP assembly always refers to the production part whose MRP product structure is to be changed. If the production part itself does not have its own bill of material, i.e. if it is a purely MRP assembly, a bill of material can be freely specified, otherwise the specifications for the bill of material of the production part apply. With the button the constructive, with the button the dispositive product structure can be called up. If a production roll has a bill of material and if the MRP assembly contains an entry for a part from a subordinate assembly of this bill of material, this part is \"pushed\" below this production part when the production bill of material is exploded (reduction of the vertical range of manufacture) - according to the new MRP product structure. This also applies to purely MRP assemblies, the only difference is that in this case the production part itself does not have a bill of material, but this is specified in the purely MRP assembly itself (reduction or increase of the vertical range of manufacture). This purely MRP entry is then visible both in the initial production role (the freely selected parts list) and in the production role of the intermediate part, the purely MRP assembly. Fields. Available product structure: The MRP product structure shows how the bill of material is later processed in production, or how the parts are planned or installed. The dispositive product structure of the parts list is displayed as a tree. The button in the upper left corner allows you to call up the constructive product structure.

After entering their own VAT registration number and the VAT registration number of the foreign customer to be confirmed, the information is compared with the database of the respective tax authority of the foreign customer. the sums of the tax bases of intra-Community processing operations for each contracting authority whether the transaction is a supply, a service or a triangular transaction The following should be noted in order to carry out the ZM electronically. The data of the form can be filled in directly via an import of the data previously exported with this module. The ZM declaration can be called up for individual accounts or for structure nodes of a classification term populated with accounts. Note: Before using this module, it is advisable to classify the revenue accounts according to delivery or service accounts. Classify accounts: In order to be able to automatically allocate transactions as goods or services, it is advisable to mark the revenue accounts concerned in advance as accounts for goods or services. The marking is done via the attribute \"delivery or service\" (deliveryOrServiceEnum), which can be stored in the system in various ways:. List window: From this window you can call up the recapitulative statement. Essentially, the time period and the corresponding intra-Community profit and loss account/revenue account must be specified. You can also select a structure node of an evaluation group. The accounts assigned under this structure node are included together in the evaluation. If there are entries in this selected P&L account/revenue account in the selected period that do not have a subledger account as a contra account, these are listed as differences in the differences window after the list has been built up. The totals are displayed below the list. The first line of the totals fields is the summation of the entries in the list. The second line of totals contains the values of the selected account(s). The balance value of the list entries must match the balance value of the selected account(s), otherwise the difference is output in the field below, which should then match the entry in the difference window. Depending on the call-up type of the list, the context menu (right mouse button) is different: Context menu for cumulated list Context menu for individual listing of account postings Double-clicking on a list entry opens the editing window of a booking. Editing window: In this window, individual bookings can be edited with a view to their processing within the recapitulative statement. Differences window: In this window, the P&L account/revenue account postings are displayed that have no counterpart account for any person. The difference displayed in the window header is the sum of the difference values of all list entries. This sum should be equal to the total difference of the account balances in the list window. Double-clicking on a list entry displays the complete booking document in the journal. Right-clicking opens the navigation menu context sensitive. Implementation: All open item postings (CX_OPEN_ITEM_TXN) belonging to the selected account and posting periods are added together. Module name: ecvatsta.mod. Classes: CX_TRANSACTION."

Keyboard Operation: You can make the entire booking using the keyboard - i.e. without using the mouse. Either use the 'Tab' key to move forward from field to field, or the 'Shift' and 'Tab' keys to move backward from field to field, or use the 'Enter' key on the numeric keyboard (right-hand side of the keyboard). When you reach buttons, they are triggered with the Return or Select key (2nd key to the right of \"Ä\"); the Enter key is used to exit the button without action. In selection fields (drop-down boxes) the selection can be made with the arrow keys, a selection field can currently only be left with the tab key or mouse. If the input is repeated in the course of several bookings, the value from the previous booking can usually be transferred into the field by pressing the 'F8' key. Functionality: Before you start your daily work after logging in, please make sure that you are in the correct business year: Display at the bottom left of the main window. The session date is displayed in the bottom right of the main window. Especially if you have just started a new business year, it is advisable to pay special attention to this. You may have to change the financial year or, in exceptional cases, the session date. Booking: First select the document type according to the posting event, for example, 'A/R invoice'. This will display the fields required for this posting. The most common posting transactions described below are offered by default. All other posting transactions are carried out using a split posting. Split booking: For example, if you want to post an A/P invoice in partial amounts to different accounts, first press the 'Split' button. This will automatically change the layout of the posting mask for the special requirements of a split posting. A journal window appears in the lower part of the booking mask as well as further buttons and fields: Each of the partial amounts can be posted as a debit or, if necessary, also as a credit according to the document. The page exchange is carried out via the 'Debit/Credit' button. The remaining amount is displayed on the right above the split booking window: The individual partial amount postings are confirmed with 'Post debit' or 'Post credit'. If an error has crept in, select the partial posting. You can then use the context menu (right mouse button) to correct the partial entry. The context menu offers the following options: After the balance has been cleared, the entire split posting is completed by clicking on the 'New document' button. It will then be posted to the specified accounts and displayed in the journal. .and by double-clicking you can access the booking journal and view the booking in detail:. Cost allocation: The value of a cost element posting can be distributed to different cost centres and/or cost objects. The window for cost distribution can only be left if either all costs have been distributed (\"Post\" button is active) or no costs have been entered (\"Cancel\" button is active). Distribution postings that have already been entered can either be changed or deleted (via right mouse button or menu \"Entry\"). Error messages: Before a posting document is finally posted, the system performs checks. If any of the checks fail, one of the following error messages is displayed:. Booking batch: On the second tab of the booking screen there is a list window showing the bookings made in the current session and their total balance. By selecting one of the entries and double-clicking on it, the booking journal opens up, where it is possible to check and verify that the booking has been made correctly. To continue with the booking, do not click on 'Close', but simply return to the 'Book' tab. As an alternative to double-clicking, the right mouse button can be used to open a context menu with the following options: By means of the \"Print\" button, the batch of entries can be printed out as a list. Unbooked vouchers: On the third tab of the booking window there is a list of unbooked receipts. If an interruption occurs during the booking (currently e.g. in the case of larger split bookings) or if you have mistakenly not completed the booking correctly, it will remain in the \"Unbooked vouchers\" window. If necessary, you can click on this tab, mark the corresponding booking line and open and select the context menu with the right mouse button:. Settings booking mask: On the fourth tab in the booking screen you can manually change the default settings from the client master data for the individual booking session. Document settings: In addition to the settings you can make for your respective posting session, general settings for the financial accounting document can be made depending on the posting type under the advanced settings of the document presettings. For example, the bank details, the address for a cheque or the e-mail address for the payment advice can be specified for individual suppliers for outgoing payments. OP Compensation: If a person booking is made, the OP account is automatically displayed after the account number is entered. From this view, you can then select any open items to be cleared ( Clear button). For security reasons, the balance of the open items selected in this way is not automatically transferred to the booking mask, but must be entered manually in the general ledger booking mask. If this manually entered amount is equal to the sum of the open items to be cleared without deduction, the entry is made immediately. If the amount is lower (or unequal), i.e. a deduction was made on payment, for example, this OP Compensation window opens for closer examination of the difference or for checking the distribution of the possible deductions to cost centres or cost units. This window also opens if the deduction was justified e.g. due to a discount granted. One clearing entry is displayed per control key. You can change the difference amount or the adjustment accounts by double-clicking or using the context menu (right mouse button). If lines with no amount remain in the list, these are omitted in the subsequent posting. A difference amount may, for example, differ from the \"discount possible\" amount if charges have reduced the payment amount. In this case, a new clearing entry can be created directly, which displays the fee amount (without a control key). (The original clearing entry must of course also be reduced by this amount). In the standard case, it is assumed that the clearing amount is a granted/drawn cash discount. However, if it is a clearing of open items with foreign currency, where the balance of the foreign currency amounts itself does not result in a difference, a clearing entry is created via the currency loss, profit accounts. context menu: The possible clearing entries automatically differentiated by the system according to control key and account assignment can be edited in this mask. Buttons: From a single open item account (customers, suppliers, employees, representatives) or from the listing of open items, foreign currency operations can be revalued. The open items selected for this task are listed in this window. In addition, the currency table can be selected and displayed in the middle area of the window, by means of which the revaluation is carried out. In the lower area of the window, the currency loss and profit account can be specified and other details for the transfer posting can be made. Module name: finabook.mod.

Within such business processes, a document passes through the statuses specified by the business process, e.g. an order can have the status \"partially delivered\" with regard to the delivery process. In addition to these processes - which are firmly defined by corresponding specifications of the company process organisation - such processes must also be possible in which a user can freely decide who, when, should receive which document for inspection, checking, etc. These freely definable workflows correspond to the circulation folders common in newspapers or magazines, for example, which readers pass on to each other. In CyberEnterprise® (digital) circular files can be created for all documents, but also for any associations to e.g. documents, Excel, Word or pdf files, etc. and passed on electronically between the users. Each user recognises the processes to be processed by him in the folder \"My circulars\". A digital circular should always be used when direct e-mailing of documents between employees is not sufficient in terms of transparency of an entire process, as the employees' e-mail accounts cannot be viewed by third parties. The mask for creating a new circular depends on the progress indicator of the start state of the selected business process. If a new circular is created directly from a document via a menu item that may be present there in the maintenance screen or via the icon is created, the system checks whether this document has already been assigned to a circular with the same business process. If this is the case, the circular cannot be created in this direct way, but the circular must first be created and the document must be assigned to this circular as an association afterwards. A circular is also only entered as a successor document (in addition to the association) if the circular was created directly from a document. Creating a business process: To create a business process for processing the digital circulars, follow the steps below:. Parallel processing of a task: Floating files are usually processed sequentially. The circular is assigned to the start status - i.e. the first task to be processed - of a workflow and the processing of the data results in the subsequent task until the workflow is completed. A first simple parallelisation of this process is the simultaneous processing of a task by several responsible persons (employees or working groups). This is initiated by the multiple selection of employees/working groups when a task is forwarded. In this case a subtask is created for the subsequent task for each selected responsible person. The possible persons responsible for processing a circular in a status are determined by the status (see: definition of responsibilities). When processing the subtasks, the resources work simultaneously on the same data to be processed of the current task of the circular. This also means that each resource could process and complete the task on its own. Each resource finishes its part of the task by clicking the \"Done\" button. This causes the task to disappear from the pool of tasks to be completed by the resource. At the latest when the last resource finishes, all data of the task must have been processed so that a follow-up task results. If this is not the case, the completion message is aborted with a corresponding information message. The task is completed by forwarding the circular. If a task is processed by one resource in one, the subtasks of the other resources are marked as completed. Rules can be defined with regard to the responsibilities and completion notification by a responsibility (conditional responsibility and conditional completion notification). Parallel processes and follow-up processes: In parallel running processes and subsequent processes, new circulars are created as successors of an activity by branching to a status of another business process. Input window: This window is used to edit (the current (sub)tasks of a circular. This window is also opened during the initial creation of a circular if the progress indicator of the start state of the selected business process is empty or 0. Otherwise, the direct forwarding window is opened when a circular is created for the first time. The purpose of the distinction between the two windows is that the first creator of a circular sees himself as the initial processor in the workflow with the circular in the input window, while in the forwarding window he only initiates the processing. Forwarding window: This window is opened only when a circular is created for the first time if the progress indicator of the start state of the selected business process EQUAL is empty or 0. Otherwise, the normal input window is opened when a circular is first created. The purpose of the distinction between the two windows is that the first creator of a circular sees himself as the initial agent in the workflow with the circular in the input window, while in the forwarding window he only initiates the processing. List window: This window is used to list and search for floating files. Selection window: This window is used to select floating files. Option window: All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed with the \"OK\" button. Introduction: Circulars are controlled by business process objects (CX_WORKFLOW). These should always begin with FLOAT_FILE_xxx as the identifier (uniqueID) to enable a quicker distinction. A distinction must be made between the different workflows for specific business transactions, i.e. the workflow mechanism of the circular file itself. These business processes are to be assigned to the classification term \"WORK_FLOW\" and therein to the node \"FLOAT_FILE\". Each activity - regardless of the workflow - is always controlled by the business process FLOAT_FILE_ACTIVITY, which usually only has the statuses \"Received\", \"In process\" (after the activity has been called/read for the first time: slot read.date available) and \"Completed\" (slot end.date available).

For the purpose of sales planning, sales groups or parts can also be entered with their characteristics and quantities. An order planning made for a certain statistical period should not be deleted in the system if the incoming orders could not be realised. Instead, if the sales volume is still expected, the order planning document should be copied into a new statistics period. (This does not necessarily have to be the following statistical period) This newly copied document will then become the successor to the original planning document. This procedure must be followed to avoid double planning. Successors of an order planning can also be orders or order items. Both the order planning document and the order should have the same statistical period. Deleting an order/sales planning document is only possible in incomplete statistics periods.

This is done automatically with the objects previously registered in the PlugSpace. The variables occurring in a formula can themselves represent a formula or a condition table (object CX_CONDITIONED_BAG). The formula object can determine which variables it needs for the calculation (also in case of a formula in the formula etc.). The module Test Formula constructs a window for the input of variable values. For this purpose an object of the class CX_CONTAINER is used - an object whose only function is to hold any dynamic data fields. The result of a formula calculation can be a value - in case of an arithmetic expression - or TRUE/FALSE as the result of a logical expression. A formula ending with ; will not return a value. Attention: - The formula only calculates when the formula is ended / completed. - Value assignments to external variables are only executed when the formula is ended. Special features for use in conditional tables: Attention: If a variable definition (local a;) is present in the condition for conditional tables, no column may be inserted in the table, since the columns are evaluated before the rest of the condition and thus a separation by a semicolon would occur in the middle of the condition! In this case the following message is displayed when leaving the line: Operand expected! Attention: If columns are defined in a conditional table and the additional condition contains an OR link, then the entire additional condition must be placed in brackets, otherwise the preceding condition columns are ignored if the OR area is true! Example: (rF=\"right rising\"|rF=\"left falling\"). Input window: This window is used to maintain calculation formulas.

Here, the start and end dates and the procurement or throughput times can be changed graphically. These changes take place on a copy of the collective order to be able to carry out simulations or \"if-then\" situations. A check for material availability and feasibility (Available to promise / Capable to promise ATP/CTP) is also possible here (see checks) The scheduling mode (Schedule/Reschedule, Forward/Reverse) is displayed on the right above the graph. By displaying the critical path, it is possible to filter out the parts determining the end date and to process them directly. Only the shortening of lead times along the critical path has a direct effect on the end date. The gozintograph can be called for non-scheduled part requests, for already scheduled part requests with non-scheduled latecomers or for rescheduling a scheduled part request. Scheduled part requirement items are transferred to the Gantt chart for recalculation of the dates frozen with regard to the earliest start date (start no earlier than) and the latest end date (end no later than) when the graphical forward or backward scheduling is called up from the part requirement module. Only in case of a call via the menu item rescheduling, the dates are released - only for not (even partially) provided part requests. The calculated or manually changed dates and procurement or lead times can then be transferred back to the actual collective order (update project). Forward scheduling: In forward scheduling, the system plans from an earliest start date into the \"future\". By default, the current session date is set as the earliest start date. A change is possible by calling up forward scheduling again. Please also note the scheduling via work sequences. Backward scheduling: In backward scheduling, planning is carried out starting from a fixed end date in the \"past\". It is quite possible that a calculated start is before the session date of the processing, in which case a warning message is issued. By default, the latest end date is the planned date specified in the parts request (delivery, staging or production date), a change is possible by calling backward scheduling again. Please also note the scheduling via work sequences. Rescheduling: When rescheduling a part request, by default, all part requests that are not (even partially) provided will start a forward schedule starting from the current session date. This means, for example, that material withdrawals are (can be) always rescheduled - if they have not yet been withdrawn. If, however, an order with a desired or already confirmed date is available for an order part, then this date will be permanently included in the planning as the - initially unchangeable - earliest and simultaneously latest end date. The same applies to production parts whose production has already started: the original dates are taken over into the planning as fixed dates (start not earlier than, end not later than). Graphically, these fixed end points can be recognised by a green triangle to the right (start no earlier than) and to the left (end no later than). Thus, order and production parts can initially only be rescheduled if the corresponding business processes have not yet progressed \"too far\". These restrictions can be overcome in the planning process by deleting the respective fields \"Start no earlier than\" and \"End no later than\": right mouse click on a bar element in the graphic, then select \"Edit data\", then select the two fields one after the other and delete them with the \"Del\" key. Only in rescheduling mode can changed finish dates be transferred to a parts request, the departments concerned (Purchasing: Notification of suppliers/production: Rescheduling at workstations) must be informed separately that a changed deadline situation has occurred. After a rescheduling in the graphic, the system checks whether the dates of the subsequent documents (orders, exploded work plans) are still within the new date (from - to). If a follow-on document is no longer within this time frame, a list of all these items appears with the note that the follow-on documents must be rescheduled. For more details see here. The start date can be adjusted to start later than the current session date, or it can be switched to reverse scheduling mode Please also note the scheduling via work sequences. Capacity planning: There is also the possibility of dividing the production order blocks into work sequences for parts requirements. For this purpose, the Toobarbutton Capacity Check has to be set to display the clock symbol which is not crossed out. A bar now appears for each sequence of operations. The colour can be used to check whether the scheduled working time still fits into the planned capacity (grey = OK, red = too little capacity). By moving these bars, the work sequences can be directly rescheduled or their throughput times changed. The work sequences can also have a lead time of 0 days, contrary to the parts request items. When updating the project, the start of the first sequence of operations of a part request and the end of the last sequence of operations of the part request are written as new dates on the part request. If a production order has already been created and its work sequences have been exploded, the new dates just set are directly transferred to the work sequences and the end date to the production order item. Thus it is possible to reschedule individual work sequences without any problems. Scheduling according to production area-specific operating calendars: Only with this type of scheduling is it possible to take into account the operating calendars of the individual production areas or workstations. In the graphical scheduling only the common non-working days are then marked dark. If a calendar week or a day is only free for some work sequences, then these work sequences cannot be shifted into this time period, while other work sequences can fall into this time period. Graphic: Used to display a gozintograph in the form of a Gantt chart. The dates of the individual parts can be moved by drag & drop or the lead time can be changed. Options: The following settings can be specified in the options window: Grouping: filters: To get a better overview, it is possible to remove individual disposition types from the diagram.

For such Internet registrations, the Federal Statistical Office provides the so-called IDEV reporting system (Internet Data Collection in the Network of the Federal and Länder Statistical Offices) https://www-idev.destatis.de/idev/.Further information on reporting in intra-trade can be found at https://www-idev.destatis.de/idev/doc/intra/hilfe.html.Instructions for completing the IntraStat reports can be found at https://www-idev.destatis.de/idev/doc/intra/doc/Intrahandel_Leitfaden.pdf.

If a monthly period is selected in the left part (tree view over the periods) and thus the documents are displayed on the right side of the window, the monthly period can also be deleted again using the right mouse button. The tree is divided per client. Therefore, if there are several clients, the system checks for each document whether a predecessor can be determined. If so, the system checks to which client the cost centre of the predecessor is assigned. The document is posted in the IntraStat of this client found. The individual rows in the list window can be edited using the right mouse button. Edit window IntraStat message: This window allows you to view and modify the details of the IntraStat message.

The rules are as follows: If the supplier outside the home country is located in a country within the EU and this supplier delivers to the home country, this is type \"A\" -- It is imported from the EU to the home country. If this foreign supplier also delivers to another EU country, this document is not taken into account. If the supplier is a national and delivers to another EU country, the type is \"D\". The EU is supplied from the home country Example for direct deliveries (source chapter 9.1 of the official filling-in instructions): Situation (intra-Community triangular trade) A German company D sells to a Belgian company goods which D has acquired in France. The goods are shipped directly from France to Belgium. Question: Where should Intrastat declarations be made? Answer: France (dispatch) and Belgium (arrival) require one Intrastat declaration each, whereas Germany does not. In principle, Intrastat declarations are only to be submitted in the EU Member States which are physically affected by the movement of goods as the Member State of dispatch or the Member State of arrival.

In these cases a warning message is issued on the IntraStat message. The invoice value is determined from the account assignment of the order item (first 3 elements of the accounted.amount vector = without freight / packaging ). If this vector is not present at the order item (no direct invoice successor item, item below set item or below price group), the order item value per unit is determined and multiplied by the delivery note item quantity.

        "output": "Inventory: This app supports the recording of current inventories (so-called stock corrections) as well as annual inventories in the form of one-time or permanent inventories. Since an inventory is supposed to represent a comparison/check of the (book) stocks in the DP system with the actual stocks in the warehouse, inventories are initially generated from data in the DP. In combination with the inventory analysis app, inventory sampling is also supported. Inventories are an important part of monthly and annual financial statements. As part of accounting, inventories are subject to strict organisational guidelines. Structure: There are 5 different ways of setting up an inventory: The following generally applies to the selection: If a part is invalid but still has stock in one of its storage bins, it is included in the inventory. If there is no stock quantity, an invalid part is not included in the inventory. By default, when an inventory is set up, the average price of a part in a warehouse is copied into the inventory document. This value can be subsequently changed in the inventory manually or by programme run. The date, value and quantity of the last inventory are also written to the new inventory document when the inventory is set up. This data can be viewed and further evaluated in the inventory analysis. Instead of creating a single inventory document with all storage bins, it can also make sense to create several inventory documents subdivided according to different storage bin areas. In the latter case, while an inventory document is still being counted in one storage bin area, the count of another storage bin area that has already been counted can be recorded and posted in the separate inventory document and then this storage bin area can be released. By means of the inventory analysis, it is nevertheless possible to obtain an overview of several inventories. Duplicate inventory items (same part, same storage bin) are generally not permitted by the system. Count: After creating the inventory document, a count list can be printed with which the actual count or inventory can then be carried out in the warehouse. Once the actual counted stocks have been entered in the count list, they are subsequently recorded in the inventory document. The counted stocks can be entered manually via the count list or via a mobile data entry station (MDE). Reconciliation and posting: After reconciliation of the counted stocks and the EDP book stocks, the inventory document is posted. Depending on whether a stock correction is desired or not, either only the difference is posted or the counted quantity is also saved in the system as a stocktaking quantity with date. Posted inventories can no longer be edited subsequently. The valuation on the inventory item is used to recalculate the moving average price. This valuation is taken from the currently valid average price of the part when the inventory item is created. More on this topic in the chapter \"Determining the new average price\". When posting, the posting of the items is divided into individual steps. This is necessary for very long inventories of many parts, otherwise the database is blocked too long for other users. If posting is interrupted, it can happen that individual items have already been properly posted, but others have not yet been posted. You can recognise the complete inventory posting as usual by the posting date on the inventory header document and the blocked posting button. As long as this is not locked, the inventory is not completely posted. Input window: This window is used to enter and maintain inventories. You can select an inventory by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". There are three views (details are described in the options window ): The count list hides all fields that represent the current stock in the ClassiX® system so that the count result is not influenced by the target quantity. These include: When posting, all totals are calculated automatically. A currency table valid for the inventory can be created at the inventory header. Position window: This window is used to maintain the inventory items. The quickest way to enter the inventory is to jump to the next / previous item with the arrow keys 'up' and 'down' after entering the values for an item. The data is automatically saved when you switch. If you select the Close button, no data is written to the database. The display and maintenance of the fields depends on the display options. List window: Used to search and list inventories. Sorting window: In this window, special sorting criteria can be made to sort the displayed items in the list. Draw number of samples: From this window, a freely definable number of samples can be taken from the inventory items in the inventory document currently being processed. After drawing the sample, only the items that were drawn by sample remain in the inventory document. The remaining items are removed from the display and kept in the inventory document as a noted item for the items originally present in the inventory document. You can therefore always select new samples from the noted item. Selection window: This window is used to select an inventory. Mobile data acquisition: This window is adapted in size and functionality to a mobile data collection station. The information such as inventory/line or storage location/article number should be scanned in order to only have to enter the counted quantity directly at the station. Options window: Here, among other things, all settings for the search can be made. The window can only be closed by pressing the \"OK\" button. Once options have been set, they can be saved as default options for the logged-in user. For this purpose, there is a context menu entry on the \"Preferences\" tab in the \"User preferences\" list, which can be used to save the current options. Determination of the new average price:: The determination of the new average price for parts when posting an inventory is done as follows: When creating inventory items, the current average prices are written to the document as the \"old average price\" and as the new valuation, as well as the current stock level of the selected storage bin as the SET quantity. Calculations are then carried out when posting: (Current total stock * current average price ) + (valuation * counted quantity storage bin) - (old average price * TARGET quantity-storage bin). / current stock quantity + counted quantity storage bin - SET quantity storage bin current average price unit of measure If a part now has stock in several storage bins, the new value will also only change the average price proportionally according to the new total stock. It is then not taken over 1:1 For a simplified explanation If the part only has one storage bin, the formula could be simplified somewhat: The first part of the formula is omitted because the SET quantity of the storage bin is the current stock and the old average price is the current average price: (valuation * count quantity-storage bin) / Quantity counted Current average price unit Example: The receipt shows a valuation of 10€/1piece. The quantity counted is 10 pieces. The value indicated on the inventory item is therefore taken over 1:1 as the new average price: Valuation * counted quantity == 100 EUR / counted quantity (10 pieces) = 10 EUR/piece Per denominator of current average price = 10 EUR / 1pc.

        "output": "Recurring outgoing invoice: This app is primarily intended for the creation of recurring outgoing invoices. In the second place, it is also possible to create evaluations of already created recurring A/R invoices or an overview of all recurring A/R invoices. A recurring A/R invoice to be issued can be defined via an order in two ways. Firstly, a sales order can be of the type \"maintenance contract\" and a payment condition of the type \"recurring payment\" and the settlement type \"lump sum payment\". This type of recurring A/R invoice is useful if, for example, the invoice is for flat-rate maintenance. A second way of defining a recurring A/R invoice is to enter an order item with a payment term of the \"recurring payment\" type. This option can also be used, for example, to bill for maintenance if the maintenance does not have to be paid as a lump sum (fixed price), but rather depending on a quantity (price per unit or per licence). In this case, the order item defines in more detail the amount of maintenance (e.g.: 15 licences * 100€/licence = 1,500€) and the payment conditions of the type \"recurring payment\" define the billing period (e.g. monthly, yearly, etc.). The rent for software, for example, can also be invoiced in this way. The preparation of such recurring outgoing invoices is based on the following rules: An A/R invoice is always issued on the first day of the period entered on the recurring payment term. The period (\"Check by date\") is used to check whether a recurring outgoing invoice should be issued by this date. Based on the interval defined in the condition, the system automatically checks how often and when the recurring outgoing invoice is to be created. Already settled, recurring outgoing invoices can be listed as an option. After listing the recurring outgoing invoices to be issued, the outgoing invoices can be generated for the selected entries by clicking on the invoice button in the toolbar. Items are combined to one A/R invoice if the order and the due date are identical. In this way, orders with different recurring payment items (e.g. 30 licenses as monthly rent + 1 monthly maintenance flat rate) can be settled via one invoice.

        "output": "Part master data: The ClassiX® system distinguishes between a part and the possible roles of a part. A part itself contains the descriptive data that can be named regardless of its use. For example, a part could be completely described by \"carpet\". Depending on its use, further data entities or roles are obtained: If the \"carpet\" is sold, then sales-specific data such as sales price, is maintained in the role sales item . Further roles would be order article (with data like main supplier, last purchase price) , production part (with data like bill of material, routing, lot size), etc. In ClassiX® any roles can be assigned to a part.Furthermore, ClassiX® distinguishes between single part, sub-part and variant part:A variant part describes a group of things or parts that are distinguished by certain characteristics: For example, \"carpet\" can be distinguished by colour and width. We then say that the variant part \"carpeting\" is described by the characteristic bar with the characteristics colour and width.A subpart is a unique characteristic of a variant part, e.g. \"Carpet: Colour red, width 4m\" . There is a direct assignment to a variant part, in our example to the variant part \"carpet\". Sub-parts can be detached (decoupled) from a variant part at any time and thus become an individual part.Individual parts are not variant parts and are not subordinate to a variant part. Individual parts can, however, be subsequently assigned (coupled) to variant parts. Usually, most EDP systems only support single parts.The advantage of processing with variant parts is that previously unknown characteristics of a part do not always have to lead to data entry. For example, if a customer wants a \"carpet\" with the colour pink and a \"carpet\" of this colour has never been processed before, this \"carpet\" can be ordered directly from the supplier as a variant part with the new characteristic pink without entering a new order article.The characteristic bar of a variant part consists of various characteristics or attributes. In our example above, these were the attributes colour and size . The attribute size can also be a formula attribute, i.e. it is calculated from the attributes\"length times width\". In this case, the attributes length and width must be specified in the subpart.The variant part \"carpet\" can of course be specified more precisely by further attributes. For example, material type (such as wool, plastic, or similar), pile thickness (in mm), pattern, etc. would be possible. One could even go so far as to define all carpets in the world as a sub-part of only one variant part. However, this would require an increase in the number of characteristics to be able to describe each carpet in a sufficiently distinguishable way from the others.To what extent parts are described with different variant parts - or whether variant parts are used at all - depends very much on the individual case. A DIY store may have only a few (or even only one) \"carpet\" variants, whereas a carpet manufacturer will prefer a more structured structure of its \"carpet\" variants. Input Window: This window is used to maintain the part master. You can select a part by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If several parts with the entered number exist, the selection window with these parts is displayed. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". In the menu under \"Edit -> Variants -> Filter part number\" you can set which part type can be searched for in the field number. When you create a new part, you should first determine whether it is a single part, a variant part or a subpart (Edit -> Variant part -> Part type). The part number for single and variant parts should be unique. When creating a sub-part, the 'Variant part' field appears to select the variant part to which the sub-part is to be assigned. Then assign a part number that makes sense to fit into the part master. Subparts can be created very easily by first calling up its variant part and then pressing the 'Insert' button in the list of subparts. A subpart is then automatically created, linked to the previously called variant and you only have to maintain the specific attributes / characteristics of the part. Existing subparts can be copied by right-clicking on the subpart to be copied in the subpart list of the variant part and selecting \"Copy\". All part data is copied to the new part, including all characteristic settings as well as MRP and stock account settings. Part roles and provision data on the logistics account are not copied. You can create a new part role by calling up the corresponding menu item in the \"Edit\" menu. If the part role has already been defined, it is indicated by a button in the toolbar. You can change the stock data of the part with the button or the menu item \"Stock account\" to view and change it. With a tick in front of Spare part or QA part you can declare the new part as a spare part or provide it for QA inspection. In the lower section of the window, under Characteristics, you can insert or delete characteristics. Save your data with OK. You can use the validity to exclude individual parts that are no longer to be used from the current part master. It should be noted that this also has an influence on parts lists and stock levels. Invalid parts can lead to error messages if they have not been replaced. To be able to edit existing parts, select the corresponding part via the selection window by double-clicking on it. Via 'Edit' you can change search terms, insert and create characteristics, jump to the warehouse account, the purchasing data, etc. and edit them. Since non-controlling attributes can be assigned to each subpart, they appear grey in the list. The column headings of these attributes change depending on which subpart you have selected. Controlling attributes are shown in turquoise. Subparts can be decoupled from the variant part and then treated as individual parts in the system. This way, the part could then be declared invalid, for example. A picture can be stored for a part in the \"Picture\" tab. This is then saved in the database. A picture can be loaded via the button \"Select picture\". The radio buttons allow switching between the display in original size and the dynamically adjusted view, where the image is displayed in the current window size. Convert to batch-managed part: Create a batch-managed part from an existing single part. Part status: The part status defines the different statuses that a part can have. The part status is thus an important element of the part life cycle. The part status is defined via the status term \"ITEM_STATE\". This evaluation group can contain both simple structure nodes and structure statuses . In the case of structure status, the status is automatically determined by transition conditions in other structure statuses. All simple structure nodes and the beginning of the status chain of the structure statuses are displayed for selection. Thus, the classification term \"ITEM_STATE\" could be structured as follows, for example: - In progress - Locked - Released (with conditional follow-up status) In this example, the UNDER_WAY, LOCKED, DELETED and RELEASED statuses can be set in the part by the user. RELEASED can be selected because this is the only structure status that is not referenced by any other status and is therefore recognised as the start status. The subsequent statuses are then derived from the data of the part. In the right-hand image, the status RELEASED is also shown next to the status definition. Through the transition condition (Expr.) \"true\", the part is automatically forwarded to the next status. From the next status, the status then determines which part data must be recorded and the part status is switched on when this has been done. The following examples provide an overview of the data that can be queried and the formula expression that can be used to do this. Options for editing and using the parts can be stored at the individual statuses. These options are stored as attributes at the structure node (see also Attributes/Properties and there in particular the paragraph: Attributes with control function). Common disposition or stock account for variant parts: Attention: These option fields are only visible if the option to set the joint accounts on the\"Logistics\" tab has been set via the client! For variant parts, it is possible to create a common disposition and warehouse account for all sub-parts and the variant part. This is useful, among other things, if it is irrelevant in which version a variant part is in stock. In this way, an MRP movement of a sub-part is only registered in the MRP account of the variant part. Nevertheless, all information on which sub-part the corresponding movement refers to remains available. This common account is activated via the part master mask via the checkbox \"Common MRP account\". If different MRP accounts already exist for the existing subparts, these are collected and moved to the MRP account of the variant part. See also AccountOwner. It is also possible to split this common dispo account again via the menu item Edit->Split dispo account. Now all individual entries are assigned to the corresponding sub-parts again. Change part settings with Wizzard: This wizzard can be used to set settings for a group of selected parts in one. The selection of parts can still be changed with the wizzard open. The checkboxes in front of the groups \"Part class\", \"Manufacturer\", \"Product number\", \"Status\" and \"Properties\" can be used to hide or show the data fields. Data fields that are shown are changed in the parts by the wizard. These groups are not changed by hiding them. Options window: Here you can select whether the name, e.g. \"FAB_TEIL\", or the description, e.g. \"Fabrikat\", of the individual characteristic is to be displayed in the column headers of the characteristic columns in the list of subparts. Each time the input window is opened, the option is reset to the default, i.e. the display of the name. When confirming a selection with the OK button, the input window is not completely rebuilt but only the list of sub-parts. List window: Serves to list the parts. Various other data related to parts can be dragged into the list. Among others, these are:. Option window (list window): All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed with the \"OK\" button. Selection window: This window is used to select a part. The part roles and allocations are displayed on the right-hand side. These lists can be used to conveniently create the corresponding objects for the selected part. To do this, open the context menu in one of these small lists with the right mouse button and select the desired entry. Part weights (in one): In this window you can enter a weight for all previously selected parts, which is then transferred to these parts. Part weights (list): Parts are listed in this window so that their weights can be maintained individually.

Related to this are the modules Parts Usage (intended for use by technology) and Parts Consumption (intended for use by logistics). If you generally want to evaluate the use or non-use of a part in a certain period, you can do this by means of an inspection run. The selection can be limited according to document types (orders, parts requests, parts lists).

The button \"Select orders\" lists the possible customer orders, stock orders and preliminary requirements. Identical or similar parts, which are also on schedule, can now be selected - even across orders - as one production lot, for which a single, common gozintograph is then generated. At the moment, customer orders, stock orders and advance requirements cannot be planned together. For example, several sales order items or stock order items may be combined, but not, for example, a sales order item and a preliminary requirements item. Although the actual further processing of the gozintograph generated in this way takes place in the\"Parts request\" module, optional specifications for the automated further processing of the gozintograph can already be made in this parts scheduling module: Automatic determination of the disposition type, the procurement time and execution of a first parts scheduling as forward or backward scheduling. During the automatic construction of the gozintograph, variant parts are checked again to see if the feature bar is fully developed. If this is not the case, the construction of the Gozintograph is aborted. (A corresponding \"Test Create Gozintograph\" can be carried out in advance). In the case of variant parts, a new attempt is also made to find a suitable lower part: if this is successful, the variant part is replaced by the lower part in the gozintograph. The gozintograph is built up in two phases, the progress of which is shown in the bottom status line of the mask: Phase: Sorting the parts lists according to parts and production stages Phase: Building the Gozintograph Important note: Basically all parts of the selected production parts lists are transferred to the Gozintograph. There is, however, one exception: If BOM items have been marked as\"constructive assembly\" in the master data, these entries will be read over, only the parts underneath (= the BOM items of the BOM item marked as constructive assembly) will be included in the Gozintograph - increased by one production level or decreased by one disposition level. Although in the modules for BOM maintenance the indicator\"constructive assembly\" can only be set if the part is an MRP production part, this is checked again in phase 2: The identification\"constructive assembly\" is ignored exactly if a part is no longer an MRP production part. Input window: With 'Order' the window 'Completed and exploded parts lists' opens. After you have entered an order number, all items of the order are listed which have been successfully exploded. You can then select individual lines in the list or all lines via the menu item 'Edit - Positions - Select positions'. Copy the marked positions with 'OK' or by drag & drop into the window 'Part disposition'. This processing window is thus used to compile all the order or advance requirement items that are jointly transferred to production as a collective order. All common parts of this collective order are then planned, scheduled and further processed together in the gozintograph.

        "output": "Parts Variance Analyser: The constantly changing requirements in the markets lead to a constant adaptation and expansion of the own product range (external variance). In addition, the company's own engineering and production also contributes to changes in the parts used (internal variance). This external and internal variance often leads to a constant growth of the own parts base and can lead to increasing difficulties to configure the own products customer-specific and error-free.Carefully constructed parts classes or other ontologies can help to keep an overview and order in the parts master, but they usually cannot prevent the parts master from growing per se. Also missing is the definition of a configuration logic for the own products.By introducing sustainable variant management, the growth of the parts master can be slowed down sustainably, which automatically leads to an increased overview, improved order in the parts master and overall to improved efficiency in the production process. On the other hand, the necessary configuration logic for one's own product range results almost in parallel.For this purpose, it is first necessary to find \"similar\" parts in the part master, i.e. to find and structure groups of parts in such a way that the individual members of a group can only be unambiguously described by different versions of one and the same set of characteristics. The attribute scale itself is determined by the group and is therefore valid for all members (parts) of the group.For each group of parts, a so-called variant part with its specific characteristics is then created. The parts of the group are then assigned to the variant part as so-called sub-parts, whereby the characteristics list is defined for each of these sub-parts according to the characteristics of the sub-part. The sub-parts assigned to a variant part clearly show the differences between these sub-parts with regard to the characteristic values of the features.Here it can often already be established that sub-parts have been defined unnecessarily, since their characteristics - clearly described by the characteristic bar - are quite comparable and even substitutable with other sub-parts of the same variant part.The consistent introduction of product features, product feature strips and variant parts gives the entire parts master a clear structure. The focus is no longer on the individual parts, but rather on material features, i.e. characteristics that determine the parts to be used. The rules of configuration logic then only refer to characteristics - i.e. properties - and no longer directly to part numbers.This separation of the configuration logic from part numbers also makes it possible to determine configurations with parts for which there is still \"no part number\": in this case, the configuration determines variant parts with those characteristics for which there is (still) no subpart in the variant part. This does not have to be the case, because the desired - non-existent - part is clearly specified by the variant part and the distinct attribute list. With this unambiguous specification, it can be processed throughout the entire logistics process even without a system in the part master.Variant parts and their associated lower parts with a distinct list of characteristics can thus help to increase the diversity of the product range without creating an overflowing parts master: in this way, variance can be controlled. Functionality: With this module, groups of parts can be found by examining the words in the part designations. For this purpose, all part designations are first broken down into the individual words. Each of these words holds all the parts in whose part designation this word occurs. By forming intersections or unions of these individual words it is easily possible to put together groups of parts of \"similar\" parts. List window: In this window, the entire functionality for analysing the variance of a parts master is summarised. The following procedure is recommended when analysing the parts variance: This procedure assigns more and more individual parts to variant parts, thus increasing the structure of the parts master.

A work plan consists of work sequences, which in turn may have their own work plans. Each sequence of operations describes which workstations and which machines are required for the production of the part and for how long. The basic heading includes an operation, a work station and a machine, and the times required for production are recorded. A variant item is a conditional list of basic headings. When exploding the routing, the (single) item whose condition is the first to be fulfilled is used. Input window: This window is used to maintain work plans.

If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". If you create a new work plan, you must first save it before you can add work sequences. The creation date and user are preset and can be changed. A work plan consists of one or more items, which can be structured differently: The single item contains a resource (work centre, work group, machine, supplier) which is required in the specified (constant or calculated) quantity. If a supplier was specified as a resource on the routing item, this is referred to as an external work sequence(extended workbench). This means that the work defined using this sequence is not carried out by the company itself, but is ordered from the supplier specified in the resource. For more information, see Extended Workbench - External Sequences. Since routings themselves are only assigned to the part to be produced (the part to be finished, e.g. water pump), but the purchase order for the external work must be created via another part or unit of activity (e.g. unit of activity galvanising), the order article via which the external work is ordered can also be specified on the work sequence. An external work sequence therefore contains the following data, which makes it an external work sequence: A variant item is a conditional list of basic headings.

This means that if you search for LENGTH=34mm, a BOM/routing item is not displayed, even if it contains a quantity table with an entry LENGTH=34mm. Likewise, conditional BOM/routing items whose condition exactly matches the searched expression are not found. Only if this position also has the fixed attribute LENGTH=34mm, it will be found.

This module is used to record individual work sequences, i.e. work sequences that are only to be carried out at the workstation/resource specified in this work sequence. Only the set-up time and the piece time can be entered as a formula - and therefore variable. If a sequence of operations is to be defined variably with regard to the workstation/resource, a conditional sequence of operations can be inserted into the work plan. Distribution or calculation of production costs: In principle, the production costs for a part are divided into two differently valued parts: Labour costs and material costs As a standard, the additional costs incurred in addition to wages and materials, e.g. for purchasing or stock management of the required parts, are included in the overheads. These are stored globally in the client. However, the following approach is preferable in order to be able to calculate production costs precisely according to other costs incurred during production, such as machine running costs and programming costs, without having to include all costs invisibly in overheads: In the part or at the work plan position, a material characteristic must be defined which contains the costs for e.g. the machine costs per hour according to the following format costs = 120€/h (see below in the picture in the work sequence) You must therefore create a material characteristic for each cost element. The characteristic can also be stored directly on variant parts and calculate itself from other constraints (calculated or conditional characteristics). To be able to take these costs into account, a formula in the resource of the work sequence is necessary (in the picture the standard costs of the working group): Standard costs = formula = costs+(40€/1h) Since the formulae do not know any compound units, instead of 40€/h --> write 40€/1h and put this in brackets. The machine costs per hour specified via the material characteristic are now added to the standard machine costs per hour. In order to check whether the costs are actually there without any error occurring, the formula can be extended by a query as follows In this case, the system queries in advance whether the costs have been found and otherwise uses the value 0?, whose unit is based on the next component for further calculation. In the parts precalculation we then immediately see the result: The marked line is our work sequence, which has received wage costs of 1.600€ for 600 minutes (10 hours) (120€ machine running costs + 40€ standard costs = 160€ per hour * 10 hours = 1600€).

        "output": "KPI Auditors: KPI auditors are observers of transaction documents for the definition and determination of business key figures = Key Performance Indicators (KPI). KPI auditors can be used to collect key figures for supplier evaluation, machine utilisation or the quality of a cost centre, for example. The KPI auditors determine the key performance indicators by name and also the set of rules according to which they are determined. The KPI auditors are integrated either via the business processes (workflows) of transactions, whereby the key figures themselves are processed via transaction descriptions, or by direct assignment to business objects. The KPI Monitor App is responsible for the actual display and evaluation of the KPIs defined by means of this app. Evaluation types: There are three types of indicators: Evaluated key figures (ratings), auxiliary key figures, counters and values. Key figures of the type counters and values can be derived directly from a document and are summed up in the key figure monitors for the suppliers, years and months. These can either be evaluated directly in the statistics or serve as auxiliary key figures for the evaluated key figures. Examples counters: number of invoices, number of orders, etc. Examples of values: total value of goods, total discounts taken, etc. Auxiliary key figures are not key figures per se, but serve as intermediate variables only for a clearer calculation of the key figures. They are therefore created as attributes of the type \"for internal purposes only\" and are thus hidden in the lists for compiling the statistics, among other things. Valuatedkey figures (evaluations) are not determined directly via the document and written to the monitors, but they result at the time of the evaluation. The sum of the evaluated key figures is the best way to compare different business objects (customers, suppliers, etc.). The determination of the evaluated key figures can itself be differentiated into three types: In the monitor list, the total evaluation can be determined according to the three calculation types mentioned, but the individual key figures are only displayed in two calculation types. On the one hand, this is the type \"Normal average\" and on the other hand the type \"Cumulated average\". If the type \"Moving Average\" is selected, the individual key figures are displayed cumulatively. Thus, there may be slight differences in the formation of the cross sum. Definition of key figures: The definition of the key figures can best be explained by means of an example. Let the deviation of the confirmed delivery date from the requested date be a key figure for supplier evaluation. The key figure should not be the deviation in days itself, but a weighted value that results from the deviation. (0days = 10%; 1day=8%;2days=6%;.) The basis for determining a key figure is always a document (a transaction), in this example an order item. Data fields of an order item are both the requested delivery date and the delivery date confirmed by the supplier with his order confirmation. The difference between the two dates in days is also stored on the item as the data field confirmed.value. When setting the date of the order confirmation in the order item, the above key figure is processed in the following way: Via the transaction descriptions, first the data cube with the one dimension KPI Monitor of the KPI Auditor \"Supplier rating\" (determined via: Status Monitor -> Workflow(StateMonitor(\"CONFIRMATION\").owner.ClearingObject(\"CX_KPI_AUDITOR\").ForceMonitor(CX_KPI_MONITOR))) and the other dimension KPI Monitor of the supplier (reached via: TopTransaction().supplier.ForceMonitor(CX_KPI_MONITOR)) is determined/created. To determine an accrual-based KPI, the corresponding sub-accounts for the calendar year and month are then determined/created. In the KPI Auditor object, the desired key figures are defined and stored as calculated or conditional attributes. In our example, this is the attribute confirmed.numeric for the weighted deviation. This conditional attribute returns the weighted deviation as a numeric value 10, 8, 6 etc. depending on confirmed.value (the deviation in days between the requested and confirmed delivery date, which is/are stored on the order item itself (see above)). This value is determined via the transaction description (via: Status Monitor -> Workflow -> KPI Auditor(StateMonitor(\"CONFIRMATION\").owner.ClearingObject(\"CX_KPI_AUDITOR\").attributeSet.confirmed.counter)) and written away. The transaction description also stores the writing away of the key figure and the calculation of the new average. The following rules (an extract) should be included in the transaction description: The same rules apply for goods receipt (counter (received.kpiCounter) and evaluated deviation(received.kpiNumeric) between goods receipt date and confirmed delivery date (in days = received.value)) and key figures about the delivery quantity (delivered.kpi*). Multidimensional OLAP cubes: The data collected via the KPI Auditor can also be collected and evaluated multi-dimensionally. For example, incoming orders can be evaluated according to sales area and article group. For this purpose, the orders are booked into an OLAP cube, which has the sales area and the article group as an edge/dimension. The period year and month can be sub-dimensions of this data cube. Through the OLAP cube, the turnover per sales area or per article group or per article group per sales area can be read directly in this example. Via the dimension filter that can be optionally set in the list, it is possible to filter the result set according to a dimension. In this way, for example, you can limit the evaluation to the data of a sales area and hide the other OLAP cubes. It is also possible to group dimensions. Let's assume there are the dimensions sales territory (India, China, Japan, Australia, Europe, America) and article group (services, spare parts, products). This would result in 15 data cubes. If you now want to evaluate \"Service in Asia\" with the corresponding dimensions (India, China, Japan - services, spare parts), this is not easily possible. The solution is a conditional attribute that creates a grouping of the dimensions. The evaluation can then be run via the column that results from this.

With this app, the texts occurring in the AppsWarehouse® (InstantView® code) (see also Text Constants in the InstantView® Framework) can be is displayed, adapted to specific company requirements and/or can be translated into all other languages required. By default, all texts in AppsWarehouse® Code (window titles, field labels, hint texts, etc.) are written in German as the first and English as the second, so-called bridge language. The respective expressions in these two languages together form the \"key\" for unambiguous identification of a text. Using this \"key\", the texts can be changed (for alternative designations: e.g. device - instrument - installation) and/or freely assigned to a language as of the third language (French). These extensions and/or changes to the texts from the AppsWarehouse code are written to the file appsWHLiterals.stg (formerly: cxstring-uc.002) with the above-mentioned \"key\" (see Stored text constants in file cxstring_uc.002).At runtime, the displayed texts are then adapted/overwritten/extended using the entries in this file.In addition, you can have a *.info file created (usually cxstring-uc.002.info), by means of which you can freeze a specific version of the AppsWarehouse text constants. If changes are made in the AppsWarehouse code afterwards, it can be determined in which modules/apps certain text constants used to be (see Text constants unrelated to AppsWarehouse®).The languages that can be selected or used at runtime are defined in the location-specific data (language, system number of the language). How many and which languages are actually to be used within an application is specified in the client under System/Language Control. If nothing is specified there, the number of languages is determined directly from the location-specific data. List window (Text Literal Browser: AppsWarehouse).: This window is used to list all text literals that occur in the AppsWarehouse® (i.e. in the InstantView® code). The loading/listing is done via the menu item \"Load Text Literals of the AppsWarehouse\" or the corresponding button in the toolbar. The two tabs show different views of the text literals in AppsWarehouse®. The first tab shows all occurrences in the AppsWarehouse® starting from the literals, while the second tab shows the various associated literals starting from the access expressions. Literals: If an entry is marked in the list, all places where the marked text occurs are output in the lower list (used in AppsWarehouse). A double click opens either the corresponding window or the position in the code. The texts of a Text Literals itself are maintained by double-clicking in the editing window. Access Expressions: This tab is mainly used to book access expressions with the corresponding literal in data connectors. The upper part is used to filter the desired access expressions, while the lower part is used to select and update the corresponding literal. It is also possible to automatically update several access expressions at once. Editing window (Text Literal Editor: AppsWarehouse): This window is used to maintain individual text literals of the AppsWarehouse. The default languages are German and English. If text literals are changed (as alternative names) or languages are added, these text constants are stored in the file with the name appsWHLiterals.stg in the current system directory (this usually corresponds to the directory CX_ROOTDIR\\system). Whether and which texts have been changed or extended by further languages can be displayed in the list window via the menu item Saved text constants in file appsWHLiterals.stg. ATTENTION: The file appsWHLiterals.stg is created for the first time when loading the text literals from the AppsWarehouse. It is therefore already present even if you have not yet changed any text constants. In this \"empty\" state, the file can be deleted without disadvantages, but if text constants have been changed or languages have been added, these entries are irrevocably lost when the file is deleted. Text Literal Wizard: AppsWarehouse: This window is used for mass maintenance of AppsWarehouse text literals. This is the case if a company wants to generally change some of the designations used in the standard AppsWarehouse (e.g. Product -> Production item). Text Usage Wizard: AppsWarehouse: This window is used to maintain the use of the text constants in the programme code, i.e. changes are made directly in the programme in the code. Stored text constants in file appsWHLiterals.stg: This window lists the text constants stored in the file appsWHLiterals.stg. If the list is empty, no text constants have been changed, nor have additional languages been added. Text constants without relation to AppsWarehouse: If text constants have been changed or additional languages have been added to them (i.e. there are stored text constants in the file appsWHLiterals.stg), but they no longer appear there due to changes in the AppsWarehouse code, they will be listed in this window. Text Literal Translations: AppsWarehouse: With this app, languages other than German (first language) and English (bridge language) can be assigned to the (previously selected) text constants.

        "output": "Location data: Important! Please also read the description on the subject of location-specific data in the installation documentation This module is used to create, maintain and manage location-specific data. These can represent and explain federal states, provinces and any deeply nested regions. When a user logs on to the system, the system checks whether a separate company calendar (locale) exists at the employing company (place of employment of the employee). If so, this locale calendar is logged on, otherwise it is checked whether the locale has one and so on up to the top locale. If no company calendar was found in this way, the system checks whether there is a locale at the client company and registers it. If no locale is linked here either, the locale specified in the batch file via the environment variables for country, state and region is registered. As the ClassiX® system knows the connections between different localities, for example the superordinate country of any state or region, the following possibilities arise: Generally speaking, a country's characteristics are handed down to a federal state and then to subordinate regions. However, some of this information can be overwritten by directly changing a certain property in a subordinate locality, for example a federal state. Now this new property applies to this subordinate locality and all its subordinate localities, for example regions. Of course you can also change the same property in some of the subordinate localities, for example in regions. However, a region can also pass on properties to a federal state and this to the higher-level state. This is the special case where a superior locality has at least all time zones of its subordinate localities. Of course, the time zones of the superior locality can be extended, but not restricted. This is another reason why you need to be sure where you are making settings. That is why the characteristics of a locality are divided into informative characteristics of the superior country, characteristics to be set in the superior country and characteristics to be set in this locality: Informative characteristics of a country are: - Country name - Country code - Number plate - Winter/summer time or summer/winter time changeover These properties are taken from internal tables and cannot be changed by the user to ensure consistency with reality. These informative properties are valid for the country and all its subordinate localities. The characteristics of a country to be set are: - National currency - International area code - Number format - Date and time These characteristics are from a superior country, not from a subordinate locality, and must therefore be changed at the state level. These properties to be set are valid for the country and all its subordinate localities. The properties of a locality to be set are: - Place name - Language - System number of the language - Time zone or start and end time zone (regions have only one time zone) - Working days - Telecommunications - Holidays and holidays These properties are specific to a particular location and can therefore be set at all levels. If these properties are only set at state level, they are also valid for all subordinate localities. However, as mentioned above, these can be changed at a subordinate local level. These changes are valid for the edited locality and all its subordinate localities. Telecommunication is an exception, as these settings are only valid for your own locality, neither taken from above nor transferred to below. A special case of informative features are the federal state and region codes. These are automatically assigned by the ClassiX® system when the corresponding localities are created and can be used in combination with the state codes to set the environment variables in the project-specific batch file. You can read more about this in the description of location-specific data in the installation documentation. Attention! If you make changes to the location that is currently set as the system location, you must first activate it by setting this location as the system location again. Input window: Fields. Operations calendar: In addition to the calendar for financial years in financial, fixed asset and cost accounting, as well as the personnel calendar for recording and maintaining absences (holidays, sick days) and working with flexitime, a company's non-working days are maintained in the company calendar. In this window, the previously entered operating calendar valid for the registered company or the registered user can be viewed and supplemented. As a rule, maintenance of the company calendar is the responsibility of the management. The entries added by an employee can be changed (double-click on list entry) or deleted. In the list, the added entries are additionally displayed in red font colour, so you can easily see which holidays are not directly location-specific, but really represent the company calendar and can be edited or deleted. Operating calendar entry window: This editing mask is used to enter or change user-defined operating calendar entries. The entry can be used for a single day off as well as for a period of several days. For this purpose, the period type can be set using the radio buttons. If it is set to \"Period\", an end date field is visible. This must then be filled with an end date. Please note that the changes made to the operating calendar only become effective after a ClassiX restart. Therefore it makes no sense to define today as a non-working day if users are already logged on to the system. The change is not effective for the users already logged in until they restart the ClassiX system once. See also operating calendar for the effects and links to business objects. Attention Date display in the list: After a change to an operating calendar entry without a subsequent restart, it may happen that the date display in the operating calendar list is still at the old value. Nevertheless the changes were taken over, also here the display is only updated after a ClassiX restart. Public holiday calendar: In the public holiday calendar, all public holidays defined in the system can be viewed - by country or by date. It is not possible to edit them here.

Evaluation: System crashes Blockade trigger - tree view This module is used to create various evaluations of log files and display them accordingly. The files are read out according to sessions (start of ClassiX® until end or crash). The remaining entries of the log file are thus assigned to the created sessions. If additional dbProf files are read in, these entries are assigned to the sessions by the OS Client ID, if possible. An option can be used to set whether or not the previous sessions should be reset before each import. If this option is not set, many days in a row can easily be read in. Either several selected files, entire folders can be read in (subfolders are automatically taken into account) or a time period can be specified in which all log files are automatically searched and loaded. Specifying a time period is best suited in MorphIT, because the MorphIT user does not have to worry about the location of the log files and whether they are on the same computer, especially since in this case no files have to be uploaded. The automatic reading of log files depending on the time period requires that the log files are stored in a temporal subfolder structure, i.e. the following option must be activated in logging.ini. log4cplus.OrganizeLogsByDate=true Selecting individual files also allows you to view files for sessions from different time periods and points side by side. In addition to the sessions and user logins, certain events such as deadlocks, timeouts, crashes, etc. are additionally summarised in monitors across sessions. After reading in, all sessions are displayed in the session list with the most important data. A session is opened by double-clicking on it and you can see what happened. In the Statistics tab, graphical evaluations can be created flexibly. The monitors can be assigned to the diagrams as desired. There is a maximum of 3 diagrams, whereby only one monitor can be assigned to a diagram. You can drag and drop the monitors into the diagram areas or select a monitor and then click on the corresponding \"Add monitor\" button. For dbProf statistics, the desired evaluation can be selected after a double click. In the X-axis option area, the evaluation variant can be selected, whereby the transactions are evaluated according to time or date. In the case of an evaluation based on time, all transactions are summarised according to their time, so that one can see, for example, which events have occurred at which time of day. In this case, it makes sense to load or select only sessions from a single day. The time span and the period length of the evaluation can be specified in the Options section. The period length self-explanatory determines the accuracy of the statistics. For statistics accurate to the minute, a period length of 1 minute should be selected, but this could lead to extensive graphs. If, on the other hand, you want to make a summary evaluation over several days, you should select the option by date. All transactions of a particular monitor are summarised in days and displayed graphically. You could also select the time of day under Options, outside which the transactions are not considered. The monitor user has the special feature that besides the normal evaluation of the login, the maximum number of simultaneous use of ClassiX on one day is graphically displayed. Either \"All sessions\" or \"Selected sessions only\" can be set as an option. With the option \"All sessions\" all loaded sessions are used for the evaluation, otherwise only the sessions selected in the session list are used. The option \"All sessions\" can be used to read and compare only dbProf files of different days. So it is not necessary to read in all files from each day. For any number of monitors the transactions can be viewed within a time span. This makes it easier to understand which events are interdependent within a limited period of time. In the tab Blocks/ Crashes/Locks the transactions mentioned above for the selected sessions are displayed. The locking conflicts can be viewed in a summary by \"Locked By\" (Who is locking the others?) and segment. Red lines in a list or also called ListView Fatals (crashes within a ListView) are displayed in the same tab. RO and RW long distance transactions are grouped by location and displayed in the Long distance TXNs tab. The average duration and the average number of pages read are also displayed. IV faults are displayed in a separate tab. Evaluation: Performance: The following options are available for evaluating performance and determining the causes of good/bad performance:.

Review cross-country skiers TXN: If long-runners that have been marked as blockage triggers (second column) appear in the list with more than two minutes: 5. Statistics: If more than 600 blockades occurred:. Evaluation: System crashes: For the evaluation of the system crashes the log files of the clients must be loaded, those of the server (cxdbprof.log) can be ignored. By double clicking on the monitor \"Crashes\" in the list of monitors all crashes are displayed. In the list each crash is described by three columns. (Error message of the crash, if a deadlock has occurred before, output of the C++ stack) In order to record a tendency of the number of crashes or to determine the increase/decrease of errors due to a difference, it is important to record key figures. This output of the key figures is done by clicking the corresponding button. By transferring the key figures daily to Excel, it is possible to make statements about the course of events. The following key figures are available:. List window: To carry out an evaluation, any number of log files must first be selected. The log files are first evaluated according to sessions. A session is the duration from the start of ClassiX® until the termination or system crash. If another ClassiX® instance is started during a session, a counter is incremented in the current session. If the option \"Reset sessions each time log files are read in\" is not set, log files can be read in one after the other without losing the previously read in sessions. If a file ends before a session is finished, the session end time is set to the time of the last event. If a log file does not start when ClassiX® starts, a session is created that takes the start time of the first event of the file. If errors occur during reading in, these can be viewed later in the window Errors during reading in. Columns of the session list: Double-click on a session to open the session window. The evaluations for the lists, blockades/crashes/locks, ListView Fatals, long distance TXNs and IV errors are always immediately created and displayed for the currently selected sessions. ListView Fatals: This list displays the ListView Fatals (Hard crashes within a ListView - Red lines) for the selected sessions. If these occur more than once at one point, they are displayed together. By pressing a Double-clicking on a list entry displays the contained transactions in the Contained Transactionswindow. Instantview error This list displays the Instantview errors for the selected sessions. Identical errors are summarised. By double-clicking on a list entry, the contained transactions are displayed in the Contained Transactions window. Session: This window displays all transactions included in the session sorted by timestamp. Transactions that are held in a monitor appear in red in the list (except for the dbProf statistics). Included transactions: This window displays all transactions included in the period sorted by time stamp. Locking Summary: Locking conflicts are summarised by Locked by and by segment. To view the individual Locks, simply select the appropriate summary and Locks will be displayed in the Locking Conflicts list. Error while reading in: The errors that occurred during reading are displayed here. Evaluation: In this window the diagrams of the evaluation are displayed. Blockade trigger - tree view: If users create time-consuming bookings, it can happen that other users are hindered in their activities, as individual data is exclusively blocked by the booking. The other users then wait for the end of the transaction before they can continue. They only notice this circumstance by an extended duration of the action they are about to perform. Such behaviour is called blocking. As long as the user is waiting for the release of his data, it is possible that he has already locked data for himself, for which other users must then wait. Similar to the snowball system, a network of blockades could develop in an unfavourable case, which is all triggered by the time-consuming booking of the first user. To be able to find such time-consuming bookings that block many users, this tree view is available. Here you can see who the first blocker was, who he blocked, and who was blocked by the other users. Users who have only been blocked without triggering the blockade themselves are not displayed at the top level of the tree. The behaviour of the snowball system must be prevented by targeted improvements to the source code - this tree view should help to locate the critical parts of the programme. System crashes: If the log level \"FATAL\" appears in a log file, this indicates that the machine has crashed. The next message with log level \"ERROR\" is the crash message that appears on the screen. The current session is closed and for this current transaction (crash message) the data field \"settings\" is displayed. The only exception is a \"FATAL\" from the logger \"cx.listview\". With this one, the system does not crash because the ListView catches it. If the system crashes without an error message, the last transaction (LogLevel \"FATAL\") is regarded as the end of the session and displayed in the list of crashes.

If an order was scheduled for 6.2.2012 and has a purchase order with the same date, but today is 7.2.2012 and the purchase order has not yet arrived, then the order is classified as a missing part and receives the shortage indicator in the MRP account. This item also appears in SCM as a missing part! (Technical note: If the variables checkInPastActivated and checkInPastGenerallyActivated are set to TRUE in SetOptions, this control is also active in the normal MRP account and the B&B list with schedule control). The disposition account can also be called up for individual company codes. Requirement triggers in the MRP account (requirement triggers reduce the stock): Project reservations with the status \"started Order items Advance requirementsPart requirements (dispositions) Stock Reserves Coverage of requirements in the dispo account (coverage of requirements increases the stock) Unordered requisitions Orders Stock orders Production orders Although documents such as goods receipts increase stock, they will never be seen in the MRP account because they do not represent a future movement but already reduce stock when the document is posted. Parts consumption and parts sales The dispatch account also shows how often the part has been used in the last year. For consumption, quantities are added up on transaction data in a certain period. The movement data includes goods withdrawals, goods receipts and direct deliveries not put into storage and production orders not put into storage. For Kanban parts, other evidence for the evaluation of consumption is included, namely the confirmed order items and the further processed part request items of the part. For Kanban parts it is not possible to use the two arrows to switch to the parts consumption overview in addition to the parts consumption, as the parts consumption for Kanban parts does not appear in this overview. Consumption from order items can be viewed via the sales item turnover display. The other consumptions via processed parts request items can only be viewed via the operation folder of the part. Sorting the documents: The shortfall analysis depends on the assumption of when and \"how certain\" the deadlines are. For example, if the dates are given as a time span, the \"true\" date can be determined by making the appropriate selection. Three sorting modes are provided to allow different views of the inventory development: If required from part requests (departure date), the planned date is composed of the earliest and latest start, which also results in a time span. With the evaluation type \"Strict\", the earliest date of this time span is always used for the evaluation, with the setting \"Medium\" exactly the middle and with \"Soft\" the end of the time span, i.e. there is the least buffer for the real demand. If planning (e.g. stock replenishment) is always to be carried out with a little air, the setting \"Medium\" is recommended, which is always set in the standard system. However, if there is little space in the warehouse or if the warehouse budget is always to be kept as low as possible, the setting \"Soft\" is recommended, whereby planning is always carried out on the actual demand date. Strictly means, therefore, that the goods are always already procured at the earliest possible date and may also lie in the warehouse for some time until they are needed, depending on how large the buffer times of the requirements were. Example (opening stock = 0 pieces): (Week 13, 2002: Mon=25.03., Tue=26.03., Wed=27.03., Thu=28.03., Fri=29.03., Sat=30.03., Sun=31.03.) Strict: Ordered goods are always late: Medium: first order comes too late: Soft: everything is fine: The document list cannot be sorted manually. Display of the current balance; balance check: The balance is carried forward into the future from the quantity available today (available stock + quantity received). The balance is increased with each planned receipt and decreased with each planned issue. Each time the MRP account window is activated, a balance control procedure is automatically performed for the part. During the check the result of the master calculation formula \"AVAILABLE_QUANTITY\" (the formula is defined to calculate the \"ideal\" available quantity of a part, based on data from the stock and MRP account; e.g: Warehouse stock + stock order + In production + Requested + Ordered + GR quantity + QA quantity - In order - Reserved) compared to the calculated final balance (the last balance in the document list). If the results are different, an error message about the difference is displayed; the difference is also shown in red below the list. It is important to note that the last column on the far right displays the MRP type with which a sales order or gozo item was posted to the MRP account, whether, for example, as a warehouse reservation or as a production order or requisition. This is particularly important if you have stock reservations listed in the B&B list for parts that currently no longer have the staging type, e.g. stock management. Then you can simply find out the document in the corresponding MRP account that was reserved in stock! If the option \"Split variants\" is set (see option window), and the part is a variant part, no balance is displayed, but the currently used variation of the variant part. See also variant filter. Display of the last parts sales: Above the list is another group. It shows the parts sales of the last 12, 6, 3 and the current month. The button on the right-hand side takes you directly to the parts turnover statistics. There the part is automatically selected and the sales of the last 12 months are displayed in detail. Variant filter: If the displayed part is a variant part and the option \"Split variants\" is activated, the corresponding quantities are split in the interim/stock and dispatch quantity lists according to the variation that has occurred. Above these lists there is a small button with a magnifying glass, which opens these lists enlarged. This also allows sorting by variation or individual characteristics. If you double click on one of the lists, a filter is set on the document list, which corresponds to the clicked variation. Only documents with the same variation are displayed in the document list. The documents responsible for the clicked quantity are also marked. This filter can be changed via the Refresh toolbar button again. If the parts consumption list is opened with a filter set in this way, the filter is transferred and now also applies in the parts consumption list. Option window: Menu Menu item Description Edit - : Reset default settings Sets and displays the default settings defined via the module. Overview of variants: In the dispo account of a variant part, or one of its subparts, there is the possibility to display all subparts of the variant part and itself in a clear list with all its stock and dispo quantities one below the other. By double-clicking on an entry, the MRP account for the selected part is called up, but the list remains in the foreground so that it is easier to click through all the MRP accounts one after the other. By right-clicking on the list, the minimum, reporting and maximum stocks of the subparts can be changed directly in the list. Technical Documentation: FindCritical Date (FindCriticalMoment ) Call: SendMsg(FIND_CRITICAL_MOMENT) The method FindCriticalMoment can be used for two purposes, whereby the way it behaves is determined according to the transfer parameter. On the one hand, you can check whether a planned retirement is possible on a certain date and what effects this retirement has on the subsequent planning movements. The parameters checkQuantity and checkDate are absolutely necessary. The sorting parameter only evaluates the hard, medium or soft data(see above). Further specifications such as checkToDateLevel have no influence on this method. What makes the functions? First of all, the test output is sorted into the dispositive movements. This is done on the basis of the date. Then all operations are run through (simulated) once and the effect of the stock change through the test dispatch is analysed. The result of this test is the return code. What evidence has an influence on the outcome? Examples: Furthermore, this method can be used to check whether and when a minimum stock shortage occurs for a part. This information is also taken from the MRP account. This method makes sense when creating the requirements and stock list. As return parameters you also get a returnCode and a returnContainer. The returnCode determines the type of underrun. Except in the case that the returnCode is 0 (all o.k.) or 16 (ERROR) the returnContainer contains the following information:. Quality assurance: Test balance difference The message CHECK_DISPO_BALANCE_DEVIATION can be used to check whether a dispo account shows a balance difference. Call: SendMsg(CHECK_DISPO_BALANCE_DEVIATION) DISPO_BALANCE_DEVIATION_CHECKED is sent back to with the following parameters: Test FindCriticelMoment By calling \"SendMsg(TEST_CRITICAL_MOMENT)\" the functionality of the macro and the interface can be tested via a test window that opens. To do this, simply enter the corresponding values in the test value group and press Send. The return code is displayed as the result. In addition, the variable \"returnContainer\" is set so that you also have access to it via the monitor window. Module name: loggidac.mod. Classes: -."

In contrast, tools are defined as part roles in the ClassiX® system, just as plants are defined as part roles in ClassiX®. Machines have a manufacturer, are assigned to a workplace and incur costs. In operation, they can have standard set-up and piece times, they require tools and have a direct connection to the plant master. For preventive maintenance, work plans can be assigned to the machines as maintenance plans. Based on these maintenance plans, maintenance orders (in the form of production orders) are created.

This assignment is made in the module for maintenance of the machines ( Maintenance tab). There it is also defined from which date with which periodicity certain maintenance work must be carried out. If a maintenance order (in the form of a production order) is then issued, it is posted at the machine. This enables a reliable check of the maintenance work already carried out, and at the same time it is possible to determine when the next maintenance work is to be carried out again. The task of this module is to find the machines and their maintenance plans for which maintenance work is required next. Functionality: When clicking on the toolbar button is checked against all maintenance plans assigned to the machines to determine whether maintenance work is due from today. If maintenance is necessary, the due maintenance plan appears in the result list. By changing the date filter above the list, it is also possible to view the maintenance work due in the future.

        "output": "Recurring payment: The conditions \"Recurring payments\" are payment plans of a cyclical nature. They can be used for sales orders with the order type \"maintenance contract\" and control the billing cycle here. A maintenance payment can be of three different types: 1. cyclical lump sum payment 2. frame + expenditure 3. expenditure. Use of recurrent payments in sales: Lump-sum payments that are too cyclical: Via the list \"Maintenance invoices due\", the lump-sum payments defined via these cyclical maintenance payments that are due by a date can be viewed and the invoice can be generated from them. The subsequent invoices are all generated on the customer order with the maintenance payment. To frame + expenditure: Maintenance includes a fixed frame, for example €2,000.00 per month, plus extra material and service costs. In this case a service provider group must also be defined in the order, on which a repetition cycle is entered. Below this service provider group, the items representing the framework of, for example, €2,000.00 are now entered. Sub-items can also be created with a fixed sum, for example \"1 piece basic maintenance - fixed price €2,000.00\". No due maintenance invoices can now be generated from this order; the invoices are generated for the subsequent orders generated via the \"Due maintenance orders\" list. In this case, these receive an invoice status. The invoices are created on these orders. The frame (e.g. €2,000.00) is saved as a fixed sum on the order and the created order group. On expenditure: There is no fixed framework, the orders are only settled via their follow-up orders. The maintenance order contains a cyclical service provider group without subitems. This point is very similar to point 2, except that the resulting order group does not receive any predefined subitems. Since maintenance payments are transaction-specific data, the master conditions only serve as a reference. When inserting the condition, for example in an order, the condition is copied here and therefore always inserted locally.

        "output": "English:meta model: Due to its business model classes and data fields, Classix does not have a rigid model and therefore no central administration of entities and data fields. In order to be able to describe the dynamically created objects, their attributes and relationships, an ObjectCrawler is implemented with this module, which independently scans the database, collects, examines and categorises objects and stores this information as meta-description. These meta descriptions of the objects and their attributes and relationships can then be maintained here. Before starting the search, you must define the settings for the search, on which the speed and duration of the search depend. The following settings are available: Under the boundary conditions you can specify the maximum age of the meta-info. To speed up the search, meta-information is not overwritten and skipped if it is younger than the set date. Transaction splitting is used to specify after how many transactions (analyses of meta objects) the results are saved in the database. The maximum collection depth specifies how many elements of an M1, MN relation, or collection are analysed (if set to 0, all elements of a collection are searched). The maximum collection depth can significantly influence the duration of the crawling process, a value of 500, and 5 for very large databases, can lead to fast results. Equally important for the duration of the crawling process is the recursion depth parameter (-1 stands for infinite depth). The recursion depth determines how far the crawler should recursively examine the references of an object. Regardless of this setting, the ObjectCrawler always performs a width search, i.e. referenced objects are only examined after all siblings of an object have been examined. The last and most important option is the REP start index, which tells where the object crawler is located when searching the database. The crawler searches the database in such a way that it takes a single object from each REP and examines it to get a clear and meaningful picture of the database as quickly as possible. This so-called REP start index determines the current (start) index of this object extraction from the REPs. -1 lets the crawler take a random element from each REP, but if you want to do a full scan, you should start at 0 and observe the increment of this value to know where the crawler is at that moment. If this value exceeds the maximum length of a REP, the crawler is automatically stopped and you have thus scanned the entire REP. Under the runtime options you can limit the crawling duration of the object crawler. By default you let the crawler run until you stop it (the cancel button in the progressbar window closes the search with EndTXN and therefore the button is more a stop button than a cancel button) or until it is finished. You can stop the crawler automatically after the first run by selecting the option with the same name or only when the queue with all REP objects from the first run including their referenced objects is processed and empty by selecting the corresponding option Stop crawler when queue is empty. Depending on the selected option, you can control the behaviour in case of errors. In this sense, errors are not InstantView errors but logical consistency errors in the database. It is recommended to select the option Log error and continue. Under other settings you can define various options like: ObjectCrawler logging: all ObjectCrawler operations are written to separate log files. Process backreferences intelligently: if this option is selected, certain class checks are performed when examining backreferences to prevent errors.

        "output": "English:meta object: A meta object represents a group of identical or similar objects of an application solution. It is similar because different objects, for example of the same class \"CX_CUSTOMER\", can differ from each other by the number and type of data fields. Nevertheless, such \"similar\" objects are combined in the meta model to form a meta object \"customer\". This meta-object is then described by the totality of all possible data fields. Meta-Objects are created exclusively by the ObjectCrawler. Identification of a meta-object: A meta-object is primarily identified by its type. The type is the class name (for example, CX_CUSTOMER) of the objects. A further identification feature is the specification of the main object. Main objects are objects that are registered in a RootEntryPoint-Collection (REP Collection) of the respective class type. Thus all main objects can be identified directly and assigned to the corresponding meta object. Thus, each customer object can be identified by specifying \"type=CX_CUSTOMER and main object=yes\". But now there are also slave objects in the database which are not in a REP collection and therefore are not main objects. These slave objects are referenced/defined/identified via their master. The master is itself a meta object and references/defines/identifies other meta objects as slave objects. This is to be distinguished because slave objects (can) have a different character in the application solution due to different assignments. This becomes clear with the example of the class CX_LINK_TXN. Objects of this class can be used as order items, delivery note items or any other document items. In order to identify an order item as a meta-object, the type (=CX_LINK_TXN), the identification main object (=no) and the specification of its master are necessary. The type of the master object is in this case CX_SALES_ORDER and e.g. in case of a delivery note item CX_DELIVERY_NOTE. The set of rules according to which the master object of a slave object is defined is stored in the ObjectCrawler. Some of the rules are listed below as examples: In addition to the normal slave objects, there are also the data cube objects (of type CX_DATA_CUBE / CX_LOG_CUBE), which are not defined by a master object but by their dimensions. As dimensions there are at least two master objects. A two-dimensional data cube is therefore identified by the fact that there are exactly two unique references (dimension 1 and dimension 2) to other meta objects. Exceptions are made for data cubes that represent monthly or annual accounts. Here there is a \"correct\" dimension and a dimension representing the time span (\"year\", \"month\").

All parts which are specified in the bill of material item list on the purely MRP assembly are therefore moved from the higher-level bill of material below the new entry. To create a purely MRP assembly, the system starts from the production role to be inserted in between, creates a purely MRP entry there and selects the bill of material with its items from the higher-level bill of material. This purely dispositive entry is then visible both in the initial production roll and in the production roll of the intermediate part. Attention! A purely MRP assembly is not visible in the normal production BOM display: In the dispositive manufacturing structure, the purely dispositive assembly \"Test3\" appears in the end. For this part a part request item is also created. The parts cx0005 and cx0006 are then arranged below it. An MRP assembly defined by the master is a production part that does not have its own BOM and contains entries from other, higher-level BOMs in another production part in the \"MRP product structure\" list.(See here for technical pattern or here for further description). Instructions for setting up intermediate stages in variant parts lists: Here is a guide to setting up intermediate stages (purely MRP assemblies) in variant parts lists, which are only to apply to certain versions of the variant part, i.e. to certain sub-parts. These instructions are step-by-step, so it looks more complicated than it actually is. Step 1: First of all, all the subparts for which an intermediate stage is to be created must be selected: Step 2: The intermediate stage must be created as a variant part. Step 3: Creating the new production roll We create a production role for this new variant part, select no parts list and save. Then we insert a purely MRP assembly via the \"Create\" button in the \"MRP product structure\" group. We confirm the question with \"Yes\". In the newly opened window, we press the button \"Parts list\" and search for the parts list that belongs to the finished variant part in the search list that appears. Double-click on the entry found; it is then transferred to the small window of the purely dispositive assembly. We enter the reference quantity of 1 piece and save the new purely dispositive assembly. After saving, we can now drag all the BOM items of the original BOM into the lower item list. To do this, press the button next to the parts list. A parts list tree opens. The top level in this tree is to be expanded and all the sub-items that can now be seen are to be dragged individually into the list. Attention: The conditional items must also be dragged into the list as they are, NOT JUST A CERTAIN EXPRESSION of them! Then save with OK. Step 4: Enter the condition in the MRP assembly. Now the dispositive assembly is marked out in the parts list of the painted variant part for all subparts. However, we want this assembly to be valid only for our three versions, so we have to switch to the \"Condition\" tab in the window of the purely dispositive assembly, tick Condition and enter a formula in the formula field. This formula is composed as follows: 1 Part: Get the numbers from the corresponding data fields (different for BOMs, stock order items and preliminary parts costing). 2nd part: Comparison of the determined number with our sub-part numbers. Here, the numbers of the painted and unpainted subparts must be specified as shown in the example below! Formula: Step 5: Creation of the production rolls for the lacquered lower parts So that the sub-parts that have received an intermediate stage do not receive the complete routing of the entire construction stage on the top level (in which there is only the unpainted part), these sub-parts must still receive their own production role on which we only need to overwrite the routing. So we open the painted variant part, then open the editing mask of the subpart by double-clicking on the corresponding subpart, select the menu item \"Edit->Part Rolls->Production Data\", then change the number in the production role mask of the variant part and save. When saving, an important question appears asking whether the production data should apply to the sub-part. Be sure to answer the question with \"Yes\". Now a new production role has been created for the bottom part. We click with the right mouse button on the entered routing and select the entry \"Create\". The editing screen for the new routing opens, which immediately receives the number of the lower part. It can be saved immediately. Then insert the new routing item \"Final painting\" and save it. Now the number of the routing can be noted and the mask closed. The production role is now connected to the new routing and can also be closed. Back to the part master mask. The next sub-part is marked and a production role is inserted. The routing that we have just created is now also searched for here via the \"Routing\" button, selected and connected by subsequently saving it. The same applies to the third sub-part with intermediate stage."

In this section we will look at foreign languages and describe how multilingualism is handled in the CyberEnterprise business OS.

The operating language is the language in which the screen masks are displayed and the machine is operated. It is possible to change the operating language during operation. This is done via the buttons with the country flags ( ): All language-dependent elements (menu labelling, buttons etc.) automatically adapt to the selected language. German and English are implemented as operating languages by default. Further languages can be added as required using the Text Literal Browsers for system messages and user texts. The document language is the language in which texts are entered and output. In principle, the document language is independent of the operating language, i.e. with an operating language set to \"German\", i.e. with a \"German\" user interface, it is possible, for example, to enter an offer with English texts. Multilingual user interface: Texts for graphical user interface (GUI) elements can be created in source code within the CyberEnterprise business OS.

        "output": "English:Object Query: Based on SQL (Standard Query Language), this module can be used to query data from the object-oriented database of ClassiX®. A common use of SQL is to output certain data fields (using the SELECT statement) from a table (specified with FROM) as a result list under certain conditions (specified with WHERE). Similarly, a list of objects can be selected in this module from which data can be output (FROM \"REP collection\"). The objects of such a list belong to a certain class or a class inherited from this class. Therefore you have to consider which (\"SELECT\") data fields you select, furthermore you can query any free data fields (slots) from the objects. Due to the use of an object-oriented database, the selected data fields - nested within themselves - can be references (POINTER or REL_1M) to other objects. This module supports the construction of such data access paths by simple navigation to the referenced classes, such as reference_to_object_1.reference_to_object_2.reference_to_object_3.target_data_field_in_object_3 (the individual references are connected with \".\" each other). Since such access paths can also contain function or method calls, the classes also output their methods. Once you have selected your (\"SELECT\") data fields, you can further specify the selection of data to be displayed by a (\"WHERE\") specification, which must be specified here in the form of a query expression or InstantView® script.

        "output": "Object Web Crawler: The object web crawler runs through the database and automatically creates data connectors for the objects found. The data connectors then receive data fields matching the objects, so that in the end the data fields of a data connector represent the superset of the used slots and members of all objects of this data connector. A detailed description of the crawler's logic can be found in the technical documentation. Input window: This window is used to configure and start the crawler. Implementation: The object web crawler searches the database for objects and creates data connectors to the found objects and books the slots and members of the objects as data fields in the data connectors. The crawler always starts with the objects of the Root-Entry-Point Collections (REP) and follows all references to other objects starting from these objects. The crawler starts with the objects that were in the queue when it was started. All objects found from them are added to the queue and processed object by object. As soon as the queue is empty, the objects of all REPs with the REP start index are added to the queue and the processing of the queue starts again. After the queue is processed again, the REP start index is incremented and the process starts again until the highest index of the largest REP is reached. Since all objects for a REP start index must always be processed first and already processed objects are ignored, the effect occurs that the processing of the first REP index takes a very long time and the remaining indexes are then processed very quickly. This effect can be significantly mitigated by deselecting the option REP objects in queue. The basic procedure of the crawler is thus outlined. However, there are some additional rules and special cases, which will be considered separately in the following subsections. Main and auxiliary data connectors: Not all objects are equally interesting for reports and evaluations. There are certain objects that you can search for and over which you would run evaluations, so-called main objects. Other objects can only be reached via these main objects and are never considered separately. The main criterion for a main object is that it is in a REP. Furthermore, objects of the classes on the whitelist are also main objects. Objects on the blacklist are of course not main objects even if they are in a REP. For main objects data connectors are created in the REP of the data connectors. These data connectors are then also called main data connectors. For auxiliary objects, data connectors are created hierarchically below the main data connectors, which are then not stored in the REP of the data connectors. These auxiliary data connectors are therefore only accessible via the main data connectors, just as the corresponding objects can only be accessed via the main objects. It is possible that a certain class appears both as main and auxiliary data connector. This state occurs when the objects of the class are stored in the REP by default, but individual objects are deliberately not registered in the REP. Black- and Whitelist: The algorithm for determining the main and auxiliary data connectors needs fine tuning for some types. On the one hand there are classes for which no data connector at all should be created, on the other hand some objects should be considered as main objects although they are not in any REP. For these adjustments there are the blacklist and the whitelist. On the black- and whitelist there are classes. All objects that belong to these classes or to classes derived from them are considered to belong to the corresponding list. The blacklist describes objects for which no data connector is to be created. If a reference to such an object is posted as a data field, only the referenced type is set, but no data connector is created. The blacklist contains the following classes: The whitelist describes objects for which a main data connector should be created even if they are not in any REP. The whitelist contains the following classes:. Finding the right main object: Due to the way the crawler works, that it simply runs through all links to other objects from the objects of the REPs, the path it has taken to an object is not necessarily the shortest or semantically correct one. Therefore, for each auxiliary object the matching main object and the path between both must be searched for. For this purpose, all slots and members are assigned costs. The costs are designed to be lower if the path is potentially semantically ascending in the model. The costs are listed in the following table. On the one hand the costs for the path taken by the crawler and on the other hand the costs to all accessible main objects are calculated. The path with the lowest costs and the corresponding main object are then assumed to be correct. Wrapper: No data connectors are created for wrappers themselves. Instead, data fields are created as if they were directly referenced to the wrapped objects. In addition, data fields are created for the members and slots of the wrapper with the prefix of the actual member or slot. So you can see later which slots have been added or overwritten by a wrapper. Attribute Tables: No data connector is created for attribute tables. Instead, the attributes contained in the table are posted directly as data fields with the prefix of the member or slot. Thus, one can see directly in the data connector which attributes are contained in the referenced table. Accounts: For accounts that appear in a REP, a main data connector is normally created. For all other accounts no data connector is created. Instead, the members and slots of the account are posted directly in the data connector as data fields with the prefix of the referring member or slot. Post-processing: As soon as the actual crawling process has been completed, the data connectors are post-processed. This post-processing can also be called up manually via the menu and includes the steps specified in the following subsections. Creating partial access paths for long access paths: If an access path contains several steps, a separate data field is created for each of these steps if it does not already exist. It is tried to determine the type of the data field, the type of the referenced object and the name automatically using the information from DDI or slots. If this information does not exist, the access path to the objects of the data connector is evaluated and an attempt is made to determine the information about them. Furthermore, referenced main data connectors are automatically linked to the new data field. If no name has been found for the data field so far, the name of the data connector is used for the data field. Calculation of the distance of a data field: For each data field, the length of the access expression is stored in the associated.counter slot. This length describes the number of steps in the access expression. Create a data field CX_KLASSE::this for each data connector: For each data connector a data field is created with the access expression CX_KLASSE::this, which refers to the data connector itself. Performance Optimization: Each database and each requirement for the crawler is different, so it is not possible to specify a unique best set of parameters for all databases. At this point, however, we will describe the parameters that mainly affect performance. The parameters usually result in fewer objects being examined, but they should still reflect the overall picture. However, it should be clear that a reduction in the number of objects examined will potentially make the crawling result less accurate. Recursion depth: The recursion depth indicates how far away an object is from a REP object, i.e. how many references must be run to get to this object. If there are more steps than the recursion depth, the object is not processed. A high recursion depth results in heavily nested data connectors. If a lot of nested data is used, for example subitems of subitems in orders, the recursion depth must be set higher. A value of -1 disables the recursion depth check. Maximum collection depth: The maximum collection depth specifies the maximum number of objects in a collection to be examined. If there are always similar objects in a collection, a high collection depth reduces the performance drastically without a gain in knowledge. However, if there are always different objects in collections and they are not all examined, some characteristics are not posted as data connectors. In this case the value can and should be set lower the more similar objects within the same collection are. A value of 0 ensures that all objects in a collection are always considered. Transaction splitting: The transaction splitting specifies after how many examined objects the current transaction should be completed and a new one started. The completion of the transaction ensures on the one hand that intermediate states are permanently stored in the database and on the other hand prevents the effect that the system slows down with too many changes within a transaction. However, closing transactions too often also slows down the system. The statistics are always updated when the transaction is completed. REP objects in queue: This option controls whether REP objects reached during crawling should be queued or not. If REP objects are inserted into the queue, the effect is that almost all objects of the first REP index are reached and the processing of the first index takes a long time and the other indexes can be processed quickly because most of the objects have already been analysed. But this also causes the queue to become very large and therefore slow. If the option is deselected, the work is better distributed over the REP indices and the queue does not grow very large. If the whole database is run through anyway, selecting or deselecting the option does not affect the result, since all objects of the REPs are run through anyway. However, if only a single REP index is run through or only single objects are examined, unchecking the option would mean that reached REP objects are not examined. The recommendation is therefore to deselect the option if the whole database is searched and to select it if only a part of the database is to be searched.

It should be noted that the specification of the layer is only relevant for ClassiX® and is not relevant for ObjectStore. The uniqueness of an address results from segment, cluster and offset alone. The last part, Size, indicates the mapping size (in hex). This is 64 KB by default, i.e. 10000.

There is a general display mode for the objects, but if required, it is also possible to switch to correspondingly optimised displays for special circumstances. Navigation: In the three-dimensional world of the Object Navigator, navigation with the mouse is possible. By holding down the left mouse button the objects can be rotated, by holding down the right mouse button they can be moved. Zooming in and out is possible with the mouse wheel. Using the context menu of the right mouse button an object can be centred, i.e. rotation with the left mouse button uses this object as centre. It is also possible to edit an object or call up the object inspector via the context menu. The remaining menu items in the context menu correspond to the options in the Control Module. A double click with the left mouse button on an object expands it, thus displaying the context of the object. The object automatically moves to the centre of the display. In this way a path can be followed step by step, i.e. it can be \"wandered\" through the database. An object can be selected with a simple left click. This object is then highlighted. Landscapes: The display modes of the Object Navigator, which have been specially optimised for a particular situation, are called \"Landscape\". It is possible to switch between the landscapes at any time. From the point of switching, all newly added objects are displayed in this landscape. To make this possible, a starting point for the landscape must always be selected before switching (this is done by using the left mouse button). Not all landscapes make sense for all objects.

This document is therefore always the successor of an order. The processing of this type of table of contents is carried out parallel to the delivery notes, because the documents are usually not an order item or refer directly to such items, if the parts to be documented only appear in the parts list, for example. Creating and editing a customer documentation directory: Creating a customer documentation starts with the selection of the order for which the documents are to be made available to the customer. If one skips this step and continues directly with the creation of the items, the order is automatically assigned by selecting the items. The position of the customer documentation is usually generated automatically. The entire order or a selected order group or item is searched for documents. In addition to the order items, the production parts lists are also searched. An item is created for each item to be documented. If an article is found several times in different order items or bills of material, these are all assigned to one item as predecessors. Several documents can also be assigned to the item. In the \"Execution\" group, a workstation can be assigned to the directory, which is responsible for compiling the documents. When the document is posted, this task is posted to its worklist. By setting the \"completed\" indicator, the status is advanced and the task is booked out of the worklist again. The directory can be printed from the customer documentation. There are usually two types of documents available for this purpose. On the one hand, this is the customer documentation directory for the customer, which clarifies the assignment of the documents to the order items/articles and on the other hand, this is a picking list for order picking, i.e. the compilation of the documents.

Input window - text block: This window is used to maintain text blocks of the customer documentation. Define characteristics: If the customer documentation has variant document references, the specification (usually the language and possibly other attributes) is queried before printing or exporting. This is done via this window. Optionally, an alternative can be specified. This value is used if the variant document reference does not have a sub-document reference in the first value. In this way, English could be selected as an alternative if there is no document for the first language. The attributes that are necessary for the specification of the variant documents are listed in the window. The values are proposed based on the attributes from the customer documentation and the predecessor of the order. List window: This window is used for listing .

Functionality: This window is used to maintain quotations/orders. You can select an offer/order by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". Input window: This window is used to maintain quotations and orders. You can select an offer/order by entering the number of the desired document in the \"Number\" field and confirming with RETURN. You can recognise the type of document (offer, sample offer, order) on the one hand by the name of the window and on the other hand by the picture which is next to the number field. List window: Serves to list the offers / orders. In the menu \"Edit\" you can either select whether you want to check the units of all items or whether you want to check the correctness of all industrial plants contained in the offers/orders. However, these checks are rather technical and not intended for commercial work. In the list window of the orders you can also set whether you want to have \"empty\" or infinite data fields displayed when searching for date periods, i.e. searching for the delivery date, staging date or the technical release date. If the option is activated, then when searching for any date period, you will also be shown all documents for which the corresponding data field is empty. For this reason this option is deactivated by default!. Optionally select groups: Please select the desired optional groups from the list, which are to be included in the order including all under positions and groups. If optional groups are nested (i.e. there is another optional group under an optional group), each group must be selected separately. If you do not select any groups, no optional group is applied. Selection window: This window is used to select an offer/order. Window: Set dates: This window is called up via the menu \"Edit -> Items -> Set dates\". In the header of the window, the desired date fields can be activated and filled in by means of a checkbox. In the list, the positions to which the dates are transferred are displayed. The process is triggered via the OK button. The fields can be locked individually by message blocking users. See Security for Window: Setting Appointments. Window: Edit condition description: Double-click on an item inserted in the order to open this window. In the OLE box, the Word document describing the condition and which is printed in the document is displayed in the preview. The Word document can be edited by double-clicking in the OLE box. Important: When editing the description via this way, only the condition of the order is changed, not the master condition. The editing is completed with OK. In the list of conditions a symbol is displayed in the column \"Word\" if the order condition has an individual description. Document presets: Use this window to set document preferences for quotations and orders. The document settings can be assigned to a user, cost center, client, or partner function, for example. Change offer/order settings with Wizzard: With this wizard, settings can be set for a group of selected offers / orders in one. The selection of the offers / orders can still be changed while the wizard is open. The checkboxes in front of the groups \"Business field\" and \"Type\" can be used to show or hide the data fields. Data fields that are shown are changed in the quotations/orders by the wizard. These groups are not changed by hiding them. Offer: New offers can be created directly from the industrial plant or a project. The advantage of this procedure is that relevant data (customer, contact person, .) are directly transferred and the cost unit is correctly linked. It is also possible to simply open, fill and save an empty editing mask. If no project has been assigned to the offer at this point, a new one will be created automatically. The quotation number is consecutive and is assigned automatically when the quotation is created. After the offer data (header data) has been entered completely and the items have been created, the offer must be booked. This is done by switching the traffic light from red to green. Only now the offer is calculated once and can then be printed with the correct prices. In the ' Calculation' tab, the individual items are displayed with their purchase and sales prices (if available). By means of various selection options you can, for example, also provide the offer with a fixed price and/or hide the prices of the individual items for the customer. The customer then only receives the fixed price or the total amount as the offer price. Offer versioning: If already submitted offers are revised again, a new version of the offer can be created. In this way a history/tracking of the offer versions is possible. The end of the processing chain of the offers is represented by the final status. Either a quotation is lost if there is no order or it is converted into an order. In offer versioning, the counter controls the number of the new offer. There are two possibilities. On the one hand, the counter can be created with the step size 1. This means that the new offer version simply gets a consecutive number. The reference between the quotation versions is then only guaranteed via the document history. Another possibility is to create a counter with a larger step size. The recommended increment is 10 or 100. If this is the case, each new offer receives a number ending in \"00\". If a new offer version is created, no \"new\" number is assigned but the number of the last version is increased by one. For example, quotation 04301200 is followed by versions 04301201, 04301202, 04301203. In this example 100 versions of a quotation can be created. If you can manage with less, the increment of the counter can also be set to 10 or 5. Convert offer to order: To convert a quotation into an order you can convert it with 'Convert quotation into order'. The quotation number now appears as the order number and the previously entered data, such as customer, conditions and items are transferred to the order mask. The transfer of some data, such as the letter, can be controlled via the option window. By entering a confirmation date in the job mask, the status of the job is changed from \"not confirmed\" to \"confirmed\". Rules when converting: When converting quotations into orders, hourly records already recorded for service provider groups and their subitems are detached from the service provider group of the quotation and attached to the newly created service provider group of the order. In this way, all hourly records of a service provider group can be found together again. Likewise, all work orders created for the quote service provider group are reassigned. The entire process is now attached to the order. It is also possible to freely combine offers with other orders as successors. This function can be used, for example, if one or more orders have arisen from a general offer. The connection is called up via the menu item \"Connect with order successors\", whereupon an order can be selected via the selection mask of the orders. After selecting the order, you can see in the document history that the connection has been set. Mission: The structure and preparation of orders is identical to that of offers. If an order was created from an offer, not only the header data but also the items were transferred. Components of the offer/order: The structure of an offer is more or less determined by the tabs of the editing mask. Thus, the components of the offer order, each of which represents a separate block in the document, are as follows:. Framework contracts and call orders: Framework contracts are defined by means of a cost revenue and the individual quantities are called up by means of a sales order. See also: Framework contracts and call orders. Copying of entire offers and orders: Note: Since copying entire quotations or orders also copies all other existing data, such as characteristics, customer etc., errors may occur if existing data is not changed. It is therefore advisable to test the order flow first and to copy only one error-free order further. If you still want to copy a complete quotation or order, click on the first line of the item overview, which also contains the quotation or order number, and drag it into the 'Copy buffer' window. If you then drag this line again into a new quotation or order, the complete quotation or order is taken over. Note: If the quotation or job cannot be expanded in the copy buffer, copying cannot be performed without errors. Please repeat the process. Release order / order item: Once an order has been created and can be processed by subsequent departments, the order must be released. This release can be done for the complete order, but it is also possible to release only individual items or parts of an item. The release of all order items is done via 'Release' on the Conditions card. If only individual items or individual parts are to be released, each individual item or individual part must be double-clicked and released there via 'Release' for the following departments. Calculation, pricing: The exact functionality of calculating and pricing is explained in the documentation of the offer and order items. A special feature must be noted here, namely that discounts and packaging surcharges entered in the offer or order header always refer to the discountable or packable sum of the respective offer or order, even if the option \"from the value of goods\" was set in the corresponding condition!. Quotation costing: Target1 vs. target2 The target1 represents the order or the offer from a commercial point of view. The offer, on which an order is based, reflects what has been offered and sold to the customer, including pre-calculated costs and prices. However, since the order is also characterised by technical information, it is of course quite possible that the data of the order may change in the course of the technical processing. In this way, the costs in the order (target2) also change. Therefore it is all the more important that the target1 costs are frozen by the offer. (The freezing of the order values is also possible by converting the order into a quotation). (see here). Order costing: The calculation of the costs of an order is defined by four variables, the target1 / target2 costs, the planned/actual and the actual costs. Please refer to the definitions to find out what is behind these terms. All three values have a decisive share in the accompanying order calculation. and the success of a project. Thus the target1 / target2 costs serve the planning and preliminary costing of an order in order to achieve the desired margin in the end. The planned/actual value is an important indicator for the achievement of this goal and the actual values can be used to check the achievement of the goal. The plan/actual represents a forecast of the actual costs. For the calculation of the plan-actual, on the one hand the target2-costs are used, which are gradually replaced by the valuation of the successors (Gozinto, order), even before the actual costs have been incurred. Please refer to the following table for the formation of the planned/actual data. By the number of items for which the planned/actual is no longer formed over target2, weighted with their value, a degree of accuracy of the planned/actual in percent can be created. Detailed information regarding the accompanying job costing can be found here in a special topic. The order item category is relevant for creating planned/actual costs on set items. For some categories, the costs of the sub-items are passed on to the higher-level item, for others not. See the order item documentation. A further feature in job costing is the variance analysis, in which the planned/actual costs are compared with the actual costs. Calculation of marginal costs: The \"normal\" job costing is based on the target costs (target 1 in the quotation and target 2 in the job). The target costs are calculated including the overhead costs, which can be stored in the production part or globally at the client. With the optional marginal cost calculation, a quotation/order can also be calculated additionally only under consideration of the variable costs. This enables the sales department to determine the absolute lower price limit of an order. In marginal costing, overhead is calculated for each order item and cumulated for the groups and the entire order. The marginal costs of the order are thus calculated from the target costs minus the cumulative overheads. Marginal cost calculation can be activated for individual jobs via the options menu. An automatic presetting of the marginal cost calculation for quotations/orders can be done via the client. The default setting is stored depending on the type of order, as the marginal cost calculation only makes sense for example for new installation orders, but not for spare parts orders. Recipient/delivery address: The recipient and the delivery address defines where the ordered goods are sent to. Since this does not always have to be the customer of the order, the shipping address (recipient + delivery address) can be structured as follows. Stopping and cancelling orders / order items: Type of entry: The documents can be cancelled or stopped via the menu items Further processing->Cancelled or Stopped. After selecting the menu item, a date field with the corresponding description appears in which the current date can be entered automatically. This can be changed and deleted manually. If the date is deleted, the cancellation or the stopped status is cancelled again. If one of these interruption types is selected, all sub-items are run through and rebooked. As a result of the posting, all other status monitors such as delivery status, billing status and planning status disappear. These items receive a new confirmation status that is set to the correspondingly selected interruption type. If the order is cancelled, the item is no longer included in the calculation and is no longer taken into account in the overall price calculation of the order. The items can never have a confirmation status and at the same time one of the other statuses (billing, MRP, delivery). If the interruption is deleted, all items regain their original statuses, whereby the confirmation status is not set to active or similar, but deleted. If one of the suspension types is set, no follow-on document can be created for the corresponding items due to the missing statuses that have been replaced by the confirmation status. It is also no longer possible to carry out a sales or technical release. Definition of. .Stop: No more new documents can be created, all processes still running continue to run as before. Stopping an order item is used, for example, if technical questions/problems have occurred during scheduling and scheduling is to be interrupted for the time being. .Delivery stop: The delivery stop is used to stop delivery if, for example, a down payment has not been made. .Cancel: Same as Stop, but the prices of cancelled items are no longer included in the total sum of the order, but are treated with the value 0. The cancellation of an order can be reversed by deleting the cancelled date from the corresponding field. Import of order items from AutoCAD: In plant construction, the scope of delivery of an order is often defined in AutoCAD. For this case, ClassiX offers an interface, with which you can automatically transfer the data entered in AutoCAD into the ClassiX order processing. If changes are made to the AutoCAD drawing afterwards, the order data can be synchronised afterwards. Import The import of an AutoCAD drawing is called up via the menu item \"Product Configurator - Import - CAD\" and begins with the selection of the dwg file. The import now consists of two steps. In step number one, the file is read into ClassiX and the read data is prepared. During the import the user is informed about the status of the process. The import is completed when the read and prepared data are displayed in the import window. The representation of the data corresponds to the structure with which they are transferred to the request in the next step. The \"node\" is the position of the order below which the positions read in via CAD are created. The default setting is always the position which was selected when the import was called up. In case of doubt this is the order header. If an error occurred during reading, the corresponding items are displayed under the \"Error\" account. An error occurs if the CAD drawings contain the same position numbers for different article (numbers). Consequently, there must not be the article \"Article1\" and \"Article2\" with the same position number \"10.1\". (Attention: The equality of the attribute values is not controlled). The next step is now the generation of the order items. In this step the items are transferred to the order as they are displayed in the preview. In this step the option \"Update prices and costs\" can be set. This leads to the fact that after creating the items including the attributes, the prices and costs for each item are determined anew. Synchronisation If changes have been made to the CAD drawing after it has been read in, it is possible to synchronise the order. For this purpose, the same node must be selected when the module is called up and the same drawing must be selected. After step 1, the import of the data, now the positions are displayed with a yellow picture, which could be assigned to an order position. Assignment takes place on the basis of the last import. (If two supposedly identical items were created in AutoCAD and ClassiX, an \"equality\" is not recognized here). When generating the new items, only those items are created which have not been displayed in yellow. Unreferenced order items are displayed in the group of the same name. These are the items that exist in ClassiX below the node but have no reference to the CAD drawing. It is now necessary to check whether the reason for this is that the items were created manually in the order, or the corresponding AutoCAD block was deleted after import. In the second case the order items are likely to be deleted. The context menu supports you in this case. Notes When transferring the attributes of an order item, only the values of the attributes that were transferred via the sales item are set. If further attributes are used in the CAD drawing, these are ignored without reporting an error. If attributes of a group are taken over during the import, the first attribute with the same data field designation from the master data that does not have a value table is taken over at random. A CAD drawing cannot be imported if there are items with the same ID but which contain different articles. Hints for the creation of the AutoCAD drawing In order for the AutoCAD drawing to be imported into ClassiX, the following attributes should be set in the drawing. (In case other attributes are to be used, customer-specific changes must be made). Trade goods parts The four possibilities of transfer from the trading goods database:. Automatic determination/check of the delivery date: Note: If a provision date is determined via the replenishment lead time, the following formula is used: Provision date = Today + 1 working day + WBZ as working days. If the replenishment time is given in weeks, one week represents 5 working days. 1.1 Evaluation of the proposed delivery date Primarily, the list of order items shows the type of staging and the proposed dates. The latest (most critical) date, which has a decisive influence on the date of order provision, is also displayed separately outside the list. Import CAD drawing: (see here). Variance analysis: <->planned-actual: The variance analysis is used to compare the planned/actual costs with the actual costs. In addition, the causes of cost deviations can be determined. The variance analysis is carried out in two stages. In the first step all order items are examined for a difference between the planned/actual costs and the actual costs. Only those items which show a deviation are displayed. In the second step, the planned/actual and the actual documents can be analysed by selecting an item. As a result, all document chains are displayed in a second list, which explains the variances. By double-clicking on one of these document chains, all related documents can be listed. The grouped document chains are usually displayed via the triggering planned/actual document. This could be a purchase order, for example. In this case the following incoming invoices and incoming credit notes belong to the document chain, which are only displayed after a double click. However, the document chains are only listed if the difference between planned/actual and actual costs of all documents involved is above a certain tolerance limit. Variance analysis: target2 costs <->actual costs: All order items are listed if they have a deviation between target2 and actual costs. Not included are all groups as well as the sets whose costs are calculated from the subitems. Variance analysis: Target2-limit costs <->Actual-limit costs: All order items are listed if they have a deviation between the target 2 marginal costs and the actual marginal costs. Not included are all groups as well as the sets whose costs are determined from the subitems. Cockpit job order costing: In this window the values of the accompanying job costing can be manually overwritten and described. SOF-predecessor selection window: If a forecast (SOF) has been issued for the order in the sense of order entry planning, it must be selected here. This assignment is important so that the order/sales planning can be carried out properly. Stopping and cancelling orders / order items (technical documentation):: By setting the interruption types, the following slots are created and filled: Further dimensions must be created in the workflows of SALES_ORDER and SALES_ORDER_ITEM. In the SALES_ORDER_ITEM a new status is added: CONFIRMATION. This must be switched to EDIT_SALES_ORDER_ITEM in the transaction description via TriggeredStateMonitor (\"CONFIRMATION\").

If you press the button Insert, the position number is automatically suggested, but can still be changed. Now jump to the next field on the right, above which the currently selected article type is shown. You can change this by clicking the right mouse button above the input field. A selection list of three possible article types appears: sales article, spare part and performance unit. After one has been selected, you can decide whether this offer/order item is a \"real\" article etc. from the master data, or whether it should be a so-called text article, which practically only exists in this offer/order. A text article is created by entering any number and not confirming it with Enter. So if the input field \"Article\" below is empty, a text article is created. But if you need a real article from the trunk, you have two possibilities to select it: If you want to change an article that is displayed in this list, you can select the article in the list and drag it with pressed mouse button into the field on the far left in the quick entry \"Pos. This will cause this item to be displayed again in the fast entry and can thus be edited. Nodes in the list view: In the list view, there are different ways to display the following items. When switching from the tree view to the list view, the selected position is used as the entry point. The positions of the nodes \"Single level\" are displayed, i.e. only the direct position of the node is shown. In the sub-nodes sub-nodes existing in the node are displayed and can be selected there to go one level lower. Subnodes can be groups, items with subdivisions and service specifications items. If \"multi-level\" is selected, all items below the node are displayed. The option \"Without service specifications\" allows you to hide the service specifications items in the list.

        "output": "Offer and order position: This module is used to maintain offer/order items. Order item status: First of all, once the order item has been created, the initial status is determined by the type of provision of the part. If the part has the staging type \"no staging\", the order item does not receive the staging status and no planning is initiated during technical release. Since order items can be scheduled differently, different statuses must also be assigned. These can then be used to identify how this order item is to be further processed and where it is to be provided from. Since the type of disposition is variable, the follow-up documents already created are used as recognition for the status into which the order item is to run. There are priorities which are to be explained here: 1st case: If an order item has an exploded production bill of material as a follow-on document, the order item goes into the production status, regardless of whether it still has a requirement request or a stock backlog as a partial disposition. 2nd case: If an order item does not have an exploded production BOM, but a requirement coverage request, the order item goes into the requirement coverage request status, even if it still has a stock backlog as a partial MRP. 3rd case: If an order item has a warehouse reservation document in full order item quantity, the order item goes into the warehouse reservation status. 4th case: If the order item has no follow-up documents at all and is a text article, the order item goes to the standard disposition status set in the client, which was defined there for text articles. 5th case: If an order item has no follow-up documents at all and is not a text article, the standard disposition type of the part is taken over for the order item. So if the part is a purchased part that is subject to MRP, a requirement coverage request is created during technical release. Please note the following: The order item status only goes into \"purchase requisition\" if there is already a successor document. Before this, however, the rules (case 4+5) in the technical release window are used to determine which follow-on document must be created automatically for a technical release and which buttons are displayed as standard. In case 4+5, only the buttons of the standard disposition type are displayed in the technical release. For cases 1-3, the buttons of the planning type resulting from the follow-on documents are displayed according to the priority mentioned. Attributes in the subheadings: General Attributes are data of the order item, which take on both controlling and informative functions. The attributes can be used to break down/define the variant part that is possibly hidden behind the order item, to determine the price on the basis of a price table or to send information to the customer by printing the attributes. Local and global attributes Local attributes are created directly in the order item and can therefore be used once for this document and all subsequent documents. After creation, they can be changed in their form directly (right click) via the editing mask. Global attributes are either taken directly from the sales item or can be inserted from the attribute master. In contrast to the local attributes, they can only be edited to a limited extent. Usually this means only the value and the comment. The remaining specifications, such as changing a stored table, can only be made in the attribute master. In order processing, there is the peculiarity that not all attributes hold their value. These attributes are marked by the globe with the red tripod and are caused by the fact that at the time of inserting the attribute, a superior item has the same attribute. In this case, the attribute of the sub-item takes the value from the main item. If the value of the attribute of the main item is subsequently changed, it is passed on to all sub-items. This happens until the value of the attribute of the sub-item has been manually changed once. From this point on, the value is constant and the attribute is displayed with a globe with a yellow tripod. If the attribute values have been set to be displayed as calculated in the option window, the spontaneously calculated value of the attribute appears in the \"Value\" column instead of the formula. Supplier No. Attribute If you double-click on the attribute \"supplier no.\" or \"supplierID\", the system checks whether the value entered in this attribute corresponds to a name of a supplier and takes over the number of the first matching supplier. If none could be found, the supplier search mask opens. After selecting a supplier, the supplier number is entered in the value of the attribute. When saving an order item, the system searches for \"supplier number\" attributes on the order item that have not yet been converted into a supplier number. This is now done. If a supplier has been found, the attribute is marked accordingly and the next time the order item is saved, no further attempt is made to find it again. In requisitions and orders for parts that do not have an A-supplier, the supplier with the number specified in supplierID is used! In this way, it is possible for order parts without a main supplier to determine at the time of order entry which supplier is to be ordered from. (see also description of price determination for order items). Determining the origin of a global attribute with red tripod Determining the original attribute makes sense if an attribute inherits the value from another attribute (). If you now want to find out afterwards in which position the attribute was found, you can call up the function via the context menu. Transfer of the attributes into the order The respective red arrow shows which value is accepted and which attribute is wrapped. Calculation and quantity calculation for main and sub-items: There are five types (Types) of how subitems are assembled with the main item (see the \"Type\" field displayed on the first tab \"Offer/Order item\" if a main item has been loaded); this defines the pricing rules and quantity calculation. The types are explained using the following example (see also the explanations of the Sales Set module). Price calculation: The order processing in ClassiX not only offers extensive and variable possibilities to calculate or create prices, but also the highest possible degree of clarity. This is necessary because the price is usually not only a simple value per quantity, which is stored in the sales item, but is calculated by various factors. These factors include, for example, over/under prices, discounts/surcharges, list price-related conditions, customer group discounts and customer article group discounts. Unless a position is below a position/group with a fixed total, a slot accounted.amount is saved, in which the values of the order position can be viewed divided. The values are the following: Definitions of terms Regular price / regular price assumption When selecting a sales article role (sales article, sales set, spare part, etc.), a master sales price and master costs are transferred to the item according to the following rules: Because the attribute values in the quotation or order could be changed later, it is then ensured that the sales price or basic costs are compared with master data. There are the following possibilities: surcharges/discounts Since each item can have several surcharges and discounts, the order of the conditions is important when it comes to percentage conditions. The reason for this is that the conditions are calculated cumulatively. It should also be noted that absolute conditions (-100€) also affect the unit price. It is therefore multiplied, like all other conditions in the items, by the quantity stored for the item. List price related conditions List price related conditions can be used to hide surcharges. When the order confirmation is printed, the customer is informed of the list price, the \"normal\" conditions granted and the resulting unit price. However, he is not informed about the composition of the list price and the conditions that are included. List price-related conditions can be created in an order item as percentage or value per quantity surcharges. They are then referred to as additional or reduced prices. In an order group or the order itself, list price-related conditions can only be entered as a percentage. They are then taken into account in all items, but are not shown. Thus the surcharge is hidden in such a way that the calculation in print is also plausible for the customer. List price-related conditions in sets In contrast to the list price related conditions in an item (over/under prices), in an order group or the order itself, the application to a set item (sales set, BG set) is more differentiated. In the normal sales item position, the condition is only applied to the item itself. In the order or a group, only to the associated items. In a set with sub-items, the item category controls how the prices are calculated and therefore also the scope of the conditions. The following combinations of item category, condition type and list price-related labelling are available:. Cost calculation: Definitions of terms. Revenue calculation: Subsequent to the calculation of the whole offer/order, the revenue calculation is carried out: Revenues are calculated and stored on the individual offer/order items (and also on all other nodes such as item groups and the document itself). An item revenue is understood to be a corrected item net value, whereby the corrections take into account all other net-related conditions as well as the deviation by a fixed sum. This means that the sum of all revenue values of sub-items is always equal to the net value on the respective item. Example 1 (the simplest situation): Example 2 (fixed sum): Example 3 (total net discount): Example 4 (net position discount): Example 5 (net packaging surcharge): Example 6 (complex):. Further processing: Follow-up documents Sales and technical approval Order items are created by the sales department (on the road). Then all the background information for this job is obtained and saved. Only when the sales department knows that this order item can now be scheduled, the sales person releases the order item via the \"Sales release\". This step has the following implications: The next step is the technical release by the work preparation or the scheduler. Partial delivery A delivery schedule can be entered for an order item. These dates give you the following options Disposition An order item with a text article always receives a disposition status. An order item does not get an MRP status in the order if the item: - is a service item or - is subordinate to an assembly set item; or - is a PID item or - is a sales set item. Otherwise, the item gets a disposition status if the (possibly distinct) part on the item is a non-dispositional part. Otherwise (the part is a disposition part), the item gets a disposition status if: - the part is a purchase part or - the part is a production part and has a production role or is an assembly set. Conditional individual parts in sets: If a set contains conditional subparts, a message appears when selecting such a set into an order or quotation item, stating that at least one conditional part is present. Since the selection of conditional components depends on the characteristics specified in the item under the tab Additional Data, these must first be set accordingly. When this has been done, the button \"Generate plant components\" must be pressed, which then inserts the conditional components into the position using the set characteristics. The characteristics created in the corresponding set for a subpart are taken over. If these have not been entered, the system takes the characteristics from the parts master. Entries not relevant for an item can then be manually removed. See also the option for enabling recursive resolution. preliminary calculation: In the order position, it is possible to determine the margin or contribution margin of the position using calculatory standard prices. To do this, the standard price from the order item roll is drawn into the base cost field for purchased parts and the standard price from the production roll of the selected part for production parts. This can be changed manually to see how certain price changes affect the preliminary calculation. However, the orders or requisitions resulting from this order item remain unaffected by this change. It has no effect on the further course of procurement of the part. Trade goods parts The four possibilities of transfer from the trading goods database:. Overview: Storage reservation for a part with extra indication of a non-disposable storage location: (Techn. doc.) If a storage bin is selected in an order item that is not MRP, then the order item is not recorded in the MRP account of the part!!! Validity and last.itemPointer Each time an order item is booked, the part that is hidden behind the roll is determined and saved in last.itemPointer. This is necessary because due to attribute changes (variant parts) and validity (exchange objects) the salesItem.item object is not always the corresponding part and can be regarded as constant. The following list describes how the part (last.itemPointer) is determined. last.itemPointer is always set, even if the variant part cannot be resolved. Unless it is a text item. last.itemPointer is frozen when the order item has been technically released or has relevant successors. Relevant successors are: - Production parts lists - Stock return documents - Requisitions/purchase orders that are not a work order or have been cancelled. If after last.itemPointer has been frozen by the above-mentioned conditions, an attempt is made to change a condition that could affect last.itemPointer, the user will receive a corresponding message.

Once an order item has been delivered, it is displayed as completed. If it has not been delivered, all parts of the supply chain necessary for complete delivery are displayed with their respective status. The status of possible follow-on documents (requirement request, purchase order, goods receipt, quality assurance, return document) is evaluated for MRP order parts (merchandise), for MRP production parts the status of the follow-on documents is determined and displayed for all parts of the bill of material (exploded bill of material item, parts request, production order, purchase order documents, etc.). If an order part has been produced, then the system will also flexibly search for follow-up documents from production and vice versa. ClassiX® supports flexible disposition, i.e. purchased parts can be manufactured or production parts can be ordered (also partially). This flexible disposition is also recognised and correctly evaluated by the SCM. Exceeded deadlines are additionally marked. For stocked parts the availability is determined at the warehouse. In the missing parts list with the option \"Only insufficient parts\" only those parts in stock are displayed which are available in insufficient quantity on the requirement date. A number of options (see below) serve to quickly gain an overview of the delivery capacity and its bottlenecks.

        "output": "English:Outlook Synchronisation: With this module the contacts in a folder of Outlook can be synchronised with any contacts in ClassiX®. The basic procedure is the following: First a connection between a contact in Outlook and a contact in ClassiX® must be established. Then the contact data (business address, private address, ) is assigned to the desired fields in Outlook. This assignment can be made individually for each contact and will be used later for all synchronisation processes. As soon as there is a connection between the contacts, they can be synchronised at any time. Main window: The entire synchronisation is controlled and also started from this window. The most important part of the window is the list in which all contacts to be synchronised are displayed. Above this, it is shown which folder is currently selected in Outlook. Here, the default Outlook contact folder is selected by default. The button \"Select\" opens a dialogue with which a contact folder of Outlook can be selected. The small button next to it is used to update the list if something has changed in the Outlook folder. After selecting an Outlook folder, all contacts contained in it are loaded into the list. A symbol in front of each entry indicates what will happen in case of synchronisation with this contact. The table below provides an overview of the possible states. In principle, there are four different states. Firstly: a contact exists in ClassiX® as well as in Outlook and has already been connected. Then the contact data is simply written to ClassiX® or Outlook depending on the setting (see Options). Second: If a contact from the current Outlook folder has not yet been connected or does not exist in ClassiX® at all, then this contact has to be connected (if necessary a new person has to be created, see Connections). Thirdly: If a contact from ClassiX® is added to the list, the module assumes that it does not exist in the selected Outlook folder. During synchronisation a new contact is then automatically created and connected in Outlook (but the contact data must be connected manually, see Connections). Fourthly, a conflict has arisen in the determination of the status. This is for example the case if a contact from ClassiX® has been added to the list, which is already connected to an Outlook contact from another folder. This contact can then be reconnected by closing the old connection. This results in the following boundary condition for the synchronisation: Only folders can be synchronised. To start a synchronisation process, no contact may have the state \"Conflict\" or \"Not available in ClassiX®\". The assignment between Outlook contacts and ClassiX® contacts is user-dependent. This means that each ClassiX® user can define his own assignments, which are then saved. Since the contact data in ClassiX® are not user specific, conflicts may occur. For example, two different users could connect the same contact from ClassiX® with another contact from Outlook. If one of the users synchronises, the ClassiX® contact might contain data that the other user did not want to synchronise. Connection window: In this window you can assign an Outlook contact to a ClassiX® contact, select the contact data (telephone numbers, addresses.) to be synchronised and assign them to the fields of the Outlook contact. The ClassiX® contact and its data (name, first name .) are displayed on the left side of the window. Below this is a list containing all contact data found in ClassiX®. If nothing is shown on the left, it is a contact that exists in Outlook but has not yet been connected to ClassiX®. In this case the corresponding information is displayed as soon as a connection has been established. On the right side you can see all fields from Outlook that are synchronised. By Drag&Drop the individual contact data can now be dragged into the fields and thus be assigned. The exact assignment is left to each user, e.g. it is also possible to assign fax numbers to the telephone fields. The type is only checked for the addresses. If a contact information does not yet exist in ClassiX®, a button with which it can be newly created for the assigned ClassiX® contact. If a field is already connected, a button which can be used to undo the assignment. Connecting to a ClassiX® contact is also done by drag & drop. Any contact object can be dragged to the left side to establish a connection. You can also use the button \"Select person\" or \"Select company\" to select a corresponding contact object. If you want to create a new contact in ClassiX®, you can do so by using the buttons \"Create person\" or \"Create company\". Then a new contact object will be created and connected. With the button \"Disconnect\" (in the toolbar or on the top right of the Outlook contact) the connection between ClassiX® and Outlook is disconnected again. The button \"Cancel individual assignments\" cancels all assignments of the Outlook fields. This happens automatically when the person assignment is disconnected. With the button \"Automatically assign Outlook fields\" all fields can be automatically connected with the corresponding contact data from ClassiX®. All changes to the contact or field assignments are only accepted after clicking on \"OK\" and can also be cancelled with the \"Cancel\" button. Option window: Some settings for the synchronisation process can be made here. The first option is the master selection, which determines from where to where the contact data is written. If \"ClassiX\" is selected here, all contact data is always written from ClassiX® to Outlook. If \"Outlook\" is selected, it is the other way round. If the option \"By date\" is selected, the date of the last change on the respective page is compared with the date of the other page and the older contact is overwritten with the information from the newer one. Below this you will find the display options. If \"Current folder\" is selected here, only contacts from the current Outlook folder are displayed. However, if \"All Folders\" is selected, all contacts connected to Outlook from any Outlook folder are displayed. The check box indicates whether contacts marked as \"Private\" in Outlook should also be displayed. Only then these contacts can be connected and synchronised with ClassiX® contacts. Otherwise the private contacts from Outlook are completely ignored. Already connected contacts are always displayed, regardless of whether they are marked as \"Private\" or not. In order to remove these contacts from display, the connection must first be disconnected in ClassiX®. The last option on the left side is to define which information should be transferred from Outlook to ClassiX®. So it might not be desirable to change the data of the respective company for each Outlook contact in ClassiX®. Just activate the checkbox for the information that should be transferred. In the upper right corner you can control the behaviour when automatically connecting an Outlook contact with a ClassiX® contact. The first option controls the basic procedure, whether to try to find an already existing contact in ClassiX® or whether to create a new contact in general. The second option applies in case no contact was found during the search. In this case one can be created automatically or nothing can be done, so that a manual assignment is possible or necessary. The last option on the right side controls what should happen when a company from ClassiX® is added. Either only the company can be selected, only the employees of the company or both. The options are saved user-specifically so that each user can configure Outlook synchronization according to their preferences. Module name: olsync.mod. Classes: -.

        "output": "Outlook Synchronisation - Scenarios and Instructions. Scenarios: In the following, some scenarios, which occur more frequently when dealing with contact data, are presented and how the ClassiX® Outlook synchronisation can provide great support in each case. Import: Import here means the task to import a larger contact data stock from Outlook to ClassiX®, whereby the contacts are created in ClassiX® for the first time. Export: Export refers here to the task of exporting large amounts of contact data from ClassiX® to Outlook, whereby no contacts are available in Outlook yet. Field service: This scenario assumes the following circumstances: A sales representative is on the road with his notebook on which Outlook and ClassiX® are installed. During his field work, however, he only uses Outlook, as he cannot access the ClassiX® database in the head office. During his visits, the employee now continuously collects new contact data of potential customers or he updates the data of existing customers. All this is done in Outlook. Once a week the employee visits the company headquarters and connects his notebook to the network. Now he has access to the ClassiX® database and wants to transfer the updated or new data into the ClassiX® system. Step-by-step instructions: Here some step-by-step instructions are presented, which explain in detail how to use the ClassiX® Outlook synchronisation for frequently occurring processes. Connect: Connecting contacts is an operation that must be carried out when a contact is transferred from Outlook to ClassiX® for the first time. If a corresponding contact already exists in ClassiX®, the synchronisation module must be informed. Furthermore, not only contacts per se, but also the individual contact information must be linked to the corresponding Outlook fields. This is also the case when a contact is transferred from ClassiX® to Outlook for the first time and newly created in Outlook. Here the first mentioned case is shown, the connection of the fields in the second case is done analogously. Synchronize: The actual synchronization process is probably the most important part of Outlook synchronization. Here it is explained in detail how to start it, what problems can occur and what prerequisites must be created. Step 1:: The following requirements must be met if synchronisation is to begin:."

Appointments can be assigned collectively for these groups, which can then also be transferred directly to all subitems. It is also possible to mark groups as option groups in the offer - their costs are then not included in the total offer, these groups are ignored when they are transferred to an order. Fixed sums can also be defined on the group for all subitems. Furthermore, different recipients can be entered on the group, if, for example, a pallet with goods is to be delivered to the customer's external warehouse, or the delivery of dangerous goods has to be cleared at another gate. Status determination for order groups: Order groups usually do not have their own delivery or billing status, as the corresponding order status is determined from the items. Groups with a fixed total without subheadings are an exception. These groups can be used to sell flat-rate supplies and services via the order, which cannot be entered via an item consisting of an article or a service in a corresponding quantity. Here it does not matter what type of group (order group, service provider group, etc.) is involved. Since the statuses for such groups cannot be determined via the invoice or delivery quantity, the statuses are forwarded via the \"already delivered\" and \"already invoiced\" labels in the order groups. The corresponding fields are only displayed if the group has a fixed total but no sub-items. If items are inserted into a group which have been marked as \"already delivered\" or \"already invoiced\", the items do not receive the corresponding status.

Input window: This window is used to maintain position groups. Input window - Service provider group - Work certificate: The service provider groups, also called work certificate groups, differ from normal order groups in that an employee who is to carry out work can be entered and booked here with a planned date and a planned working time. This group thus serves the capacity planning of employee resources. It represents the planned requirements. In offers the indicator\"Reserve demand\" can be set, so that the booking of working time can be reserved already in the offer status. If an order is then created from the quotation, the quotation group is automatically booked out and from now on only the order group is booked, so that the capacity requirement is not booked twice. If the order group is deleted, the quotation group is automatically booked again. See also the topic on service provider groups and capacity planning in general Attention: The capacity of the group remains booked in the employee requirement until it receives the indicator \"Closed\"! Special features of capacity planning via service provider groups: If several successive service provider groups are scheduled for an employee and the end date of the first group is postponed due to rescheduling, all subsequent service provider groups that do not have the \"Fixed scheduling\" indicator are also automatically postponed! Service provider groups are scheduled on the basis of the capacity available to the employee. This capacity is reduced by the time entries booked on that day and by other groups scheduled for an earlier start date. The setting for capacity planning in the client plays a role here: If day-based scheduling is activated, the employee must already have specified how much working time is available to him daily in the desired period. If this has not been done, an error message is displayed during dispatching. Using this method via the client, the day-specific scheduling can even be switched off completely. Furthermore, it is possible to preset via the client whether follow-up work should generally be dynamically postponed or not. Input window - component variant group: Component variant groups are input simplifications for several identical parts in different variations. The item variant group can either be created manually via the order tree or from an existing order item via the \"Create item variant group\" button. In addition, the component variant group for textiles has a size grid which selects the size attribute of the part selected via the group, extracts the enum table from it and displays all entries as input fields. Then only the quantities (without units) have to be entered into the size fields and the positions generated with ALT-S. The entered quantities are retained even after the mask is closed, so that a quantity can be added or changed again for a size. When saving, the system checks whether there is already an order item in the size and if so, only the quantity is adjusted. Attention! When moving items from the bottom to the top in the item variant group: The order tree in the background cannot notice this change, therefore the order on the order tree remains at the old status, although the order was saved correctly! To update the list, switch to the list view once via the button and then back to the tree view again The component variant group uses a selection of characteristics of the sales article for fast processing and displays these for each item in the variant data list. The quantity and all these characteristics can be quickly adjusted for all items by double-clicking. After processing, the system must determine any existing sub-parts that have resulted from the newly set characteristics. For this purpose it is important that the group is saved before leaving. A prompt is displayed when closing the window if characteristics have been changed and not yet saved. The selection of characteristics can be changed in the group by pressing the button above the variant data list can be changed. This changed sequence is saved for the group which has just been changed. If the preselection is to be changed generally for the sales part, it can also be changed directly in the sales item role by pressing the button can be adjusted above the list of object characteristics.

This is a list of all those purchased parts for which the respective suppliers cannot explicitly provide proof of valid certificates of origin (origin EU) at the time of delivery (the value of the non-originating goods in a delivery item determines the amount of import duties for some countries). Such declarations can be made by companies acting as \"approved exporters\" by the customs authorities. Alternatively, a list of the purchased parts clearly declared as originating, as well as a list of all purchased parts - regardless of their originating status - can be issued. The following information on the origin of a product can be entered(if an identifier is no longer valid from the date - as it is older than one year - the system will place a \"?\" in front of the identifier for further verification. e.g. \"?N\"): Description Identification Original product U not originating N Reference to invoice R not specified - Requested A With regard to the country of origin, the following information can be entered(if an identifier is no longer valid from the date - as it is older than one year - the system will place a \"?\" in front of the identifier for further verification. e.g. \"?DE\"): Description Identification Country code of the country of origin DE (Germany), CH (Switzerland), not specified - Various countries are eligible #. Functionality: Processing starts by dragging and dropping the order items (or groups) for which such a proof of origin is to be created into the list window. There are two buttons (see below) to select either sales or stock order items. The items selected in this way are identified - depending on their processing in the logistical business process - as purchased or manufactured parts, and in the process as either taken from stock or directly scheduled. Thus, not only the master information of a part is assumed: A part, which may be a production part by default, could also - e.g. due to capacity bottlenecks - have been directly procured from a supplier for the order in question, i.e. an order was triggered for this part in this order item. In this case, the part is therefore to be regarded as a purchased part and no longer as a production part. It can therefore happen that a stock-keeping production part has been removed from the warehouse for an order. In order to be able to trace the origin, however, the parts list of this production part must be exploded during the evaluation to see which parts with which origin this production part consists of. Note: Please note that when evaluating the proof of origin before the start, the system-wide validity date is set either to the reference date set manually via the options, or to the creation date of the earliest invoice of the order. If an invoice has not yet been created for the order, the order creation date is used. If the evaluation is aborted, the system date will NOT be reset to the current date, please make sure to reset the system date to the current date. This is done via the main menu \"System-->Change date-->Session date\", there the field \"Validity date\". If it is determined for a purchased part on an order position that there is neither an order nor a stock withdrawal for this, an error message is issued. Similarly, an error message is issued for a production part if there is neither a stock withdrawal nor a production-specific parts list.

        "output": "English:Outlook: With the Outlook module, contacts from MS Outlook® can be synchronised with persons, contact persons and employees from the CyberEnterprise® PS database. Two different modes of use are available for this purpose: import and export mode. Which mode to use depends on the system (in MS Outlook® or in the CyberEnterprise® PS database) in which a contact is first created or already existed. If many contacts already exist in MS Outlook® or if the contacts are first created in MS Outlook®, then the import mode should be used. In this case, the contacts from MS Outlook® must be manually assigned to the corresponding objects in the CyberEnterprise® PS database via Connect, as contacts in MS Outlook® are not managed clearly separated according to (private) persons, contact persons or employees. If contact data is first created in the CyberEnterprise® PS database, it can be transferred to MS Outlook® using the export mode. General: The arrangement of the areas in the editing windows is basically divided into two, i.e. independent of whether you are in import or export mode. On the one hand, there is a list of contacts to be edited in the left area of the window, and a preview area in the right area of the window, where the relevant personal data for the individual fields are displayed in MS Outlook®. Import MS Outlook contacts into the CyberEnterprise PS database: The import mode is used to connect contacts from MS Outlook® with the objects already existing in the CyberEnterprise® PS database. In the list in the left part of the window, the contacts existing in the currently selected folder of MS Outlook® are displayed. A contact can be selected with the corresponding button and is also shown below. The two buttons 'Import Selected' and 'Import All' are equivalent to the buttons in the export mode, only this one is imported from MS Outlook®. When importing into the CyberEnterprise® PS database, please note that a contact from MS Outlook®, which was not created by exporting from the CyberEnterprise® PS database, must first be connected to its counterpart in the CyberEnterprise® PS database. For this purpose, the context menu contains the option'Connect' in addition to the items 'Remove' and 'Import'. This is only available if a connection is actually necessary, i.e. the objects from MS Outlook® and the CyberEnterprise® PS database have not already been connected previously. This is indicated by the small symbol next to each list entry. If the symbol for an employee, the symbol for a contact person or the symbol for a person, then it could already be automatically determined which contact from the CyberEnterprise® PS database belongs to this MS Outlook® contact. However, if the symbol is displayed, this connection must be established manually. When the import is started, the information about this contact is updated in the CyberEnterprise® PS database. Again, it is possible to make short-term changes in the preview area. If an attempt is made to import an unlinked contact, the Connect window is automatically displayed. After clicking 'OK' the selected person will be imported immediately. The Connect window is also displayed if a not yet linked contact is found after clicking on 'Import all'. If a contact is connected, the editing window of the selected object of the CyberEnterprise® PS database can be opened by double-clicking from the list of contacts. Connect: To manually link an MS Outlook® contact to an object in the CyberEnterprise® PS database, the menu selection 'Connect' creates this input window, containing the most basic information about the contact from MS Outlook®. Now you can drag and drop the desired object from the CyberEnterprise®PS database into the lower part of the window. After a click on 'OK' the connection is established. Export CyberEnterprise PS database objects to MS Outlook: The export mode is used to export personal, own employee or external contact data as a contact to MS Outlook®. In order to export contacts from the CyberEnterprise® PS database to MS Outlook®, they can be dragged and dropped into the list from anywhere. If you select a person, you can see in the preview area which information will be exported to MS Outlook®. Changes can be made here before the export. The small icon for each contact in the list shows whether or not it has already been exported to MS Outlook®. The symbol for an employee, the symbol for a contact person or the symbol for a person means that the export has already taken place and the symbol that this contact has not yet been exported. If a contact already exists in MS Outlook®, the associated information is only updated, otherwise a new contact is created. With the right mouse button a context menu can be displayed in the list (see below for explanation), with a double click the selected object can be edited. At the bottom edge of the window it is shown in which folder in MS Outlook® the contacts are saved. By default, the default folder of MS Outlook® is always entered here for contact data. For export you can either use the button 'Export all' to export all persons in the list to MS Outlook®. With 'Export selected' only the currently selected contacts are exported. Multiple selection is possible in the list. If a contact is connected, the editing window of the selected object of the CyberEnterprise® PS database can be opened by double-clicking from the list of contacts. Outlook synchronization module: If an object from the CyberEnterprise® PS database is connected to an Outlook contact, the slot \"outlook.number\" is entered in the CyberEnterprise® PS database object with specification of the object type and a consecutive number, which is formed by the CX_COUNTER counter of the ID \"outlook\": \"CX_CONTACT::53\" or CX_STAFF_MEMBER::102\" or \"CX_PERSON::64\". At the same time this value is entered from \"outlook.number\" in the MS Outlook® contact in the user defined field named \"ClassiX\". Module name: outlook.mod. Classes: -.

If the goods of a delivery note are divided into several packages, containers, etc., the loading list can be used to determine which package contains which goods. At the same time, the package as such is specified in the loading list item, for example by weight, size, tracking ID. The loading list can either be printed directly. However, it is also possible to print it via the delivery note. In this case, the loading list number in which the item is packed is printed behind each delivery note item. The overview of all loading list items is then printed in the delivery note footer. The forwarding order is the order given to the forwarder.

        "output": "Partners and roles: This app is used to create and delete partner-role relationships. Several roles can be assigned to each partner, e.g. a company and/or a person can have the role \"customer\" and also the role \"operator\" (of an industrial plant). Also, a person can be, for example, \"employee\" and also \"user\" (of the IT system) or a company can be \"supplier\" and also \"manufacturer\", etc.\"Partners\" in CyberEnterprise® are therefore only companies (legal entities) or persons (natural persons), these central entities are assigned e.g. addresses, bank details, private details, etc., i.e. information that is independent of the type of business relationship. The actual way in which these partners relate to you in a business relationship is defined by their role.Both companies and persons can have one or more roles. Input window: If the window is opened via a (partner) role, the second window is automatically completed. Something similar happens when opening via the partner, except that the \"Role -> Partner\" window is only filled if the partner has only one role. If this is not the case, it is hidden. By selecting a role, you can then access the \"Role -> Partner\" window via the theatre mask. Assign roles: If a company is already created in the partner administration, for example as a \"supplier\", and now also becomes a \"customer\", then you can simply add a new role to the already existing entry. To do this, select the entry in the company list and click on the role icon. Next, click on 'Create', select the additional role of the partner and add it to the existing entry with 'Select'. This automatically opens (in this example) the input mask for the customer data. Most of the data has already been taken over from the supplier entry. You can now add or change the customer-specific data in this mask. If the customer number is not assigned automatically via the register, you should assign and enter it. Then close the mask with 'OK' to save your entries. Now two roles are assigned to the company entry. If you do not see them immediately, close the mask once and open it again to display the updated list. You can edit the customer or supplier data by double-clicking on the respective role. If, for example, you have assigned the role \"Employee\" (of your own company) to a person and this person is also the contact person (possibly as a side job) of another company, then these are roles of the same type \"Contact\": \"Contact person of your own company, but also of the external company. In some masks, information about a person is filled with contact data, so it can happen that you want to influence which contact should be output there, which contact is the more important one. Since the first contact found is always output, you can also change the order of the roles with the buttons next to the list. Organise roles: The occurrence of duplicates cannot always be avoided. Especially if the company entries in the partner administration are maintained by different departments and/or employees. Even if you have taken over supplier and customer lists from another system when setting up your CyberEnterprise® , redundancies will probably have been carried along. However, you can organise these redundancies subsequently at any time and thus eliminate them. In the classic case there are creditors with debit balances, in other words suppliers who are also managed as customers. However, it is also conceivable that banks or even the tax office are also customers of your company. You can easily resolve duplicate entries and organise them correctly. First decide which existing entry you want to assign the additional role to and mark it in the company list. Banks and tax offices are a special case here: If you want to assign an additional role to them, you must select the entry that is not already assigned the role 'Bank' or 'Tax office'. Next, click on the role icon. Now you have opened the role window for the supplier entry in the example shown. Mark the role 'Supplier' and click on the icon 'Change partner'. Now arrange the two windows in such a way that you can click on the customer entry and drag and drop it into the role window. The role 'supplier', which was previously assigned to the entry with '.GmbH' in the example, is now added to the entry with '.company'. Confirm this action with 'OK' and close the role window again. The company entry '.company' now has both roles, customer and supplier, assigned as properties. The entry '.GmbH' has no role assigned and can be deleted. Module name: pcastedt.mod.

        "output": "Master data. Preparation: Before the daily work in the ClassiX® application can begin, all master data must first be created. As all these data are related to each other in the program, as in real life, it is recommended to plan the creation of master data carefully and to proceed methodically during the input. First of all, gather all your data together, bring it up to date and organise it clearly. It is advisable to prepare the data in Excel, for example, as they can then be automatically transferred to the ClassiX® application. Any other structured file format can of course be used in the same way. Since almost every software application allows the output of your data into such structured files, you can also transfer the data directly from another system into ClassiX®. Please keep in mind that the new start always offers a good opportunity to revise your master data and its maintenance. Think carefully about which data you want to transfer from where and on which level and make sure that you can provide the data in a well structured way. It is equally important that you determine how master data once created should be maintained in the future so that it is always up-to-date. For example, where in your company should new customers, vendors, cost objects, etc. be created and who can and may continue to maintain them? Will data also come from other programs in the future, so that an interface is needed to guarantee the integrity of the data and avoid double data maintenance? If you have prepared yourself methodically in this way, you will see that the start with ClassiX® is hardly easier and faster. If you are already using other ClassiX® modules, everything will be even easier, because the data already created there will not have to be created again. Likewise, master data created in ClassiX®-Office or in ClassiX®-Financial Accounting are immediately available in ClassiX®-Office or ClassiX®-Financial Accounting in case of later extensions by additional ClassiX® modules. As the data is created in stages, some of the relationships have to be maintained. For example, you can only link the tax accounts to the client data after you have created both the client and the chart of accounts. Of course, all master data can also be created manually and maintained as described in the following section of this chapter. Clients/company: When you log in for the first time in a completely new ClassiX® application, you have to confirm the login window empty, because no users have been created yet. Next you have to create the client master data, because all further data should be saved client-dependent. In the client master data, it is important to define the fields 'Number' and 'DB layer' uniquely in order to functionally guarantee multi-client capability. Number' is the client number used in the system and 'DB layer' for the physical differentiation of clients at the database level. The currency must also be entered. Address data and telephone, etc. should also be entered because the program can then refer to these correctly if necessary. Finish each field entry with the 'Tab' key and do not forget to save your entries with 'OK'. The client window contains several pages/tabs between which you can scroll by clicking on the title of the page. By clicking on 'Accounting' - or by using the key combination 'Alt'-'R' - you get to the third page where you enter which cost accounting functions you use in your company. When you have completed all the fields, you can enter further company-related data, such as bank details on the 'Additional data' tab of the new window by clicking the 'Company' button. You will notice that overlapping information does not have to be re-entered, because in ClassiX® all data is logically linked. Later, this menu item allows you to switch between several clients created in the system. User - System User: This is where the users are created who should and may use your ClassiX® applications. The login name (user ID) and password must be entered. Furthermore, the personnel number and also a time limit for the validity of the login can be added. In the lower part of the window you can also define restricted access rights. If you have just created your login here when creating a new system, please log in to the system again. Since a real person should be assigned to the login if possible, it is recommended to first create the personal data in the ClassiX® partner administration. You can also do this later. In general, however, you should keep in mind that 'user' is only the role of one person, and one person may have several roles. If you first create the person and then assign one or more roles to this person, you can avoid double entries and you will always have your data well structured. However, system users do not have to be created as persons at the same time!. Financial year and periods: After the fiscal year has been created, the periods must be generated. If these correspond to the calendar months, they can be generated automatically, otherwise please create the sub-periods individually. You must also set the status of the period to be posted to in the sub-periods to 'started'. By double-clicking on one of the created periods you can edit it. Similar to the creation of the posting periods, you can also create the working calendars. Basic data - tax rates: For the tax rates, enter the link to the corresponding tax accounts and also enter the link to your tax office after it has been created in partner management. You can also enter the tax office data immediately and then switch back to this window, as all objects created in ClassiX® are immediately available for general use. Basic data - Business conditions: Create condition with 'New': Confirm with 'OK', then via menu or right mouse button: Edit' - 'Cash discount rate' - 'Insert', e.g. 'Fixed due date Due date: 10 days - Tab - Percent: 0 A description of how to use it in the documents can be entered below:. Document management in ClassiX®: In general, your business documents are composed of several elements (document modules): Header first page (e.g. company logo, business address), salutation, footer first page, etc. They then compile a specific document from the predefined modules. You can enter the individual modules directly as text in the 'Document Module' window, but you can also create them in your standard word processing software, such as Microsoft Word. The modules can also be modular. Partner master data - companies, persons and contacts: All contacts in the ClassiX® applications see themselves as partners. ClassiX® only knows companies and persons as central information units about partners. These are assigned e.g. addresses, bank details, private data etc., information that is independent of the type of business relationship. Both companies and persons can have one or more roles, which define the business relations. For example, a person can be both employee and user, or a company can be both supplier and manufacturer. The relationships and roles can be entered as they actually are. Companies with branches and contact persons, persons with business and private addresses, etc. All data is entered redundancy-free and the relationships are clearly displayed. As in all lists, by entering the first letter(s), each entry can be found using various search fields. It is also easy to branch to related data, edit them or add or create new data. A letter or e-mail can also be created directly from here. Furthermore, the list can also be printed or loaded into the clipboard and is then available for further processing in other programs. Please note that the number of entries displayed in the company and person lists is limited in the standard setting in order to display these lists faster. If you do not find entries, this may be due to the fact that you cannot find them. If necessary, enter the first letter(s) in the search mask or increase the number of items displayed via the menu item 'Options'. Rolls: Roles are of special importance in ClassiX® applications, because they represent the relationships between your partners. Roles enable, for example, creditors who are simultaneously debtors or employees who are also system users, without double entry of data in the system. Companies and people with whom you do business are first and foremost all 'partners'. Only then are they assigned the respective roles (interested party, customer, supplier, bank, employee, etc.). If, for example, you need to create a new customer master record, you should therefore first check whether you have already created it as a company, possibly with the role 'prospect'. You can then assign a new role 'customer' to the corresponding company master data and your data will remain well structured and free of redundancies. Using the example of the roles, the advantages of the object-oriented structure of the ClassiX® applications become particularly clear. The relationships with and between all your business partners and their roles can only be depicted so realistically in the system by the consistent object-oriented concept. Thus, your master data maintenance is considerably simplified. If you create a new partner, a corresponding person or company entry is created at the same time as the first assigned role is created (the only exception is the entry as system user). That means, if a contact person is created, then this person is also entered as a person master record in ClassiX® and if a customer is created, then the corresponding company entry is made automatically. If this customer already exists, for example as a 'prospective customer', then duplicates will occur - and the relationship between the data will be lost. In this example, it is recommended to look up the company directory beforehand and, if necessary, mark the company data record there and then assign the additional property 'Customer' via the role icon. Then the window for entering the customer master data opens. You can also create the customer from here, for example, as a branch of an already registered company by clicking on the corresponding icon, then entering the company data and then setting up the role 'Customer'. If you have vendors with customer accounts, you can of course also add this additional role from the vendor master. Example of roles - Assigning the role 'customer' to a company: If a company is already created in the partner administration, for example as a supplier, and now also becomes a customer, then you can simply add a new role to the existing entry. Select the entry in the list of companies and click on the role icon. Next click on 'Create', select the additional role of the partner and add it to the existing entry with 'Select'. The input mask for the customer data opens automatically (in this example). Most of the data is already taken from the supplier entry. You can now add or change the customer-specific data in this mask. If the customer number is not assigned automatically via the counter, you should assign and enter it. Then close the mask with 'OK' to save your entries! Now two roles are assigned to the company entry. If you do not see them immediately, close the mask once and open it again to display the list updated. You can edit the customer or supplier data by double-clicking on the respective role. Organise roles: The occurrence of duplicates cannot always be avoided. Especially if the company entries in the partner administration are maintained by different departments and/or employees. Even if you have transferred supplier and customer lists from another system when setting up ClassiX®, redundancies will probably have been carried along. However, you can organise these redundancies at any time later and thus eliminate them. In the classic case, there are creditors with debit balances, in other words suppliers who are also managed as customers. However, it is also conceivable that banks or even the tax office are also customers of your company. You can easily resolve duplicate entries and organise them correctly. First decide which existing entry you want to assign the additional role to and mark it in the company list. Banks and tax offices are a special feature here: If you want to assign an additional role to them, you must select the entry that is not already assigned the role 'bank' or 'tax office'. Next click on the role icon. Now you have opened the role window for the supplier entry in the example shown. Mark the role 'Supplier' and click on the icon 'Change partner'. Now arrange the two windows in such a way that you can click on the customer entry and drag and drop it into the role window. The role 'supplier', which was previously assigned to the entry with '.GmbH' in the example, is now added to the entry with '.company'. Confirm this action with 'OK' and close the role window again. The company entry '.company' now has both roles, customer and supplier, assigned as properties. The entry '.GmbH' has no role assigned and can be deleted. Employees: In this window you can create and manage your employees. The information necessary for the company can usually be entered in the fields directly or via the menu item 'Edit'. Telephone, fax, e-mail, etc. can also be maintained by clicking the right mouse button in the field 'Business Communication'. The employees created here can also be found in the system as persons. If you want to add private data, it is advisable to do this via the list of persons. Do not forget to link the employee to the corresponding system user if necessary. For the employee, you define the validity using the entry and leaving dates. Please remember, however, that the validity of the user entry is independent of this! This must be the case, for example, because you may want to block an employee's system access before he or she leaves the company or you may want to continue to grant system access after he or she has left the company. Data entry example - Company: The input mask for entering a new company address is called up via the Company module (command Insert Company under Edit). The various company-specific communication data (address, telephone, fax, e-mail, Internet), bank details, contact persons, branch offices, etc. are entered here. Any number of communication data, bank details, contact persons, branches and search terms can be assigned to a company. It is also possible to assign one or more industries to a company (command Industries under Edit). This branch assignment is a first example of the use of structures for the meaningful organisation of your data for the later creation of overviews and evaluations. Furthermore, notes and processes for a company can be created here. Via the company list, the recorded company is assigned, for example, the business role of prospective customer and, as such, the possible role of end customer. Using these role assignments, companies can be selected for certain mailing campaigns, for example. Contact persons can then be entered from the company mask. These are then automatically created as person objects. The role of a person, as in this example the contact person of a company, is displayed with the contact person button in the menu bar of the list of persons. The contact person button can be used to determine the company affiliation of a person. Suppliers - Creditors: Creditors are called up via the menu item 'Partner'-'Suppliers' or the supplier icon. To create a new business partner, click on 'New' in the opened list. The supplier window opens, in which you can now enter the relevant data. To edit an existing business partner, double click on the corresponding entry in the supplier list. The fields in the editing windows are confirmed with the 'Tab' key. At the end all new entries are saved by clicking on 'OK'. However, before creating a new vendor, you should first check whether a company entry for this business partner may already exist in the partner administration. If this is the case, you only need to add the role 'Vendor' to the existing data record. The number range is determined internally and can be easily set up and managed via the counter. However, the number ranges of customers and vendors must not be identical and must not overlap. Enter master data: Very important: Now confirm this master data with the 'OK' button! Otherwise they will not be processed. Then continue on the page ADDITIONAL DATA: Otherwise, add the points as required by the company. Additional information can be entered either directly into the fields on the different tabs, via the menu item 'Edit' or in the list fields also via the right mouse button and 'Paste': When your details are complete, click 'New' to proceed to the next creditor. Click 'Close' to close the supplier system. Customers - Debtors: Customers are called up via the customer icon and created and maintained in the same way as vendors. Banks: Here you create your bank details. On the 'Accounts' tab, you enter your account details with these banks and create the link to the cash accounts: If you want to use the automatic payment system, then you must of course enter all data completely."

Your payments to employees, for example for travel expense accounts, can also be made from here. You can also use the selection fields to include vendors with customer accounts in the list, initiate a new list structure and include or exclude invoices with an entered payment block. The payment proposal list is then displayed for further processing with the 'Lists' button. In the payment proposal list, you can mark the entries manually, by mouse click, or via the menu item 'Select' - 'Conditional selection'. With 'Conditional selection' you can select the amount and with 'Select all' you can select all entries. With the menu item 'Delete selection' you can revise the selection made. You can then use the menu item Edit to remove the ORs you have selected from the payment proposal list. You can also remove blocked ORs if you have not yet done so in the preselection or if you have reprocessed ORs from the list. You can also add other operations to the list. You can either do that: via 'drag and drop' from the individual surgery lists, the journal or the surgery administration, or: via the menu item 'Other payment proposals'. If you want to add further payment proposals to the existing ones via the selection window again, please make sure that you do not leave the 'New structure' field in the selection window ticked, otherwise you would generate the list from scratch. Selected payment proposals can also be individually post-processed by double-clicking. The 'Fixed payment dates' click box allows you to set the due dates independently of the other dates. An internal comment can also be added to the open item in the 'Text' field. You can still lock or unlock the surgery using the 'Number lock' field. If you need more detailed information on individual ORs or even need to rework them, you can select the OR in question and then use the icons to go directly to the corresponding supplier or employee, vendor or employee account, OR management or journal entry. Of course, details such as a payment block in the OR can be changed directly there and are then immediately effective. If required, the total of the payment proposals can be displayed on the screen or the entire payment proposal list can be printed. This applies both to the selected entries and to all entries in the payment proposal list. After the payment proposal list has been completely processed, the payments are posted via the menu item 'Payment', under the respective payment type, with 'Book'. You will have to mark the payment proposals again for posting. In this way, you can choose different payment types for the payment proposals selected. The payment proposals then processed are then automatically removed from the list. If all payments are to be made via one bank or payment method, you can of course also select all payment proposals at once. Remember that an interim account must also be created for the selected bank. If the bank disk is to be created at the same time, the path must be specified in the 'File' field. If this path refers directly to the floppy disk drive, then the floppy disk must also be inserted. The processing of the payment run is then started by clicking on the 'Update' button and is completed with the printing of the accompanying slip in the case of diskette clearing. The remittance slip printing and cheque printing are carried out in the same way as diskette clearing. To ensure that the forms are correctly clamped in the printer, a test print can first be made there. The paid OPs are automatically cleared only after a successful disk clearing or after printing the remittance slip or cheques. Until then, the invoices and the offset payments remain in the open items. A possible cause for errors can be a missing bank connection in the supplier master data. If this is the case, enter them accordingly and then repeat the diskette clearing or the bank transfer or cheque printing. The diskette clearing as well as the printing of transfers or cheques can be repeated as often as required. This is also possible via the menu item 'Activities'-'Financial accounting'-'Payments' of the main menu. To do this, enter the document number of the payment run to be repeated and the corresponding period. In the repeat run, you have the option of subsequently excluding payments by selection.

For individual or several open items, the payment to be made can be edited, i.e. the discount amount as well as the payment amount (also as a partial amount) can be specified. The open items marked in the payment proposal list are then released for bank clearing (supported formats SEPA, DTAUS, MT101, DTAZV) or cheque printing, whereby the posting of the payment and the clearing takes place automatically in the financial accounting. The open items can be selected in several consecutive steps in order to pay by different payment methods (see also Conditional selection).

In the case of incoming invoices for fixed assets, any cash discount income is posted against the fixed asset account posted with the incoming invoice.

The functionality of these \"plus\" buttons is explained in general terms and illustrated using the example of the requirement request. Introduction: Basically two of the buttons shown above always belong together. As can be seen above, the only difference between the two buttons that belong together is an additional plus sign. The respective function is correspondingly: Without plus sign something new is created, with plus sign something existing is extended. Creation: The behaviour of the \"normal\" button is very simple: First of all it is checked whether items are selected in the corresponding list. If this is not the case, you will receive a message and the process will be aborted. If items are already marked, the next step is to check whether a window with a requirement request is already open. If not, you will be asked whether you want to create a new requirement coverage request with x items. If you click on \"Yes\" here, the request will be created. If you click on \"No\", the process is cancelled. If a window with a different requirement is already open, you will also receive a security query. It is pointed out that a requirement request with the number xxx is already open and you are asked whether you want to create a new requirement. With \"Yes\" this new requirement coverage request is then created. Click on \"No\" to cancel the process. Expand: First of all - as with the \"normal\" button - it is checked whether entries of the corresponding list are marked. If this is not the case, the process is aborted with a note. If entries are already marked, the next step is to check whether a window with a different stock request is open. If this is not the case, this button behaves exactly like the \"normal\" button (see above). If another requirement coverage request is already open in a window, a confirmation prompt appears asking whether requirement coverage request no. xxx should be extended. You can cancel the process with \"No\". By clicking on \"Yes\", you can extend the request by the marked items."

        "output": "Complex price or discount and surcharge: Prices Create/edit Important notes Complex price Complex discount/supplement Test prices Price history/validity list Copy buffer. Prices Create/edit: In ClassiX® there are three, for sales articles even four, possibilities to edit a price. The desired option can be selected via the context menu of the price button selectable. Important notes Before editing a price, check whether it is necessary to move the old price to the price history and create a new one. If this is not done, the pricing of old offers / orders and also orders cannot be tracked. The entry of a conditional discount/surcharge table may not have any discounts/surcharges itself. Only one price, no matter on which level, may be extended/nested. Complex price: A price can be defined as a chain of any length (mainly in master data) and then represents a basic price with increase/decrease prices and discounts/surcharges. The chain can be edited in this module in list form. The following terms are used to describe such a prize:. Example:: Price as a price scale depending on the NWIDTH feature (nominal width) plus an additional price according to the design (DESIGN feature) minus a 1% discount: (See detailed example, here the values at NWIDTH = 600mm, DESIGN=\"two air inlets\"). Complex discount/supplement: A discount or surcharge can also be defined as a chain of any length, in which case the first link does not differ in its functionality from other links. Example: discount -3% - 1% + 1,00 € A result of this complex price can be tested via the lower part of the window as described below. Please note: Prices with conditions are calculated in the orders as follows: Unit price * quantity + conditions = total value Example: 5,50 € / 1 piece * 20 pieces + 15 % = total value. Test prices: To test prices with conditional discounts or generally conditional prices, it is possible to add object characteristics to the object characteristics list. In this way, the price can be tested for different constellations and quantities. Only the price per unit is always displayed, which is the total sum resulting from the entered quantity and unit price! (Example: Maybe the price per unit will change if you want to buy 100 pieces) The attributes are saved in a temporary data field on the price and are therefore available unchanged the next time the user enters the price. If the characteristics are to be determined again from the owner, the adjacent button must be pressed. All characteristics are then deleted and redrawn from the owner. If it is a part roll that does not have its own material characteristics, they are drawn from the main part. Price history/validity list: If a price changes in the course of time, you can of course simply overwrite the old price. In this case, however, it is the case that you do not have an overview of how the price has developed over a period of time. To be able to record this movement as well, the prices can be provided with validities. You don't just double click on the price and change it, but press the \"New\" button at the bottom of the window. A small menu opens, which offers the possibility to create an exact copy of the price. The old price is invalidated by the validity date and the new one is set as currently valid. Now you can change the new price and see how this price has developed in the validity list. The following example shows a possible price history: It is shown here that the price from 17.04.2003 to 20.04.2003 was calculated from a price table, which was also clearly broken down here. On 21.04.2003 this price has changed so that always a price with a discount (10%) was valid. Whether the discount is based on list price or net can be seen in the list. The blue heading tries to show the price in its completeness. If this is not possible due to complex prices, only the heading Price table is displayed, followed by a complete breakdown. The individual links of a price chain are shown in green. Next to price tables are the \"unfolded\" symbols, followed by a breakdown of the individual prices and conditions. By double-clicking on the blue line, the editing window will open, allowing you to edit this price. When creating a new price with new validity - manually in individual cases or automatically during a price increase run - the plausibility of the price history is checked by checking whether the validity of the new price overlaps with the validity of an existing price. If this is the case, the price change is terminated with an error message. The validity of the prices can also be changed via the editing window of the prices. Here the plausibility of the prices is also checked. The message of the overlapping of two price validities is only displayed as a warning message, so that the validity of the price that is not currently being edited can be adjusted if necessary. Copy buffer: Using the copy buffer, which can be called up from the menu, individual discounts or surcharges can be copied into other prices of other parts. However, the main price cannot be copied because there can only be one in the list and this cannot be deleted from the list. In this way, complex discount price tables can be copied very quickly. Input window: This window is used to maintain complex prices or discounts/surcharges. Editing window of prices and costs: Processing of costs and prices This window is very similar to the input window described above, except that wherever the value is displayed or edited, one (purchase cost for a purchased part) or two (standard cost of material and labour for a manufactured part) cost fields are displayed simultaneously. Which cost fields are displayed is controlled by the logistics indicator. The part roles, which are responsible for the costs and prices, are also displayed in the module. The prices and costs can then be edited directly from the module. In doing so, the editor should note that he directly changes the data of the roles. When switching the price type (value per quantity, formula, percent, table), the price/cost type of the roll is also changed automatically. If different price/cost types are found, the user will be informed by two red dots. The red text also indicates the different value types. Creation of price tables for costs and prices: This module offers the simplest way to create price tables for costs and prices, as prices are usually linked to the same conditions as costs. Normally the agent would go into the sales role and create the price table and do the same for the material and labour costs of the production role. He would therefore have to create three almost identical tables. Using the module for parallel editing of prices and costs the following steps are sufficient. First of all, the type of the prices must be set to \"Table\". Then the button can be used to open the module for editing a price table. The columns are created identically to the \"normal\" price tables. The only difference is that in this price table there is not only the column for the price but also the column for the costs. In the background, the step that only has to be done once here is automatically carried out for all price and cost tables. So you can go back to the parts roll and you will only find one (the normal) price table here. Price history: This window displays the price history. Price history: Graphic display of the price development. Simulative price-cost comparison: Through this window it is possible to compare sales prices and costs of a part where the structure of the complex pricing is different. Option window: Use the option window to set the default settings. If, for example, prices of several articles are changed and the new price is always only valid from the turn of the year, the changeover date, which is preset with the session date, can be overwritten.

If this is not the case and the attribute is also allowed to be missing, then another security query would be built in, such as:. 2. price as conditional table: Example 2.1: Volume graduation: PRICE = 449,00 €, from 10 pieces 439,00 €, from 20 pieces 420,00 € The price is created as a conditional table and the data is entered as follows: In the third line there need not be a condition, because the price determination in the table runs from top to bottom; so if the quantity is not less than 20 pieces, the third price is used (empty condition = always true) For better readability, a column \"quantity\" can be defined in the table; then the table looks like this."

        "output": "Print mask: The functionality of this module ranges from the printing of receipts to the creation of serial e-mails and archiving files. Single print vs. serial print: The simplest version of output is the output of a single document. For this purpose, the print window is called up via the editing mask of the document. The name of the print window usually contains the number and the name of the document. It is important for the individual print out that the type of correspondence address (street, e-mail or fax address) does not control the type of output but the user. Depending on which button (Preview, Print, Email, Fax, Save) is used to start printing, the type of output is determined. The serial print can be started in two different ways. On the one hand, the documents to be printed can be selected via a specially provided selection window \"Activities -> Print\", on the other hand, the documents can be transferred to the print module via the respective list window. The window name indicates how many receipts are to be printed. In some cases, the window name also indicates how many receipts are to be output as fax, email or paper. In mail merge, the output is controlled by the correspondence address of the voucher. If an email address was selected here, the document is automatically sent as an email. If you want to have a look at the preview before the correct print, this is normally possible with single print. With mail merge, only the preview of one of the documents to be printed is displayed. If an email is generated in single print, it is not sent automatically, but the generated email is opened in Outlook. The user can once again skim the generated email and then send it as a normal email generated in Outlook itself. In mail merge, however, the emails are sent directly. If you want to check the content of the mails again afterwards, you can do this via the folder 'sent objects' in Outlook. Archiving: The presetting of archiving takes place in the document and is thus also defined/preset depending on the document. Archiving can be switched off (standard) or only registration can take place. In the latter case, the system only remembers when and by which employee a document was printed. If archiving is switched on, you can specify whether a Word or PDF document is to be generated as an archive document and whether this document is to be stored in a directory. The latter is recommended, as otherwise the database can become very large very quickly if no directory is defined and the documents are saved in the ClassiX database. When the print template is called up, the default settings are transferred to the archiving group, but can be changed here. If the resulting document is archived in a directory, the file name is derived from the document name, which is also displayed in the window title of the print mask, whereby all spaces are replaced by underscores. The file \"Bestellung_004534.doc\" is thus created from the order number 004534. If this file already exists because the document has been printed before, the file name is extended by a running index. In all cases, except when archiving is switched off, an output object is created which records the print date and the person responsible for the print. When archiving to a directory, this object also holds the path to the document, otherwise the document is held directly. The output object is displayed in the \"Repeat\" tab of the print mask. From here it can be opened or printed again. Email dispatch via Outlook or SMTP: If a print document is sent by email, the type of sending can be selected in addition to the file format of the attachment - PDF or DOC. There are two options to choose from here. On the one hand the email can be sent via MS Outlook. ClassiX automatically creates and sends an e-mail in Outlook. In mass printing this happens in the background without the user noticing. The e-mail is treated by Outlook like a normal e-mail and can be found in the folder \"Sent Objects\". This allows the user to check, among other things, that the email was sent successfully. In single print mode the generated email is opened and can be sent by the user. Sendingemails via SMTP is a more direct way. The advantage is, on the one hand, that no Outlook installation is required and, on the other, that it brings performance advantages. The latter is especially advantageous for mass printing. As the e-mail is not sent via an Outlook account, either the e-mail address of the user registered in ClassiX or a free address is used. To the user's e-mail address the e-mail is also sent as blindcopy (bcc). This way the e-mail can be archived in Outlook if required and the arrival of the copy is considered as confirmation of successful sending. The prerequisite for using the SMTP service is that the name of the SMTP server has been specified in the \"System\" tab in the client. Sending a fax via Outlook or a fax driver: Faxes can be sent via a mail program - such as Outlook - or via a fax driver. The settings for which of these options can be used are made in the options. With the option\"Output via mail programme The sending of the fax is taken over by the mail program from here on. With the option\"Output via fax driver\", the name of the fax driver must also be specified in the option window. The fax driver is addressed like a printer driver, the fax number must be encrypted in the printout - depending on the printer driver, for example, in the form of a document variable. When printing, the system searches for the fax driver in the list of printers and \"prints\" the generated document using this driver. The fax driver then takes over the transmission of the fax. Default setting of the print document: The presetting of the print document is done in various ways. By default, the presetting of the document is controlled by the number and depends on the document type. For example, the document with the number \"SAO\" - if available - is always automatically selected when a job is to be printed. Interesting for the user is the selection of the standard document via the document presettings. Here, a document can be assigned to each document type, which is preset in the print mask when printing. This setting can be made for a client, a cost centre or even for a user individually. However, differentiation must also be made when determining the standard document via the document presettings. For example, a standard document is usually always determined via the type of objects to be printed. However, it is also possible to differentiate here via conditional document presettings. For example, the document can be set for the order depending on the order type. Important: If different documents are determined by different conditions during mass printing, the standard document determined via the number or the class is preset. Print mask: The document and various properties of the print can be set via the print mask and thus the appearance of the output can be controlled. The type of output (printer, email, fax, file) is also defined here by the user. Print Preview: After selecting a document, the print preview can be called up via the print mask. The created document is displayed in the print preview and can even be edited. However, these should only be cosmetic changes. Changes to the document data should also only be made via the respective editing screen of the document, as otherwise they are not traceable. Since it is also possible to print from the print preview, archiving processes can also be started here. Selection window: You can search for documents to be printed via the selection window. In this way, for example, mass printing (e.g. all orders created today but not yet printed) can be started. Documents not sent/printed: After a print operation, this window displays the documents that are associated with the document to be printed, but which could not be printed/sent automatically. The documents can be displayed via the \"Open\" button, thus initiating manual printing/sending. This window always appears when printing documents with associated documents, as these cannot be printed automatically. When sending by email, the documents are transferred as attachments. An example of documents associated with vouchers is procurement documents. Order reminder: When calculating the open quantity, unit errors are ignored and no open quantity is printed for the item in question. Activity document: In contrast to the output of other documents, the special feature of transaction documents is that it is not absolutely necessary to select a document. The interaction between the type of message text and the document selection is as follows: recommendation/conclusion: The presetting of the document is controlled via the document presettings just like the presetting of the message text. The following combinations are possible. If the message text of the transaction document has a header and/or footer, the presetting of the document by the document presettings does not apply. When creating an email, external documents are attached to the email. Goods receipt: The additional documents selected in the list are output as subsequent pages and should consist of free blocks. Convert MS Word .doc file to .pdf: This window is not used for advanced print output, but for converting Word documents located on the hard disk into PDF documents. Procedure. Bank Clearing Accompanying note: The Bank Clearing Accompanying Note has no class of its own. For the document presettings this means that the general class CX_TRANSACTION must be selected here. Parts Labels: The parts for which labels are to be printed are shown in the first tab \"Division\". Entries can be duplicated with the \"Duplicate\" buttons and removed with \"Remove\". The number of copies can be changed for selected entries using the context menu (right mouse button in the list). Double click on an entry to edit the number of copies, quantity and weight.

        "output": "Printing with OLE (document printing). Description: This help gives you an overview of the printing options. Document modules: The document modules are the enveloping objects for the OLE objects. It has a multilingual name, number, type, OLE text and sub-modules. The type of a document block determines the order in which it is printed (see Order in which document blocks are printed). A document module can have the following type: Document header, List header, List position, List footer, List transfer below, List transfer above, List group, Document footer (last page), footers If a document module has submodules, these are taken into account when printing. The system behaves as if the module itself were a document, i.e. all submodules are printed in the same sequence as in the document (see Sequence when printing document modules). Document: A document (pseudo-class CX_DOCUMENT) consists of document modules and has further characteristics such as margin settings, document type, name and document number. Possible document types are: purchasing, Sale, manufacturing, stock, Financial accounting, controlling, Miscellaneous When printing a document, the type of document module determines the order. Sequence when printing document blocks: If the printout fits on one page: Multi-page printout: 1st page 2nd last page Last page. OLE objects in the document module: The OLE objects contain document variables that are replaced on printing with the values of the object to be printed. To do this, the print object must be placed in the PlugSpace (see the statement Define (SetTransactionPlugSpace) in the printole.mod module). By default, the client object and a temporary print object are also placed in the PlugSpace (the client object contains all important information about the client, such as the address; the temporary print object is currently only required for the output of page numbers and subtotals). If the object to be printed is a transaction, all subtransactions are printed as list items of the object. Functions: In ClassiX®, document output is controlled by a document object, which also serves as a buffer between the InstantView® instructions and the print output channel of the respective operating system. The document object holds the information of the entire document and the output is explicitly triggered with PrintDocument. A preview on the screen is also possible. Printing instructions: The system has four classes as follows: CX_PRINTER, CX_PRINTER_PROPERTIES, CX_PAGE_PROPERTIES, CX_PAPER_FORMAT, which can store the settings of the printer and various document types. The objects of these classes can be made persistent. A list of printers installed on the client can be obtained from Printermanager using the function GetInstalledPrinters. To set or display the printer properties the class CX_PRINTER has the function SelectPrinterProperties. This function displays the printer-installed dialog of selected printers, which depends on the printer. Because in this dialog both printer properties (printer name, printer port,.) and page properties (paper size, paper orientation,.) can be set, the function SelectPrinterProperties puts two objects back on the stack: CX_PRINTER_PROPERTIES and CX_PAGE_PROPERTIES. The margin settings usually cannot be set in the Printer Properties dialog and must be set from within InstantView®, the same applies to custom paper sizes. All paper formats are the objects of the class CX_PAPER_FORMAT. The setting of printer, printer and page properties for a document is done by calling a member function SetPagePropertiesAndPrinter, which saves the settings for a page area. Once the settings have been made, the document can be checked with the method CheckPrintRange to see whether valid settings have been set for all pages. The CXP_PRINT_JOB class represents a print job in the system. In the CXP_PRINT_JOB object, settings such as print area pages from. to., number of copies, and sorting when printing multiple copies are set in the CXP_PRINT_JOB object. Therefore, a CXP_PRINT_JOB object must be created before the document preparation using the document method CreatePrinterJob. If the document has several page settings, further print jobs are created automatically: one print job per page setting. If spooling is switched off, the print job is started after the document has been completely prepared using the StartPrinting method or the InstantView® statement PrintDocument. When spooling is turned on, the print job is automatically started when the number of completed pages reaches the number of spool pages. With the PrintToFile function, the document can be archived in this machine. During archiving, one or more files of the type Enhanced- Metafile (*.emf) are generated, which can be viewed with the ClassiX®- Metafileviewer. If the document has several page settings, one Metafile is created per page setting and a vector of created file names (transferred file name + page number from the start area of the page setting) and NULL strings is returned. The NULL strings represent the pages with unchanged settings saved in a metafile. Modules: print.mod, printole.mod, printstd.mod, printpro.mod, paper.mod. Object types used: CX_COM_OBJECT, CX_COMPOUND_TXN, CX_CONTAINER, CX_DOCUMENT, CX_MULTIPLE_COM_OBJECT. Dynamic data fields: none."

        "output": "Printing troubleshooting. Blocks are not displayed contiguously: One of the possibilities for an incorrect display of document blocks is a \"hard line break\" in a dynamic data field. These can be found quickly in the Word Editor in the formatting view (¶). The line break should either be removed completely or replaced by a soft line break ( Shift + Return ). Formatting of the DocVariable is not reproduced correctly.: Microsoft Word sometimes plays mean tricks on users and developers. During the development phase of ClassiX® the phenomenon occurred that a DocVariable in an OLE module is assigned a certain format (e.g. Arial, bold, italics) and then later on is not displayed correctly when printed. In this case it helps unfortunately only the whole block (or table column) in which the variable is to be reformatted. The best way is to mark the block and set it to normal format ( Shift + Ctrl + N ). Afterwards the formatting can be set again. Document variable is not recognized.: Word reports that the document variable is not available when editing the OLE module: In the simplest case, this could be due to a typing error in the document variable. To check the spelling of the variable, switch to the field function mode (Alt + F9). If the variable is written correctly, it could still be an update problem. Exit the Word Editor and call it up again. Finding required DocVariables: The required DocVariables can be identified via the monitor window. To do this, move the mouse pointer over the element to be included (e.g. the customer's address in the offer mask) and press the right mouse button. The monitor window opens and the title bar already contains the name of the desired object (in this case: \"address\"). With the InstantView® command \" GetObject \"you get the desired object on the stack and with the call: \" SendMsg(INSPECT_OBJECT) \"the object can be viewed in the object inspector. In the object inspector you can now view the attributes of the selected object. For example, if we want to insert the customer's company headquarters as DocVariable in a document module, we note this in the DocVariable as follows: (cf. insertion of \"dynamic data fields\"). Standard DocVariables: In order to make processing in document creation a little easier, some of the most important DocVariables for document creation are listed here. \"var \": The InstantView® variables can be accessed via the function:\"var()\". (Example var(cyberEnterprise).uniqueID=\"000\" determines the current client) See also:\"Access expression (\"var\") In order to locate the InstantView® variables in the monitor window, the object \"cyberEnterprise\" can be placed on the stack. From here the variables can be accessed with the function\"Get()\" or\"Copy()\". Or via: \" SendMsg(INSPECT_OBJECT) \"the object can be viewed in the object inspector. Similarly, you can also call up the monitor window from the print dialogue and select printObject place the entire document on the stack. This can now again be checked with the object inspector ( SendMsg(INSPECT_OBJECT) ) and search for variable names. \"call \": With the help of the special function call(macro name ) InstantView® macros, which provide a return value, can also be accessed to use them as DocVariable. If the macro returns an object as return value, the access expressions can also be used in the conventional way. For example call(Makroname).y List of frequently used InstantView® variables. IF condition is not interpreted correctly: In almost all conditions it is checked whether a value is present or not. The condition then looks like the following: { IF { DOCVARIABLE uniqueID } <> \" \" \"Instruction for true\" \"Instruction for false\" } This example checks whether the data field uniqueID unequal (<>) is empty. Please note that empty in Word is represented by two double inverted commas with a space between them. ( \" \" not \"\" ) If the condition is still not recognised, the document variable against which the comparison is to be made must also be placed in double inverted commas. Result: { IF \"{ DOCVARIABLE uniqueID }\" <> \" \" \"Instruction for true\" \"Instruction for false\" }. A document module is not printed: A document module (e.g. the header) was not printed."

These can be capacitive resources such as work areas, work groups, workstations, machines or even material resources such as parts. In addition to the direct assignment (scheduling) of a document (quotation, internal or external order) to a project network, a network can also generally only be linked to a higher-level cost object or a cost centre. In the latter case, for example, if you want to schedule cost centre-related basic loads. The scheduling can be done in the form of interlinked and nested milestones, whereby each individual milestone can be scheduled with regard to different dates. To speed up scheduling, pre-defined resource plans can be used, in which any resources in any quantity can be saved as patterns for frequently recurring scheduling tasks. Such project networks can be assigned either to quotations, orders, internal orders or cost objects (sales projects). Input window project network: This window is used to maintain a project network.

All movement data of parts and their storage locations are evaluated and added together, average prices, start, dispatch, receipt and end values are determined. Finally, the value of the warehouse can be read off from these end values for each desired period. However, a few things have to be taken into account for an error-free determination of the bearing value: These plausibility checks are part of the functionality of the warehouse statistics. If parts or warehouses have been selected in the selection mask and the corresponding time period has been set, it is possible to start specific automatic test runs. The results of such test runs - more or less relevant for an evaluation - are displayed in the results window integrated in the warehouse statistics. This results window directly offers the possibility to correct some of the displayed errors and to redetermine the evaluation. If the displayed errors for a part/storage bin have not been completely corrected, the month-end closing for this part/storage bin is not completely possible, which is indicated by a \"red dot\" in the respective line of the stock statistics. Errors such as movements without price/value are generally caused by missing information in the parts master: if, for example, an order part lacks the order roll or no standard price is entered on the order roll, a goods withdrawal cannot be valuated, but the system does allow it - to avoid malfunctions. In order to find such parts, the inspection module of the materials management system includes corresponding test runs. Further inspection runs are: IMPORTANT!

In the options window, set the Lowest value inventory evaluation type and close the window with OK. 9.1 Error log: Now the error log is compiled via the menu item \"Closing->Lowest value inventory->Error log\". Data records are listed for which no lowest value can be determined. If there are parts with stock in this log, an inventory valuation price must be determined. They are valued at the lower of cost or market. This is formed by comparing the standard transfer price valid on 31 December of the valuation period with the last purchase price of the A-supplier within the valuation period. The standard transfer price is calculated as follows: Gross price minus discount and bonus. Furthermore, percentage price change expectations (annual average) are announced by the purchasing department and processed in the standard transfer price. Discounts are taken into account as a lump sum in the overall valuation. If the standard transfer price is zero, the last purchase price is used. If this is also at zero, the last physical inventory valuation price is used. 9.2 Set lowest value inventory: The lowest value can now be set. For this purpose, the menu item \"Closings->Lowest value inventory->Set\" must be activated. The list now shows the inventory price, - value and - net value The warehouse statistics with the valuation at the lowest value can now be called up again at any time. 9.3 Remove lowest value inventory: The lowest value can be deleted/removed again.

        "output": "Invoice - account assignment and initial account assignment. Preliminary account assignment in general: In order to transfer costs and revenues to the financial accounting, ClassiX® provides a preliminary account assignment of various documents, such as incoming and outgoing invoices. During the initial account assignment the costs incurred (incoming invoices) and revenues (outgoing invoices) are assigned to different evaluation objects. In addition to the cost element (or the G/L account), these are the cost centres and the cost object. The initial account assignment is carried out automatically when the documents are posted. The rules for this are described on this page. During the initial account assignment, so-called posting containers are created. In addition to the value to be posted, the account (cost element or G/L account) to which the value is to be posted in financial accounting is specified here. The setting, whether account assignment is to be made via a cost element or a G/L account, is specified via the option \"Cost element accounting\" in the client. If no account can be determined during the initial account assignment, no posting container is created. Cost centre and cost unit accounting is also activated above the client. In these cases, the posting container can also contain the cost centre and/or cost object to be debited or credited. The cost element defines whether a cost object or cost centre is allowed or mandatory for a cost element. After the initial account assignment, the created posting containers are checked for these specifications. In the detailed initial account assignment, which can also be activated via the client, each invoice item is individually preassigned. This means that cost element, cost centre and cost object are determined individually for each item. The summation of the posting containers takes place in the document header, however, as only this is posted in the financial accounting. The sum of the values of the booking containers must always equal the gross value of the invoice. If this is not the case, for example because an account could not be determined and therefore no posting container could be created, the invoice is considered as not assigned to an account. In this case, it is possible to carry out the initial account assignment manually via the incoming invoice book or the outgoing invoice book. Even in the case of automatically preassigned invoices, the account assignment can be checked once again before posting the documents in the financial accounting system and, if necessary, changed manually. This task is also carried out by the incoming or outgoing invoice book. Another example for the account assignment in ClassiX® is the cash book, in which the vouchers are directly assigned and posted. Determining the account: For both incoming and outgoing invoices, the account of the posting containers is determined via statistics groups. In sales these are the sales statistics groups, which are assigned to the article groups of the sales roles. In purchasing these are the purchasing statistics groups which are assigned to the parts classifications of the parts. (Since a part can only have one order article role at a time, the purchasing statistics groups are thus also directly assigned to the order articles). Through the direct assignment of the order articles or sales roles to the mentioned statistics groups, which conditionally specify the account directly or via a table, both an article group-oriented and a partner-oriented account assignment can be made. Article group-oriented account assignment: With the article group-oriented initial account assignment, in the structure \"article group\" (sales) or \"parts classification\" (purchasing), each account is assigned its own statistics group and thus usually a fixed or conditional account. This is done via the purchasing or sales statistics groups. If an A/R or A/P invoice item is assigned to an account, the account is determined via the item's article and the item is assigned to an account. Sales: Outgoing invoice item -> sales article role -> article group -> sales statistics group -> account Purchasing: Incoming invoice item -> part -> parts classification -> purchasing statistics group -> account Text articles have no article group assignment by default and are therefore not automatically assigned to an account. There are two ways to change this. On the one hand, the statistics group which is then used to determine the account can be specified in the order/invoice item. On the other hand, the account - if necessary also a conditional account - can be directly assigned to the classification term \"sales statistics groups\". The prerequisite for this is that no sales article is directly assigned to the classification term \"statistics groups\", but only to a subnode. Partner-oriented account assignment: With partner-oriented account assignment, the account is determined independently of the articles. In this case, only one (purchasing/sales) statistics group is linked to the top structure node of the article group or parts classification. The account is determined conditionally using this statistics group. As a rule, partner data, such as the tax type (German tax, EU taxation, foreign tax) or document data, such as the tax key, is queried in the conditions. A sales statistics group is assigned to the structure node of the item group (or a higher-level node) as a structured object. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"103\"}: In the sales statistics group, the assignment to the structure node can be maintained. You can also edit the conditional account. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"105\"} The conditional account is used to determine the cost element or the G/L account depending on the condition. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"104\"}. Account assignment of incoming invoices: The account assignment of incoming invoices differs from the account assignment of outgoing invoices in that, as an alternative to the account assignment via the statistics groups, the cost element or the G/L account can also be specified directly in the item. If no partner-oriented account assignment is carried out or the article group-oriented account assignment is not defined via the groups, the cost element or G/L account can even be specified in the order article, which is then transferred to the incoming invoice item. Determination of cost units and cost centres: The determination of cost centres and cost objects is identical in principle for outgoing and incoming invoices, but differs in one detail. In both cases, the cost centres and cost objects are defined by their predecessors and transferred to the invoice items. The difference between the outgoing and incoming invoices is that in the case of the outgoing invoices, the items can only be assigned to one cost object and cost centre, as these always have only one predecessor. Overall, an invoice can also apply to several cost objects and cost centres, but not at item level. An incoming invoice item, on the other hand, can also debit several cost objects, if, for example, parts of different orders were procured via one order item. The same applies to the cost centre. In this case, the costs are distributed to the various cost centres and cost objects during initial account assignment. Determination of the cost units/cost centres to be debited (\"normal\" incoming invoice items): When distributing the costs of an incoming invoice item to several cost objects and cost centres, it is assumed that all predecessors have the same part and therefore the share of the predecessors in the costs can be determined based on the quantity. If, during the allocation of costs, it is determined that only one cost unit and/or one cost centre is charged, this is displayed in the editing window of the incoming invoice items and can also be changed here. The initial account assignment is then always made to the cost object and cost centre displayed in the mask. If it was determined when creating the incoming invoice item that different cost objects and cost centres must be debited, these are saved internally together with the share (in percent) of the costs of the item. In the editing window of the incoming invoice item, one of the cost units and cost centres is then randomly displayed. If the user now selects a new cost centre or a different cost object via the item mask, the following question is asked when saving {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"107\"} If he confirms this question with \"yes\", the internal allocation of costs to the various cost centres and cost objects is deleted and only the selected evaluation objects are debited. If the costs are still to be distributed to different cost centres/cost objects afterwards, the invoice must be manually assigned to an account in the invoice receipt book. Determination of the cost units/cost centres to be debited for free incoming invoice items: In the case of free items, the costs are divided similarly, but as these have different order items with different parts as predecessors, a division according to quantity makes no sense. Therefore the value of the delivery schedule line is taken into account in the allocation. If one or more order headers are selected as predecessors, all delivery schedule lines are taken into account in the cost allocation."

        "output": "Preliminary requirements - description: Advance requirements are used to cover real requirements that are generated at a later date. This is useful for parts with long replenishment lead times (planned delivery time or in-house production time). For this reason, preliminary requirements make no sense for e.g. level 0 parts within a sales order. You can create the corresponding order item directly and do not have to take the diversion via advance requirements. Therefore, preliminary requirements should only be created for MRP sub-items of a production BOM that has not yet been exploded and technically released as a whole, if the time between technical release and the required procurement date is shorter than the expected delivery time. However, the same can also apply to sub-items kept in stock, which have a very low minimum stock level, show high consumption and also have a relatively long delivery time. There you can use the advance requirements to reserve a certain number of parts in the warehouse before the actual disposition of the finally exploded parts list. The system only makes sense if the planned part is actually scheduled at a later point in time, i.e. can be offset. It therefore makes no sense to create an advance requirement for part X, whereby this part always occurs as a component of the higher-level and stock-keeping part Z, and this part Z is also ultimately planned. It makes just as little sense to create an advance requirement for a part that only appears in parts lists as a constructive (fictitious) item and is ultimately never manufactured and is therefore not planned. Advance requirements documents can be created in the course of planning. When creating a preliminary requirement, it is specified for which order and on which date how much goods are expected to be needed. A preliminary requirements document can contain several items. Only one - not completed, openly running - preliminary requirement can be triggered per order for each part. A scheduled advance requirement item (with a staging date) is posted in the MRP account as a requirement trigger (\"future issue\") and therefore leads to an increase in requirements for the corresponding part. The \"aim\" of the document is to reserve or procure the preplanned quantity in advance. Later, the respective advance requirement item is replaced by a \"real\" requirement trigger in the MRP account; this can be an order item or a part requirement item. Registration in the dispo account: Advance requirements always post two quantities in the MRP account: 1. sales order quantity (quantity of the advance requirement item not yet staged) 2. reserved quantity (quantity of the advance requirement item not yet allocated to an order item) More about the bookings here. The advance requirement remains in the MRP account until it has neither an open, unallocated quantity nor an open, uncommitted quantity left. For example, an advance requirement may appear in the MRP account with open quantity 0. This then only counts up the reserved quantity. How the demand is met depends on whether the part is a purchased part or a production part. Purchase part:: When saving a scheduled (i.e. a provision date has been entered) advance requirement item with an MRP purchased part, a requirement request is automatically generated which then participates in a normal procurement cycle(approval, order, etc.). The requirement generated by the advance requirement is thus immediately covered again by a requirement request or purchase order in the MRP account. When the goods receipt arrives, it can be immediately prepared for this order. Even if the advance requirement has not yet been assigned to an order item. The demand for stocked purchased parts is normally reported via the demand and stock list, which can also be used to start the supply chain. Production part:: As soon as scheduling is complete (i.e. a provision date has been entered), the production cycle can be started for the advance requirement item with a production part: by pressing the button \"Explode parts lists\" (in the toolbar on the advance requirement item screen) the explosion of the parts list defined for the part is started. The requirement is covered by the corresponding production order item. The quantity reserved by an advance requirement item can be used up in two cases: 1. a part is pre-planned for an order -> in the order an order item with the same part is created => the order item is automatically linked to the advance requirement item (document history ) and the quantity is transferred If the full reserved quantity has been consumed (order item quantity greater than or equal to the quantity reserved via advance requirements), the advance requirement is thus automatically completed; otherwise, only the order item quantity is rebooked. 2. a part is preplanned for an order -> for an order item in the order a part request for production is created (e.g. a gozintograph), in which the preplanned part is needed => the corresponding part request item is automatically linked to the advance requirement item (document history), disposition type is set to \"advance\" type and the quantity is transferred. If the full reserved quantity has been consumed (part requirement item quantity greater than or equal to the quantity reserved via advance requirements), the advance requirement is thus automatically completed; otherwise, only the part requirement item quantity is transferred. Cancellation of advance requirement items: The \"Remove\" button above the list in the pre-requirement editing window can be used to remove pre-requirement items. If this advance requirement has not yet been further processed, it can simply be deleted. However, if a requirement request has already been made or a bill of material exploded, or if this preliminary requirement has already been linked to a requirement trigger, the system must take various special features into account when deleting. All possibilities are displayed here in the list and explained what happens to their successors:. Bookings of preliminary requirements: The Gozint item that was created directly from the advance requirement (not linked) is never posted to the MRP account. (Maximum.level=0 or has predecessor requirement and at the same time no captured.quantity) The linked Gozintoposition is only posted with the amount.Amount() - captured.quantity. Overhangs: If there is a warehouse stock for an MRP part of the preliminary requirement item, a partial warehouse reservation is created via a warehouse reservation document if the option \"Consume surplus quantities automatically\" is set. If the complete advance requirement quantity is available, the complete quantity is also reserved by the warehouse. In case of partial quantities, the reserved quantity is reduced by the following document (part request or requirement request)."

        "output": "Attributes - Processes: 2.1 Preset attribute A preset attribute allows a dynamic data field to be given a descriptive name, further explanatory data or a default setting. Example: A carpet seller with a ClassiX® software wants to describe his carpets by different characteristics. For example, all carpets should be described by their price. So he adds a characteristic to all master data, in which he can then specify the price. If individual carpets are to be described by their colour (no free input, only colours from a colour table should be available), he can do this by means of an attribute, which for example describes a data field of type 'String'. This attribute is then provided with a table with the different colours. Attention: Attribute values are only supported in the formulas up to a maximum of 100 characters! 2.2 Formula attributes As the name suggests, formula attributes are used to fill a data field with a formula, or with the value that the formula calculates. Constants can be entered directly into the formula while the variable values are slot attributes. Example: The carpet seller now wants to describe his carpets also by size, whereby the carpets have the characteristic that all carpets have the same width (4m) and differ only in length. Here the carpet seller benefits from the formula attributes. So he creates an attribute with the formula '4m * length'. The length is again a preset attribute, whereby the value or the result of the formula attribute changes automatically when the value is changed. 2.3 Conditional attributes Conditional attributes can contain a table that describes an \"if - then\" relationship. Example: The carpets of the carpet seller are to have their own price per colour. We now create a conditional attribute and fill the table with the data we need for the price calculation. (e.g.: red -> 10 € ; blue -> 20 € ; yellow -> 30€ ) In addition, we set our just created attribute in dependence of the attribute for the colour.(see example Preset attribute) If the attribute for the colour is changed, the corresponding value of the condition table is now automatically returned. 1. why attributes?: Attributes are of central importance in ClassiX®, as they allow to describe an object (object, person object or similar) in all its characteristics without having to make changes to the source code. Example: The aim is to describe a sales item by its colour. 6. gradual and conditional expression of attributes: Attribute nodes allow the gradual and conditional expression of attributes. This is particularly useful in product configuration (the specification of variant parts), but can also be useful when entering any form (document) or master data. Application example for the gradual development: An application example for the gradual development of attributes is the division of a complex table of values of an attribute. Let us assume there is an attribute \"MATERIAL\". Behind this attribute there is a very large selection of different materials (various types of steel, aluminium and plastic as well as numerous alloys). This table can become very long, so it could take longer to select the right material. As a solution to this problem, the attribute \"MATERIAL\" can be created several times and the result table can be restricted in each case. So mine could create an attribute for steel, aluminium etc. and offer only the corresponding selection options as a result table. In addition you would have to create a new attribute \"MATERIAL_ART\" with the selection table: steel, aluminium, plastic and alloys. Behind this attribute, an attribute node is stored, which refers to the corresponding attribute \"MATERIAL\" depending on the set value. For example, in the sales item the attribute \"MATERIAL_ART\" is then inserted instead of the complex table \"MATERIAL\". In the order, you then first select \"MATERIAL_ART\". The corresponding attribute \"MATERIAL\" is then automatically added and in the second step this value can then be set. Application example for the conditional gradual characteristic: The conditional characteristic behaves similarly to the application example mentioned above, but is a little more complex. In the first example, the expression of one attribute led to other attributes with the same name with filtered result tables. However, an extensive product configuration can also be carried out via the attribute nodes. Let us imagine the configuration of a car. A car can be defined by many parameters. However, these parameters can be strongly interdependent. For example, after selecting 2- or 4-door, the question of rear electric windows may be obsolete. The same applies if one of the parameters is selected as the series and various extras are then already included. This type of multi-level conditional configuration is also possible via the attribute nodes. 7. editing of attributes in master and transaction data: The group for editing attributes on master data and transaction data is usually as follows. {img fileId=\"248\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Global attributes are represented by the globe, local attributes are marked with the box. The values can be maintained by double-clicking on one of the attributes. Behind the purple lines there are visible attributes which have been inserted in a structured way. This means that various attributes have been combined into an attribute node (see Structuring of Attributes). By double-clicking on the purple line, the node is expanded and the attributes of this node are displayed. Another double-click collapses the node again. The button \"Edit\" leads to a selected . . global attribute to edit the attribute value in the list. . local attribute for editing the attribute in the edit mask . purple attribute node for editing the node designation in the list The list of attributes can be extended by clicking the \"Insert\" button. The normal case is that a root attribute is selected and inserted. Here there are the options \"At end\", \"Before selected position\" and \"Behind selected position\". In addition, a local attribute can also be created. Here the type of the attribute (\"Presettable\", \"Calculated\", \"Conditional\") must be determined via the menu. Via the menu \"Insert new structural level\" an attribute node can be created manually. Attributes can then be moved up and down in this node using the arrows. The arrow keys take over the function to determine the order of the attributes. You can also move an attribute into an attribute node or retrieve it again. Before attributes are moved to a level from within it, the user is asked if he really wants to perform this action. 8. use of comparison operators: Even before creating a new attribute with an attached table, it is important to know how to work with it later. You must also be aware that the attributes can have different types internally, e.g. STRING, ENUMCHAR, etc. In the case of characteristics created as type STRING or with a data field of type STRING, the value (text) entered by the user is retained internally and is therefore also used for comparisons. If, however, you create a characteristic with the type ENUMCHAR, for example, the internal structure of the attached table is different. There is no longer the value directly (e.g. text in the case of the type STRING), but in the internal table there is a numbering given by the feeder and for each of the entries the value to be shown externally, e.g. 1 -> apples, 2 -> pears and 3 -> bananas. For comparison operations, the internal value is always used in all cases of e.g. ENUMCHAR, because you cannot compare apples with pears over \"bigger\" or \"smaller\", so to speak. But of course you can test for \"equal\" without any problems, but you have to be very careful with \"not equal\" comparisons. This is especially true in cases where one has created, for example, the following table: 1 -> \"100\", 2 -> \"200\" and 3 -> \"150\". There you cannot simply make the comparison \"less than or equal to 200\", because the \"200\" is first converted into the internal value 2, and with the internal values only 1 and 2 are \"less than or equal to 2\", so that the entry 3 -> \"150\" is not output."

Description: Many manufacturing processes require work to complete a part or an assembly that your own company cannot provide (e.g. special surface finishing such as galvanising). For this purpose, ClassiX® offers the possibility to integrate external work sequences into work plans. It is also possible that the work is to be carried out completely by an external company. The external manufacturer needs all the material of the production stage, whether pre-assembled or not, to carry out the work. For all these cases the external work sequences are suitable. If only a part of the parts list is to be sent to the external manufacturer because he procures or owns the rest of the required parts himself, it is more advisable to declare the part not as a production part with external work sequence, but as a purchased part with self-supply. Description of provided parts. Each workstation can contain resources in the form of machines, work groups or suppliers. These resources assigned to the work centre in this way can be used freely on the routing as soon as the work centre has been selected on the routing item.

        "output": "Business processes - Purchasing. General overview of the shopping area: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"195\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} The purchasing area is characterised not only by the procurement itself, but also by preceding and subsequent processes. Thus, a demand fulfilment is usually based on a demand that may have arisen through the most diverse types. These include the customer requirement (order item, production parts list, gozo item), as well as the requirement of a cost centre. Through the B&B list, requirements of stock parts (quantity shortfall) and/or of dispositive purchase parts (deadline control) can be uncovered. Other requirements can of course also be recorded. The next step is the requirement request, the precursor of the order. Rules can be established here under which the requirement coverage requests must pass through an approval cycle. Now the actual purchasing department comes into play, which creates the order according to the request data (part, quantity, delivery date) and the information from the order role of the part and the supplier agreements (delivery time, price, conditions, .). If information is not sufficiently available, the buyer can also make a request to the supplier. He is supported by the possibility of comparing prices. If a framework order exists with the supplier, the buyer can also use the release order. The documents following in the document history only affect the purchase order in so far as they have an influence on the status of the order. For example, a purchase order is only reported as complete when goods receipt or direct delivery documents have been created for the entire order quantity. The incoming invoice therefore has a corresponding influence on the billing status of the purchase order. Order of services: Ordered services are reported ready by checking the box \"No (further) goods receipt expected\" in the group \"Process control\" on the delivery schedule of the follow-up order, as there should be no goods receipt for this. Exceptions are orders for services in the case of external work sequences, i.e. if provisions are sent to the supplier with which, for example, the surface treatment is stated on the order as a unit of performance. Here it is perfectly legitimate to generate a goods receipt and even a QA for the unit of performance, since the performance can also be checked directly. If, for example, 3 out of 10 parts to be galvanised are not completely galvanised, a return document can be generated and thus a subsequent claim for this service. Approval procedure: By means of the settings in the client and in the cost centres (organisation chart), the approval procedure of the requirement requests (BA), the purchase orders and/or the incoming invoices can be activated and a control system can be set up. In addition to the control system, it is also possible (depending on the settings) to define an approver manually. General definitions and rules Authorisation procedure for requisitions The approval procedure begins to take effect already during the creation of the requisition by the automatic/manual setting of the approver, but it actively influences the purchasing process but only after the requisition has been posted. If an approver was determined/set at the time of posting, the BA is not automatically released and no purchase order can be generated for the items. The BA is now checked manually. On the one hand, the approver can see via his processes which BAs he has to check, on the other hand, the purchasing department can check via the BA status list which BAs still have to be checked to make sure that no BAs are left hanging. From both lists, the module for releasing/rejecting the BA(see here) can be called. If the BA has been approved, the purchasing department can now generate the order(s) using the tools at its disposal. However, to ensure that rejected requisitions are not lost, as the need is likely to still exist, the process is not yet complete here. In the case of rejection, the requirement coverage request is returned to the processor and is available for postprocessing or post-maintenance. The requirement coverage request must then be posted again (activated) and appears for resubmission to the approver. Acceptance of the rejection should be indicated by the cancellation of the requirement coverage request by its processor. Approval procedure for orders The approval procedure for orders is similar to that for requisitions. Thus, the rules defined in the client and in the cost centres are also applied here. The only difference is that order items that have already been preceded by a requirement request no longer need to be approved. Unapproved orders cannot be printed or otherwise output. Using the list window of the orders, the purchasing department can check whether orders in the status \"to be approved\" get stuck and follow up with the approver. Since non-approved orders cannot be printed and are therefore not automatically printed directly, mass printing takes into account the newly approved but not yet printed orders. Approval procedure for incoming invoices The approval procedure for incoming invoices is also similar to that for requisitions and orders. Thus, the rules defined in the client and in the cost centres are also applied here. The following special features are applied in the approval procedure for incoming invoices: An incoming invoice is not released if it has not been approved. In addition, an A/P invoice is not presented to the approver until it has been verified. Approval and verification are two different processes, which are usually also carried out by different employees. During the check, the correctness of the incoming invoice is checked by the person in charge (buyer, requester, etc.). The incoming invoice is then approved by the cost centre manager. Signature regulations: By means of the settings in the client, the signature control for orders can be activated and a control system can be set up. This makes it possible to use the four-eye principle for checking orders in the system! Only when both signatures have been digitally confirmed is the order approved. Subsequent changes can only be made within a defined framework without the consent of the signatory. General definitions and rules.

Incoming goods items in quality assurance have the status \"goods to be inspected\".

Recording: {img fileId=\"259\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}{img fileId=\"261\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} The service call can be used to record both services to be performed(external trigger) and installation and commissioning(internal trigger). The externally triggered service call is primarily used to record the service request, the error message or the problem of the operator (customer). In addition, the assignment to the operator and the industrial plant is set. In the case of internally triggered service calls, the service to be provided is defined by the order processing department (new plants, conversions) to the service department. The assignment to the plant and the customer is made by the predecessor of the order. In addition, the value for internal cost allocation is defined via the service call. Scheduling: {img fileId=\"261\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}{img fileId=\"265\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} From the service call, the service can now create service call items for scheduling service calls. To do this, the service to be performed is described for each item, an employee is determined who is to perform the work and the planned date is defined with a planned working time. ClassiX® supports the service by an automatic capacity planning, which can be carried out via the service call. Every service employee receives his assignments and tasks via the service call. Implementation: {img fileId=\"263\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Each service call position has its own number and is also valid for the service technician as a work certificate/service provider group, via which the service technician then reports back on the services he has performed (travel, installation, maintenance) and the spare parts he has used. Settlement: {img fileId=\"253\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} In the case of internally triggered service calls, the costs are now allocated internally between the triggered and executed cost centre via a cost service posting. {img fileId=\"255\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}{img fileId=\"257\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} For externally triggered service calls, it is now defined whether the service call can be invoiced to the customer or not. In the case of invoicing, the work certificate is transferred to an invoice. If the costs are borne by the customer (warranty), the work certificate is cancelled and automatically converted into an assembly certificate. This is then posted in the financial accounting. General overview: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"251\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}. Spare parts enquiries: In addition to the service requests (service calls), spare parts requests(enquiries) are the second pillar for the inclusion of service requests. This document is used to document customer enquiries and is the starting point for further processing. Enquiries, if they were triggered externally, can refer to an industrial plant, a cost object or a sales order. Enquiries can be nested as deeply as desired, i.e. they can be grouped into topics or enquiry nodes, which are themselves assigned to higher-level topics or enquiry nodes. This is particularly useful when different partners (employees of the same company or third parties working on the same plant) request an enquiry on the same case. Enquiries can be used to identify this so that no different offers are made for the same incident. Enquiries are subject to a workflow that enables them to be processed by different commercial and technical team members. For example, it is conceivable that the technical processing department researches and specifies the required spare parts, while the commercial processing department is responsible for the further preparation of offers and order processing. The spare parts can be assigned directly to the enquiry, so that quotations and orders can be generated automatically. An advantage of the enquiry is that each enquiry gets a unique number (ticket number), which channels the communication with the customer and supplier (regarding technical queries). In addition, pre-fabricated emails (confirmation of receipt, queries, etc.) can be generated using stored forms. Business transactions are documented via the document history. Incoming emails can be linked to the request as document references, giving every employee access to the communication objects involved. Maintenance invoices: Maintenance invoices are used for the automatic, periodic invoicing of maintenance flat rates, without the need to provide a service in addition to the \"provision\" of the maintenance in the agreed period. Maintenance flat rates are defined via an order or an order item which contains the condition category \"Recurring payment\". Maintenance invoices are automatically generated via the module \"Accounting of due recurring payments\". Maintenance contracts: Maintenance contracts are used to automatically create periodic service and maintenance orders. Here, too, the condition \"Recurring payment\" serves to define the interval at which maintenance is to be carried out cyclically. The \"Due Maintenance Contracts\" module is used to determine the service and maintenance contracts due and to generate the service/maintenance orders from these. The service/maintenance contract ideally defines the agreed services via service provider groups. These enable the service technicians to be scheduled directly. However, maintenance contracts do not have to be invoiced. Breach of contract: Problems in the contractual relationship can be recorded and documented in the event of contractual faults. In the event of possible legal action, the disruptions can thus be fully traced. Spare parts list: Spare parts lists enable the listing and output of all spare parts numbers for a project. In the case of variant parts, specification numbers can also be assigned to the characteristics in order to facilitate ordering by the customer."

        "output": "Business processes - Sales - Billing. Definition: Invoicing (from Latin-Spanish factura for invoice) is a process in accounting where an invoice is issued to a customer for goods and/or services that have been delivered and/or provided (in rare cases, foreseen). Invoicing also involves posting the business case to appropriate accounts. Process: The invoicing process begins with the entry of the order. When creating the order items, a rule is used to determine which items are given the billing status. Only items that have this status can be billed. So if a sales set has the billing status but not the lower parts, only the sales set can be included in an invoice. A single sub-item can therefore neither be invoiced nor credited. There are two ways to create the invoice. Firstly, the quick delivery/invoicing module can be called up from the order. Various options can be used here to control how an invoice is to be created. However, it is always the case that all order items that have not yet been invoiced are included in the invoice. Another way is to create the invoice manually. This way, individual order items can be transferred to the invoice via the invoice module. Invoice items always have an order item as predecessor. It is also possible to generate an invoice from a delivery note (e.g. via the quick invoicing module). This is useful, for example, if partial deliveries are to be invoiced individually. In this case the invoice item has the delivery note item as predecessor and this in turn has the order item. The registration is the end of the registration of the invoice. At this point, the invoice is pre-assigned and frozen. If the invoice cannot be assigned to an account, either the account assignment rules must be adjusted or manual account assignment must be carried out. Invoices which have the status \"registered\" can be transferred to the financial accounting via the outgoing invoice book. The commercial part of the invoicing process is now complete, unless the invoiced goods need to be credited. Status: The order items and the order header also have a billing status, which is determined via the invoiced quantity. Therefore, if an order item of three pieces has an invoice item of also three pieces of at least one registered invoice as successor, the order item is also considered to be invoiced. If this is not the case, it assumes the status \"not billed\" or \"partially billed\". An order is considered as invoiced when all its items, which have the billing status, have been invoiced. However, there are exceptions to this, as there are three types of invoices. Up to now, the type \"Itemised (normal)\" has always been assumed, which causes the behaviour mentioned. In contrast, invoices of the type \"Itemised (flat rate)\" have no effect on the order status. This type is used, for example, if additional costs are to be invoiced for an item, but the normal invoicing of the item still follows. The same applies to credit memos if the credit memo for an item should not result in the order item having to be re-invoiced. A third type is the invoice type \"order-related\". Here no order item is shown in the invoice but only the order header itself. This case is used for additional costs which cannot be assigned to an item or also for flat-rate credit notes. An invoice which results in the order changing to the status \"Invoiced\" automatically receives the Final invoice indicator. However, this indicator can also be set manually. This indicator is important for the order cost evaluation in order to be able to determine the closing period of an order."

The average price from the stock account is taken, if this is not available the standard price from the order reel or the material and labour costs from the production part reel. The actual costs for manual storage, JIT, KANBAN, etc. parts are also written to the items of the exploded production bill of materials when the parts request is released. It is also possible that the posting of target and actual costs is not carried out immediately. The costs are then not immediately posted to the document, but in a night run. A special feature is that the actual costs for manual stock, JIT, KANBAN, etc. parts are only written to the exploded parts list when the production order is reported complete. Data fields: The cost of the document for the calculation is written into each predecessor. In the transaction the documents for the calculation are collected in the collection\"captured.transaction\". There are the following data fields for the planned and actual costs : The data fields consist of one of the cost element and type separated by a dot Cost categories Cost types Example: stocked.estimatedCosts -> warehouse planned costs without overheads. Distribution of costs: In the valuation of the unfinished products or the complete final costing, all costs are always booked as follows The costs will be added up on the following accounts: The document to be cleared is added to the document collections of the following accounts: Which data fields are written for which document can be seen in the table below. The costs can therefore always be viewed or evaluated per accrual period on the individual order sub-items, as well as on the order header and in total on the cost unit account. All costs for stock goods are divided into standard costs and overheads. General information on cost posting in the final costing: Determination of costs for storage and retrieval Goods receipts In the final costing, a negative value is always included in the valuation for goods receipts. Goods receipts to cost objects always represent a credit (= negative debit). If a withdrawal was posted for a cost object via a purchased part, then the purchased part was converted as a production part and then a goods receipt was created as a credit, the positive withdrawal value is still in the column purchased parts from stock, the negative goods receipt value is then in the column production parts from stock. Storage of level 0 parts of internal orders does not relieve the cost unit and does not appear in the final costing. Additional orders at level 0 Incoming invoices for additional orders at level 0 order items are not charged as merchandise but as purchased parts for production."

Capacity planning in parts requirements: ClassiX® offers two options for scheduling: Capacity check CTP Usual procedure with desired detailed planning: In brief, the process is as follows: Usual procedure with sufficient rough planning Capacity test CTP Functionality The capacity is defined on the basis of given available hours within a calendar week of a work centre or resource. Each routing item that requires this work center and/or resource adds its expected capacity requirements to the workload of the work center/resource. If the booked requirement plus the requirement to be checked is greater than the planned capacity, there is a bottleneck and the capacity check returns a message about insufficient capacity. Work sequences can extend over several calendar weeks. A work sequence can be spread over several calendar weeks if it has a throughput time of 2 days and starts on a Friday. The total target time is then divided by the number of days and then multiplied by the number of days required in the current calendar week. This results in the proportionally required capacity, in this example the first week has exactly 50% of the target time, the second week also 50%. Via the editing mask of the exploded work plans, the exact booking can be displayed via context menu (Show bookings) - a new window opens with the list of booked resources with proportional capacity in the respective calendar week and a coloured box indicating whether sufficient capacity is available."

The batch number ( attribute _batchNumber) must then be defined as a characteristic of the variant part. For the individual batches, subparts are generated in which the batch numbers are marked. The subparts always have the same part number as the variant part. They also have the special feature that they are not listed in the part search. You always select the variant part first, then a separate selection mask opens for selecting the batch. Using the _dateOfExpiry attribute in the characteristics bar, you can also control whether the expiry dateof the parts is relevant. If this attribute is taken over as type characteristic, the entry of this date is mandatory when creating new batches, otherwise the entry of the expiry date is optional. In the variant part, it is necessary to select the option\"Shared Dispatching Account\", if necessary, this option must first be activated via the client. A common MRP account is necessary because the stock is to be ensured across all batches. The check mark \"Common stock account\" must NOT be set, because the stock postings may only be made via the lower parts. As a rule, batch-managed parts are stock parts and therefore have to be marked accordingly in the logistics account. In the logistics account in the group warehouse account it can be defined per option according to which criteria the stock removal should be carried out during the automatic creation (creation of a stock removal from the staging list warehouse). The option Fifo (first in first out) is preset, so that the batches that were put away first are also the batches that are removed first. The date on which the batches were created is taken into account. Alternatively, for batch-managed parts which have the attribute for the expiry date, an option can be set, according to which the batches which expire first are also those which are removed from stock first. Batch-guided parts without bearing guide: In addition to the \"normal\" batch-managed parts, where the complete logistics chain is documented and the batches in the warehouse are managed separately, it is also possible to create batch-managed parts, where the batch is only recorded once at the time of removal from storage. The document history then shows which batch numbers have been used in which orders. Batch managed parts without stock management are created as individual parts. The material characteristic of the batch number (_batchNumber) is therefore not required. Instead, the part is defined in the logistics account as a batch-managed part \"Only for stock removal\". When entering a removal from storage, the batch number must be indicated, otherwise the removal from storage cannot be posted. Several stock removal items of the same part must be created if parts of different batches are removed from stock. The procurement of a batch-managed part: With the option \"joint MRP account\", only the variant part appears in the requirements and stock list, for example, if the minimum stock level has not been reached. In the case of an order part, the requirement request or directly the order can now be created. At this point in the procurement process, the attribute of the batch number is no longer required, as the batch number is only known at the time of delivery. The first step when receiving the delivery should be to create the subpart(s) according to the delivered batches, as this is currently not yet done automatically by the goods receipt. Afterwards the goods receipt can be recorded. By selecting the order, the variant part is still drawn into the goods receipt in the first step, but the batch number can now be entered via the item. If the entered batch number leads to a lower part, this replaces the variant part in the item. This means that the lower part is addressed during the subsequent putaway. The batch number must be entered at goods receipt!."

        "output": "Construction. part trunk: The ClassiX® system distinguishes between a part and the possible roles of a part. A part itself contains the descriptive data, which can be named independently of its use. A part could for example be completely described by \"carpet\". Depending on its use, one receives further data entities or roles: If the \"carpet\" is sold, sales-specific data such as sales price is maintained in the role sales article . Further roles would be order item (with data such as main supplier, last purchase price), production part (with data such as bill of material, routing, lot size), etc. In ClassiX® any role can be assigned to a part. Furthermore, a distinction is made between ClassiX® single parts, lower parts and variant parts: The advantage of processing with variant parts is that previously non-existent versions of a part do not always have to lead to data acquisition. If, for example, a customer wants a \"carpet\" with the colour pink and a \"carpet\" of this colour has never been processed before, this \"carpet\" can be ordered as a variant part with the new pink colour directly from the supplier without entering a new order article. The characteristics list of a variant part consists of various characteristics or attributes. In our example above these were the attributes colour and size. The size attribute can also be a formula attribute, i.e. it is calculated from the attributes\"length times width\". In this case, the attributes length and width must be specified in the lower part. The variant part \"carpet\" can of course be specified more precisely by means of further features. For example, the type of material (such as wool, plastic, etc.), pile thickness (in mm), pattern, etc. One could even go so far as to define all the carpets in the world as the lower part of just one variant. To do this, however, the number of characteristics would have to be increased to a point where each carpet is sufficiently distinguishable from the others. To what extent parts with different variant parts are described - or whether variant parts are used at all - depends very much on the individual case. A DIY store may have only a few (or even only one) \"carpet\" variants, whereas a carpet manufacturer will prefer a more structured structure of his \"carpet\" variants. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"273\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}. 2. parts lists: Parts lists describe the composition of a production part. A bill of material consists of parts, which in turn can have a bill of material. Each bill of material item describes which parts are required in which quantity for the production of the manufacturing part. There are two types of item: The basic heading contains a parts master record which is required in the specified (constant or calculated) quantity. A conditional BOM item is a conditional list of individual items. When exploding the BOM, the first item whose condition is fulfilled is used. If a subpart is inserted in a parts list, its characteristics are not automatically transferred, as these parts lists do not represent master data. During further processing of the parts list in orders or similar, the master data of the individual parts \"shine through\" and can then be changed later. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. For further information on purely disposable assemblies and constructive assemblies as well as instructions for creating purely disposable intermediate stages in a variant parts list, please refer to the assembly parts list documentation. characteristics: Attributes are of central importance in ClassiX® because they make it possible to describe an object (material object, person object or similar) in all its characteristics without having to make changes to the source code.

Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. 5. release order items: With this module, sales order items are technically processed and released. A technical processing depends on the logistic identification of the part on the order item: If it is a production part, the order-specific production parts list can/should be generated for this part, if it is an order part, the requirement request can/should be made. For detailed information on use, please refer to the module documentation. time sheets: This module is used to create and maintain time sheets. Time sheets are particularly common in service industries, where it is necessary to record services for billing purposes with customers.

        "output": "Example printing (form creation). Comparison printing via MS Word with printing via XML: There are currently two printing methods, printing via MS Word and printing via XML. This section gives a first overview of how the printing methods work and their advantages and disadvantages. A more detailed description is given below. In general, printing via MS Word can be described as follows. At the beginning of the printing process, an empty Word document is created. Subsequently, the document modules assigned to the document are successively inserted into the generated empty Word document. The type or the sequence of blocks defines when and where the blocks are inserted. For example, the type \"Footer\" creates the footer of the document. The result is that the initially empty Word document is filled with content and can now be printed, saved, etc. When printing via XML, a template is stored behind the document. This specifies the layout of the printout. This can be done on the one hand by referring to the document modules to be used, but the content can also be stored directly in the template. For example, a reference can be made in the footer of the template that the document module is to be dragged to print the footer or the content can be stored directly in the footer of the template. When printing, the layout is dragged and evaluated (memorised), thereby setting the contents of all placeholders (document variables). The template is a Word XML document which is only converted into a Word document as a COM object after preparation. Create a new document for XML printing: This section shows an example of how to create a new document for printing delivery notes. Creating a document: The first step in creating a new document is to create the document itself. In this example, the document is given the number \"SDN\" and the name \"Delivery note\". The area \"Sales\" is defined in the application area and the restriction can be used to set that the document is only valid for delivery notes (class CX_DELIVERY_NOTE). {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"281\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}. Creating the template: The decisive step is now the creation of the template. The template is saved as a Word document in the directory \"CX_ROOTDIR\\appswh\\data\\Template\\Forms\\CX_PROJECT_NAME\" under the name of the document, in this case defaultTemplate.doc. The template could look something like this. It has a header and a footer with corresponding document variables, which are described in the same way. It also has two section changes and further document variables. {img fileId=\"282\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} However, there are also a few hidden document variables. If you insert a few line breaks before the first section break, you will see that the document has a different header on the following page. The same applies to the two sections defined by the section breaks. The document variables, which are described in the next table, ensure that the content is read from the document modules defined in the document and inserted at the appropriate place. Alternatively, the content could also be inserted directly into the template as described above. Thus, one could remove the document variable \"call(XMLPrintListHeader)\" for inserting the building block of the list header and define the list header here directly, as the following image shows. {img fileId=\"284\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} However, it is also possible to insert content into the template without using document modules. This is even much easier, but does not offer the possibility of encapsulating modules and using them several times. It is easier because you can insert the content directly in the template. For example, it would be conceivable to insert the list header of the position list directly in the header of the template instead of the document variable \"call(XMLPrintListHeader)\". The same applies to the document header, footer and so on. And although you do not go via the document modules in this case, document variables can still be used as placeholders for inserting ClassiX data, such as \"uniqueID\" for inserting the document number. Document modules: Document modules are used to manage Word documents that are inserted into the template. The documents must be assigned an ID, which must be unique so that the documents can be exported and imported. It is advisable to name the modules like the document into which they are to be inserted, supplemented by an abbreviation describing the type. It could also be a consecutive number, but then the ID would not be meaningful. The following extensions have been established using the example of the document \"SDN\". The type of the document module controls which task the module fulfils and where it is to be inserted. Thus, the module \"list header\" is inserted at all the places in the template where the document variable \"call(XMLPrintListHeader)\" has been defined. The Word document can be stored conditionally in the document modules. These can be fixed conditions, such as whether the module \"Header\" is to be inserted on the first page or on the following page. However, the conditions can also be formulated depending on general system information (e.g. query regarding the logged-in client) or data of the document to be printed (e.g. query regarding the order type), etc. The \"document header\" module has a special feature, which is usually always conditional. There is a condition for the first page (\"print.counter=11111\"). The document that was stored here is output as the document header. The Word document behind the condition for the next page (\"print.counter=99999\"), on the other hand, is used for the header of the next page. The advantage is that despite a uniform header across all documents on the first page, an individual document header can be set up on the following pages without the need for a document. In addition to the Word document, the module can also define options such as \"new page before the module\". However, these options are only valid for blocks of the type \"list position\" or \"list groups\" as well as the blocks which are freely inserted before or after the list. Document variables: In the MS-Word Editor the layout design for the document header can be created. If you have no experience in using MS-Word with dynamic data fields, it is recommended to first create a static layout design by defining the formatting of tables, fonts and inserted graphics (see above figure)."

        "output": "Foreign currency. Introduction: In a globalised economy one is constantly confronted with foreign languages and foreign currencies. In this section we will look at foreign currencies and describe how currencies are processed in the CyberEnterprise business OS. But first, some definitions of terms: The local currency (or standard currency) is the currency that is set as the currency of the registered client, i.e. the currency in which the client prepares his balance sheet: All internal values (e.g. all bookings and accounts of the accounting system (financial, operational and asset accounting) or statistical values such as turnover or costs) are kept in this currency. Foreign currencies are all other currencies that can be used as desired within the CyberEnterprise business OS: In transaction data (e.g. in offers, orders, invoices, etc.) and also in master data (e.g. in supplier prices, sales prices, etc.). The conversion between currencies is controlled via currency tables. The currency covered is the currency in which currency or monetary amounts are recorded in the system. The output currency is the currency in which documents (e.g. quotations, order confirmation, invoice, credit note, etc.) are printed. In outgoing and incoming invoices or in other documents whose values must be converted into the internal local currency, the output currency is also referred to as the conversion currency, since it must be taken into account here not only for the preparation of the print, but also for the transfer to the internal accounting system (e.g. when creating open items in financial accounting). In the following tables, € is the local currency and $ is any foreign currency. Foreign currencies in sales: An offer/order or invoice/credit note can only be entered in one currency. The following table lists, among other things, the effect of a foreign currency on financial accounting and its open items (see also here) In all cases, the currency details of the order can be overwritten in the invoice. For example, order type C can become an invoice of type B, if the user so specifies. Manual account assignment of invoices with foreign currencies: (see also: Manual account assignment) In case B, that is, if the invoice has been entered in the local currency but issued in a different currency, the issue currency and the exchange rate can be changed in the Manual Account Assignment window even after the invoice has been registered. If a different, possibly more up-to-date exchange rate has been agreed upon with the customer after registration but before posting in the financial accounting, this can still be maintained. If the invoice was entered in a foreign currency, the conversion rate can be changed in the manual account assignment, but not the conversion currency. Setting the: While when registering an invoice, the conversion rate must always be set if a foreign currency is used (this rate can either be set manually or is set automatically (see also here)), this can be made more open during order/invoice processing. At least you have the options whether the exchange rate should be frozen or whether the current exchange rate, defined via the global currency table, should always be used for calculation. The setting, which should be used by default, can also be set via the options. When the documents are output, the output currency and, if applicable, its exchange rate is transferred to the print template. However, the specifications can be changed here for printing. When creating a follow-on document [[Quotation -> New quotation version -> Order -> Invoice -> Credit note], the print currency and, if applicable, the exchange rate are automatically adopted. Foreign currencies in sales prices: In the section Foreign currencies as output currency (print currency) in sales it was shown which problems occur when converting from the local currency to the output currency(calculation currency of the order -conversion-> customer). In this section, the influence of a foreign currency in the sales prices on the order calculation(sales prices -conversion-> calculation currency of the order) is discussed. Local currency: currency of the client Calculation currency: The currency with which the order is calculated. (The currency specified by the net value of the order). Output currency: The currency in which the order is output (printed) and which is transferred as a foreign currency together with a frozen rate in the financial accounting. The problems to be considered include the following: The following cases thus arise for the use of sales prices in the order in different currencies. For all the above cases, € is the local currency and a fixed conversion rate of $1.25 to €1.00 is defined in the valid SALESFX. It can be defined in the client whether a currency table (SALESFX or local) must exist if the calculation currency of the order or the currency of a sales price in a foreign currency is used. If this option is set, an error message will be displayed if this is not the case. If the option is not set, the EUROFX table is used for conversion and the above-mentioned currency fluctuations occur. Foreign currencies in purchasing: In purchasing, the documents most commonly used are purchase orders and purchase invoices, where foreign currencies play a role. However, there is a significant difference between this and sales. While in sales documents (quotations, orders, A/R invoices) - at least in most cases - the sales prices are recorded in the local currency and a foreign currency + exchange rate is \"only\" used for the output of prices in print, this is different in purchasing. Here the documents themselves (order, incoming invoice) are entered in a foreign currency: An incoming invoice which is received in $, for example, should of course also be entered in $. So if an incoming invoice is entered in a foreign currency, the corresponding exchange rate MUST be indicated. The reason for this can be found in the initial account assignment, which is always made in the local currency. If the exchange rate were not frozen, there would be differences between the account assignment and the gross value if the exchange rate in the currency table were to change. An order or an incoming invoice/credit note can only be entered in one currency. The following table lists the effect of a foreign currency on financial accounting and its open items (see also here):. Foreign currencies in financial accounting: In principle, the accounts of the financial accounting are managed in the local currency, which is fixed in the client. However, it is necessary to be able to process and post outgoing and incoming invoices, outgoing and incoming payments and foreign currency accounts in different foreign currencies. A/R invoice documents and A/R credit memo documents are converted into the local currency at the time of registration (the time of automatic or later manual preassignment) (see Foreign Currencies in Sales), and the conversion rate is determined for A/P invoice documents and A/P credit memo documents when they are entered (see Foreign Currencies in Purchasing). The conversion rates already defined in the pre-defined documents are transferred to financial accounting. The further processing of automatically imported bank statements in financial accounting is described in the section Foreign Currencies in Bank Statements, but first follows a description of the processing of foreign currencies in manual postings. Foreign currencies for manual bookings: The debit or credit value of an entry can be entered in any foreign currency, as long as a conversion rate into the local currency is available. If a currency table is logged in, the exchange rate - as far as it is available in the currency table as exchange rate into the local currency - is automatically determined and the foreign currency amount is converted into an amount in local currency. This automatically determined amount can also be maintained manually by means of a special setting. Foreign currencies in bank statements: When bank statements from bank accounts with foreign currency are taken over or bank postings with incoming or outgoing payments in foreign currency are made, an immediate conversion into the local currency is carried out as a preliminary step to posting in the financial accounting. If this conversion is to take place using the date of the bank statement, this must be stored in the client."

The system works like in pharmacies by means of a card (Kanban is Japanese and means \"card\"), which is located at the bottom of a storage box. If an employee takes the last item from this box, he or she must take the card and pass it on to the purchasing department. There are then so many of these boxes in the Kanban warehouse that the minimum stock level (e.g. a full additional box) is never fallen below). If necessary, production then simply takes these goods without having to create a withdrawal document. To replenish the boxes, orders or stock orders are created and booked as normal, but in the end no goods are put into storage; the stock level always remains at that of the last inventory. The provision of production order items or spare parts orders is carried out via the usual staging lists, but no goods storage or goods withdrawals are created from here. When creating the goods withdrawal documents from the staging lists (staging status and picking list), no document is created, but the item is technically staged (written off from the system as a requirement that is no longer open) and a kanban withdrawal slip is printed immediately. Safety stock: The safety stock level (SiBe) is determined and entered manually for Kanban parts. Replacement time: The replenishment lead time for Kanban parts is determined via the preliminary parts costing. Consumption: The funding will be made available as follows. stock management+stock replenishment: For kanban parts, a main inventory is taken annually, which determines the displayed stock level of a part for the entire year. This really means that there are no posted stock movements over the year. If a card is now handed over to the dispatcher by a production worker, which means that goods must be newly procured for the part indicated on the card, the following scheme applies: The kanban part is defined by a logistics indicator."

The declaration of origin is requested from the supplier by means of an origin enquiry. The supplier declaration module supports the creation of origin requests. For example, it determines which parts have to be requested from which suppliers. The A, B, C supplier identification, parts consumption, the purchase of parts from which suppliers, etc. are taken into account in order to create only the relevant origin enquiries. Once all the information has been gathered from all the suppliers of the ordered articles, this list can be printed out quickly using a report. The next step is now the preparation of the origin requests. This is done via a function call from the supplier declaration module, in which a request is created for each supplier with the relevant order articles. After the enquiries have been created, they can also be printed and sent immediately in one. The created enquiries are stored in the system and booked with the respective supplier, order item and clerk, so that they can be found easily and quickly at a later date. If a supplier then replies to an order enquiry of the type Proof of Origin or Supplier Declaration, the last applicable and still open (i.e. still inquired) order enquiry is selected via its transaction folder and the respective reply can then be entered for all, some or only individual order items. Finally, these answers can be written back to the supplier agreement for the ordered article at the push of a button from the order request window, i.e. updated. In the supplier agreement, origin indicators are provided with a validity and a history. In this way, it is also possible to issue an origin declaration for goods produced earlier.

Unfortunately, no returns for public holidays are possible yet, so a separate operating calendar must be recorded for each production centre that has public holidays that differ from others. Edit operations calendar: The operating calendars are created by someone who has the rights to change the location-specific data in the Object-Inspector. Here, the new operating calendars are created below the federal state in which the company has its headquarters, without additional entries. Afterwards, the operating calendar to be edited can be set via the main menu \"User → Set Locale\". If the operating calendar to be edited is now set, editing can be started via the main menu \"System → Calendars → Operating calendar\". In the processing list, all public holidays are listed, including those which do not come directly from this operating calendar but are defined in higher-level operating calendars and thus inherited into the current operating calendar. These entries cannot be changed by the user. All entries added by the user appear in red letters. They can be edited and deleted.

These 20 motors and 20 control units will be provided to \"Monti\" by the ordering company \"Pumpe\" \"own\". A self-supply item is usually in the status \"Waiting demand\" after creation. Waiting demand means that a quantity of a part is to be provided which has not yet arrived in the full quantity required for provision. The 2 fundamentally different types of provision:: Supplies may be required by different departments: Furthermore, there is a distinction as to whether it is a matter of provision or external production. In the case of external production, the supplier is sent the complete bill of materials for the part, whereby he only has to do the final work and does not contribute any parts himself. See extended workbench. We manufacture a part of the entire work plan ourselves, the external supplier has practically only one job to do, i.e. we receive a production order ourselves, which we have to process ourselves up to or from the external work sequence. With the typical provision, the supplier only gets a few parts of the bill of materials - the rest is provided by the supplier. The supplier does all the work himself, we have nothing to do with production and do not even receive a production order with this provision. Manual provision creation without master information: Attention! In addition to the method listed below (standard method), there is also the following: Insert an assembly set into the sales order, the part of which is a purchased part with own provision per logistics indicator. Below the assembly set in the order, free order items are now created for the parts that are provided. During the technical release, a parts request is created and the provisions and requirement requests are automatically generated! . The standard procedure is explained here using the example of the motors in the above diagram: The staging type in the item for internal provision controls how the internal provision document is to be staged for incoming goods. However, it is always processed further using the staging status list. It is also possible to provide a self-supply document via this document itself by setting the traffic light to green in the item processing mask. The system checks whether sufficient goods have arrived and if so, the document is marked as provided. The following steps are necessary in order to provide a supplier with parts that he himself needs to manufacture the ordered part:. Customer order (level 0): The part to be provided is a. Production order (level > 0): The part to be provided is a. Automatic provision creation with master information: See also master documentation for assembly sets! There are order parts for which certain parts must always be made available (provided) to the supplier when the order is placed. These parts can be specified in the master information in so-called BOMs of material provided at the supplier. In the case of purchased parts with own provision, this is a mixed form of production part and order part, because MRP and work preparation can/must be integrated into the procurement process, since some parts may be provided that must first be produced or ordered themselves. In order to set up this type of parts and to be able to plan them successfully, the following steps are necessary: Customise master information Disposition process If a part, which is defined as a purchased part with internal provision by logistics indicator, has to be produced by the customer in a sales order, this can be marked on the exploded BOM item of the purchased part with internal provision (see description \"exploded BOM item\"). By setting the indicator, when the BOM item is subsequently exploded, the production BOM is exploded instead of the supplier BOM. A production order with all items contained in the exploded production BOM is then also created in the parts requisition for the order part with own provision."

There are basically two approaches to controlling further processing: However, if a part is now manufactured at low production capacity and purchased when bottlenecks occur, it is necessary to be able to control this further processing explicitly. In order to be able to convert a level 0 part before releasing the technology, it is only necessary to select the \"target procurement type\" via the menu Edit->Continue processing->Order/stock reservation/production order.

Thus the life cycle of a project comprises the time period from the creation of the project to the last possible point in time at which project activities can still run. Usually this is the end of the warranty. Orders end with the acceptance, i.e. the declaration of the client that a delivered product or service fulfils the contractual agreements. At this point the order is delivered and invoiced. Life cycle orders: The life cycle of an order is determined by its business processes, consisting of the invoicing (INVOICING), delivery (DELIVERY) and confirmation (CONFIRMATION) processes. Of these three processes, the confirmation process is the one that determines the end of an order by the status \"fulfilled\". The fulfilment of an order depends on the type of contract. A distinction is made here between the purchase contract and the contract for work. If an order is deemed to have been fulfilled, it can no longer be extended/modified. Costs and revenues can therefore only be incurred for the already existing scope of delivery and services. For example, an incoming invoice from the forwarding agent may arrive after the order has already been declared as completed internally. Credit notes, as an example of successors with revenue effect, can also be issued after the order has been completed. The order confirmation process is as follows: This functionality is linked to the message \"CHANGE_WARRANTY_OF_COST_OBJECTIVE\".

Conversion parts list (as a recurring process): In the case of certain, recurring, identical customer enquiries, it can make sense to produce small series of these requested parts and to keep them in stock. If this part is then requested by the customer, it can be taken directly from the warehouse and dispatched. If the customer's order differs only slightly from the stock-guided part, the stock-guided part can in some cases be converted to the desired part; e.g. the motor should have a higher power. A further, additional conversion parts list can be created for each part. This conversion parts list first contains the finished part which is to be converted. The next item on the parts list is then the part(s) that can be optionally replaced and marked with the check mark \"Conversion part\". By this you get a negative quantity in the list of the parts list items (only in the list view, the quantity remains positive!), see picture: The new part can also be added to the master bill of materials, but can also be added later in the exploded production bill of materials. Since the new part, which has already been entered in this example, has no fixed characteristic values (it is a variant part), the order attributes control which motor is actually to be installed instead of the 1.3KW motor. In the customer order the pump is now pulled in and stamped with the desired motor power, namely 2.7kW: On the technical release mask, the bill of material is now selected and exploded, but now the special bill of material PU_Umbau: In the exploded parts list the part to be removed is now marked: After creating the parts request (Gozintograph), the dispositions can be scheduled and checked for availability. The so-called back putaway parts are not included in the time chain, but are always scheduled for the completion date of the production order, because only then it is ensured that this part will be available again. If the part should or can no longer be stored after dismantling because it is broken or has gone missing during dismantling, the main disposition type on the part request position must be changed to \"no disposition\". The costs for this part are then debited to the cost object. Conversion parts list (as a one-off operation): In contrast to the recurring conversion of small series, it can also occur more frequently that conversions have to be carried out once. In this case it is unfavourable to create a master bill of material for each of these operations. For this reason it can be useful to create an empty bill of material \"CONVERSION\", which can be selected as a special bill of material as described above. After exploding this BOM, the production BOM only consists of the BOM header, which is displayed in red because no sub-items have been exploded. The next step is now to insert the part to be converted, which should be stocked. Then the part to be dismantled and the replacement part must be added. The part to be dismantled must be marked accordingly in the parts list item. So the steps that have been taken above in the master bill of materials are done directly in the production bill of materials. In this way, the special bill of materials can be used for any parts. After the production parts list has been completely defined as a conversion parts list, you can continue with the disposition as described above."

Formation of a selling price: In the simplest case the price is a simple value per quantity independent of any variable.

Via the document history, the individual processing stages of the parts with the respective serial numbers can be traced and viewed transparently. This includes, for example, information about which part of a series was stored at which storage location. But also how and when it was processed and where it was delivered to under certain circumstances. In order to define a part in ClassiX as serial number managed, the option \"Serial number managed part\" must be set via the logistics account in the group warehouse account. Serial numbers at the storage place: The identification \"Serial number managed part\" means that the serial numbers of the moving parts are carried along with the goods receipt and all stock entries. For goods receipt this is still optional under the option \"bound serial numbers\". At the latest at storage, transfer and removal from stock of serially guided parts, a recording of the serial numbers in the amount of the quantity is mandatory. When posting the documents, the serial numbers are automatically assigned to or removed from the parts warehouse account depending on the stock movement. This functionality ensures that at any time in the system it is possible to identify which serial numbers are located in which storage bins. In addition, it is possible to see how a serial number was further processed via the stock removal and its predecessors. If a part is only defined as a serial number-maintained part at a later date, manual reworking of the serial numbers and their allocation to the storage locations is also possible. Via the input window of the serial numbers under the point \"Business objects\" -> \"Insert\" -> \"Stock account part\" the part including the stock account can be defined as serial number managed part and thus serial numbers can be assigned to this part afterwards. During stocktaking, the system checks whether the number of serial numbers assigned to the partial storage bin account corresponds to the quantity counted. If this is not the case, the serial numbers of the counted parts must be assigned to the inventory item. By posting the inventory, the serial numbers on the partial storage bin account are then automatically adjusted. Serial number guided parts without stock guide: In addition to the \"normal\" serial number managed parts, where the complete logistics chain is documented and the batches in the warehouse are managed separately, there is also the possibility of creating serial number managed parts, where the serial number is only recorded once at the time of removal from stock. The document history then shows which serial number has been used in which orders. Serial number-managed parts without stock management are defined via the logistics account as serial number-managed parts \"Only on removal from stock\". When recording a removal from stock, the serial numbers must be indicated corresponding to the number of serial number-managed parts to be removed from stock, otherwise the removal from stock cannot be booked."

        "output": "Warehouse - Processes. 1. bearing guide: The warehouse management in ClassiX® consists of the individual storage locations which are assigned to the superordinate warehouses. Each warehouse must be created in ClassiX®. It describes a certain room, a certain building, which serves as a warehouse for parts. Within a warehouse, the individual storage locations must also be stored in the system as storage bins. In ClassiX®, warehouses and the storage bins they contain are not only textual information, but describe accounts with their respective stock values. A warehouse can be assigned a manager, an owner and/or a cost centre. The address of the manager is also the address of the warehouse. For further controls, the type of warehouse can be declared as a consignment, bonded or manual warehouse. Furthermore, warehouses can be marked as non MRP if the stocks in these warehouses are not to be taken into account in MRP from requirement and stock lists. The identification as a chaotic warehouse is used to have the system automatically assign an empty storage bin when goods are received. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. 1.1 Creating a new warehouse: You can create or edit new warehouses via the menu item 'Organisation warehouses'. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. 1.2 Creating storage locations: Via 'Edit - Storage bins' you can then create storage bins to which individual parts can be assigned later. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. 2. stock/requirements list: In the B&B list you can see the demand and stock of parts. For example, you can see if the minimum stock level is not reached. In the B&B list not only the current stock is evaluated but also the planned (dispositive) movements are taken into account. It is also possible to check the planned movements for their dates and, if necessary, to generate requirement requests or stock orders directly. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. incoming goods: Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. Goods receipt posting: This module is used to record goods receipts and assign them to orders. Goods receipt note: A goods receipt slip is printed for each goods receipt and passed on with the goods. The goods receipt slip contains all data from the order. If the goods have been requested for an order, the order item is printed, in the case of warehouse parts the warehouse and storage location and in the case of consumables / capital goods the cost centre/investment number. In addition, the text and any characteristics are taken from the parts master. 3.3 Unclear incoming goods: Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. storage: After posting the goods receipt or quality control, stock parts are booked to the corresponding stock account. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. removal: Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. relocation: You can transfer goods from one storage bin to another. The storage bins do not have to be in the same warehouse. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. 7. quality assurance: Recording of the quality assurance documents. All goods receipt items which are subject to QA at the time of posting must be checked by the quality assurance department before they can be put into storage. QS obligatory means that they bear the QS mark on the part or on one of the requisition, purchase order or goods receipt documents at the specified time. The indicator is frozen during posting, so that subsequent changes do not generate errors in the workflow. On the delivery schedule of a QA part order, the quantity still to be inspected is saved when the goods receipt is posted (inAssurance.quantity). This quantity is reduced by the inspected quantity when a subsequent QA document is posted. The storage account also shows this quantity still to be checked. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. provision: In order to be able to deliver products to customers or to be able to produce in a manufacturing plant at all, it must be guaranteed that the parts required for this are available at the right place at the desired time: This is called provision. This module is used for the display/further processing of parts to be provided or already provided within the logistics supply chain in a company. On the one hand, it is possible to differentiate between external demand triggers (sales order items) or internal demand triggers (storage and production orders). (For further selection options according to storage bins or only open documents, see below) A provision must therefore be made not only for the dispatch of goods, but also within the company within the framework of production. To be provided: Depending on the logistical identification (purchased or manufactured part) and the type of provision (non-stock-keeping or stock-keeping with corresponding special forms such as JIT, etc.) of a part, parts are supplied to the logistical business process from The programmatic execution of the provision from purchase requisitions - carried out by employees of the incoming goods department - and the provision from production orders - possibly carried out by employees of a final inspection - are not absolutely necessary, but they facilitate the control over the whereabouts of parts. The provision from stock reservations - carried out by employees of the warehouse - leads in the standard system to the creation of stock withdrawal documents (stock removal documents). If the corresponding programme steps for provision have been carried out, the part requests are automatically transferred to the next state (status): Provided: Analogous to the states of the parts to be provided, the following states result here The state \"dispatch\" stands for those parts which are sent directly from the warehouse to dispatch for customer orders. (The part is kept in stock and the requirement trigger is a customer order) Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. 9. stock list / evaluation: In this window you can get a quick overview of the current stock levels, the stock level of the last or the annual inventory.

        "output": "Purchasing - processes. order item: A purchase order item or purchasing service manages all information relevant to purchasing. In order to be able to order parts, order item reels are assigned to parts that hold all the information relevant to the order. Purchasing services, such as services used for external operations, are in principle structured in exactly the same way as a normal purchase order item. For detailed information on use, please refer to the module documentation. 2. terms and conditions of purchase: Fixed terms and conditions of business can be easily integrated into requests for quotations and orders or can be linked to the supplier base by including them in the terms and conditions of the individual suppliers. Via the menu bar and the item 'Basic data - Terms and conditions - Purchasing', new terms and conditions can be created or edited for the items specified there. Terms of payment: In ClassiX® payment terms can belong to both purchase and sale. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. Partial payments: In addition to the usual payment conditions, such as 14 days 2% discount / 30 days net, it is possible to create partial payment conditions in the system. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. Discounts: With this module you can define discount rates and then apply them to enquiries or orders Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. Packaging: With this module you can define surcharges for packaging, in order to subsequently include them in enquiries or orders. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. Freight: With this module, you can define texts for freight charges in order to subsequently transfer them into enquiries or orders. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. Pricing: With this module, you can, for example, define recurring types of pricing in order to subsequently transfer them to enquiries or orders. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. Shipping method: With this module, you can define different shipping methods in order to subsequently include them in enquiries or orders. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. 2.8 Warranty: With this module, you can define various warranty texts, which you can then use in enquiries or orders. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. Delivery time: With this module you can define different texts for the delivery times, in order to use them afterwards in enquiries or orders. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. 3. stock/requirements list: In the B&B list, one can view the demand and stock of the parts. For example, you can see whether the stock falls below the minimum level. However, not only the current stock is evaluated in the B&B list, but also the planned (MRP) movements are taken into account. It is also possible to check the planned movements for their deadlines and, if necessary, to generate requisitions or stock orders directly. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. requirement request: Purchasing is prompted by the requisitions to trigger orders. Every employee of the company can create requisitions. Four types are distinguished: Personal use (consumables or capital goods) must be approved by a supervisor. Customer and warehouse requirements are automatically approved if the \"Approval\" checkbox is not selected. In order to have a requisition approved by a superior or to forward it directly to the purchasing department, it must be posted. The posting cannot take place automatically, as otherwise the approver/purchaser would receive the requirement coverage request before it has been checked by the processor. It is also important to note that requirement coverage requests of the type internal requirements can only be posted if a cost centre has been specified there for which the internal requirements are requested. A requirement coverage request of the type customer requirement must have a predecessor, that is, a cost object, in order to describe it completely. A further special feature must also be taken into account in any case, namely that quantities which have been ordered for internal use, i.e. for a specific cost centre, are not displayed on the warehouse account in the total \"In Goods Receipt\" or \"In QA\" after goods receipt, as this ordered quantity is not intended for general \"dispositive\" consumption but only for the specified cost centre! For detailed information on usage, please refer to the module documentation. 4.1 Approve a requirement request: Requisitions that have been submitted are displayed by user operations in the \"Requisitions to be approved\" folder of the approver. You can expand this folder up to each individual requirement request item or open it by double-clicking it. 4.2 Creating a requirement request via the stock/requirements list: You can generate a requirement coverage request directly from the stock/requirements list by selecting the relevant lines in the list and clicking on 'Create new requirement coverage request'. enquiry: Purchase requisitions are needed to determine the price of one or more items. It can also be used to request proof of origin from the respective supplier. The requests for the respective information can be created individually or together. Purchase requisitions can be generated from the Approved Requisitions window and the Automatic Purchase Requisitions window or entered manually. A price comparison between individual items can only be carried out for generated requests that have been requested from several suppliers. For detailed information on usage, please refer to the module documentation. order: For detailed information on use, please refer to the module documentation. 6.1 Convert approved requirement coverage request into purchase order: A distinction is made between four types of requisition request: Personal use (consumables or capital goods) must be approved by a supervisor. Customer and warehouse requirements are automatically approved if the \"Approval\" checkbox is not selected. The approved requisitions are automatically distributed to the individual purchasing staff members, since each purchase order item has been assigned to a purchasing area (\"Purchasing area\" field in the purchase order item window) and the purchasing areas have been assigned to the purchasing staff members(structure PURCHASING_GROUPS \"Purchasing areas\"). For detailed information on usage, please refer to the module documentation. 6.2 Extend order: If the order quantity is expanded or combined, it must be assigned to an order item or, for storage requirements, in a new requirement request. This assignment then identifies the order quantity in the order status as an order part for order, warehouse or cost centres. 6.3 Linking requirement request with order item: In the system, a delivery schedule of an order item can be subsequently linked to a requirement request item. This is useful, for example, if the requirement coverage request has been deleted or a purchase order already exists in the system without a link to a requirement coverage request. For subsequent linking, the requirement request and the delivery schedule editing mask must be opened. The requirement request item is then dragged into the delivery schedule line; the system then links the items in a document chain and reposts the requirement request item accordingly. 7. delivery date confirmation: This window is used for the fast entry of delivery date confirmations from suppliers for the orders. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. reminders: Suppliers can be reminded if they have either not responded to the requested price request or have not submitted the requested supplier declaration. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. printing: With the button 'Print, Fax, E-Mail.' you can print your enquiries, orders, reminders etc. The window 'Print order' will then open, for example. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"460\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Click on 'Document' to open the list of all documents assigned to the document type. With 'Preview' you can view the document before printing. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"462\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} For orders, there is the menu item 'Activities - Print - Print orders'. With this item it is possible to print several orders at the same time. incoming invoice / incoming credit notes: Via the menu item \"Activities -> Purchasing -> Incoming invoices/incoming credit notes\" you can enter incoming invoices. The basis for this is the assignment of the invoice items to the delivery schedule items so that the entry runs as automatically as possible. Then the invoice values and possibly the conditions that deviate from the purchase order have to be entered and the invoice has already been entered in the ClassiX® system. (incoming invoice document) The first audit took place at that time. If items in the item list are marked with a stop sign, these items cannot be released automatically, but are set to the status \"to be checked\" when the invoice is forwarded. Above all, however, he can also use the incoming invoice status window. Here the inspector can display his items to be inspected and also gets an immediate overview of the items which can be released immediately. If an item has three green checkmarks, the cause of the check is already solved by itself. (If, for example, a GR has been carried out, etc.) (Docu Incoming Invoice Status Window) Now that all items have been released, the incoming invoice header is also automatically released. The last step is the posting of the incoming invoices to the financial accounting. The invoice receipt book serves this purpose. In addition to the function of the selection window (selection of the invoices to be posted) and the statistics, the initial account assignment of the invoices can be changed manually. (Docu Incoming Invoice Book). 11. view order status: Via the menu item 'Evaluation - Purchasing - View order status', the window 'Order items (all)' opens. Via the item 'Edit' you can have the orders filtered. incoming goods/direct delivery/interim storage: Docu goods receipt / direct delivery / intermediate storage Via the menu item 'Logistics -> Goods receipt' you can enter a new goods receipt. The basis for this is always a purchase order, so no goods receipt can be entered without a purchase order predecessor. On the one hand, the goods receipt serves to report the completion of a purchase order, which also removes it from the MRP account, but on the other hand, it also serves to provide or store the goods. Thus, the goods receipt is also a central point in the MRP chain. A direct delivery is recorded when the goods are not sent to the branch itself but directly to the construction site. In this case, the order is also reported ready, but the goods cannot be put into storage, for example. Another difference is that I cannot create a quality assurance document for a direct delivery. Intermediate storage is used when a commodity ordered from a supplier is to be delivered directly to a packaging company and from there to the customer. quality assurance: Quality assurance documentation Quality assurance must be carried out for a goods receipt if the part is a QA part or if the indicator \"Forced QA inspection\" has been set in a document of the document history (requisition, purchase order, goods receipt). The buyer can set this flag, for example, if he expects defective goods in advance, or the person recording the goods receipt if the first defects are already visible at the goods receipt. Only when quality assurance has been carried out for incoming goods to be inspected can the incoming goods be further processed (putaway/provision). return document: Return document A return document can follow a goods receipt, direct delivery or QS document. On the item, the defects that have occurred can then be indicated and how the goods are to be further processed (new delivery, etc.). The return document can also be printed out and then serves as a (return) delivery note. The order goes back to the \"open\" state by entering a return document, which allows a new goods receipt to be entered. 15. supplier's declaration: Docu supplier declaration. 16. account assignment / initial account assignment: Docu account assignment / preliminary account assignment. purchase pricing: Docu purchase pricing. supplier evaluation: Docu supplier evaluation. 1. introduction: A complete call-off order typically includes It is still possible to enter several order items per order, namely normal order items and/or call-off order items mixed as desired. By definition, normal order items only contain normal delivery schedules. However, as soon as an order item includes an \"on call\" delivery schedule, we implicitly speak of a release order item, without the system making an explicit distinction at order item level. A call-off order item can also contain several \"on call\" delivery schedule lines. For each of these \"on-call\" delivery schedule lines, delivery schedule lines for released quantities can then be entered. However, the system (in the current version) does not link the latter with the corresponding \"on-call\" delivery schedule line, which is why this affiliation is not visible on the corresponding masks. In addition to the delivery schedule lines for released quantities, normal delivery schedule lines and delivery schedule lines independent of the release order can also be entered. In the current version of the system, however, no distinction is made between the two types of normal delivery schedule lines. Tip: Due to the current system restrictions, it is recommended for the sake of clarity that per release order item to be recorded. 2. registration: Recording of \"on call\" delivery schedules Procedure for entering an \"on call\" delivery schedule: Recording of delivery schedules for quantities called off Procedure for recording the delivery schedule for a released quantity:. account assignment: Order item On the processing screen for order items the total current open release quantity of all \"On Release\" delivery schedules of the order item is displayed in the field Release (Slot expected.quantity: by code, not by transaction descriptions). In addition, the total ordered (i.e. already called off) quantity is displayed in the Ordered field (calculated online = total quantity - open call-off quantity). Parts Disposition Account The open call-off quantities of all \"on call\" delivery schedule lines are assigned to an account in the parts disposition account. The corresponding balance is displayed in the MRP stock line with type = \"On call, open\" (slot called.quantity). In the MRP stocks line with type = \"Ordered\" (slot placed.quantity) the balance of all normal delivery schedules, i.e. all delivery schedules for released quantities and all delivery schedules independent of release orders, is shown. Business process order \"On call\" Delivery schedules only know the status \"On call\" (PO_CALL). This status is assumed when saving for the first time after the entry."

Here, the text articles are in constant competition with the unspecified variant parts. The text articles represent the typical disposable article, which is really only sold rarely and/or only once. In contrast, the unspecified variant part can only be precisely defined in the order, but is nevertheless often sold in a similar form. For example, an unspecified variant part could be a PC with a purchasing role to determine a main supplier. Capture of text articles: The entry of text article items in the order or quotation begins like the entry of each item via Insert - Item - \"corresponding type\". The difference is that no article is inserted. If you now save the item, a text article is automatically created. In addition, the field in which the article is normally displayed is replaced by a field for entering a short term. Since no master information is available for the text article, the information of the order item must now be entered manually. Apart from the price, one of the most important factors here is the article description, since otherwise the item will appear largely empty in the press proof and no one will know which article it is in the further processing.

        "output": "Variant parts. Variant parts: In ClassiX® a variant part is a description for an actually occurring part, a pattern for a distinct part. This description includes - as for any other part - an identifying number, a description, various details, such as logistic and dispositive identification, etc. However, a variant part is also described by means of a list of characteristics. This list of characteristics defines the characteristics or quantities whose different values or characteristics can be used for an actual part. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"320\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} If you give a value for the length and a value for the width of our sheet metal with the number 4711, then such a part is described completely exactly. Although only one (variant) part is specified (\"sheet 4711\"), by additionally specifying the values of the characteristics, it is possible to describe different characteristics of one and the same variant part and thus define different, exactly described parts. A variant part can thus be used like any other part in the system, with the difference that all values for characteristics in the characteristics list must always be specified. The advantage now is that a variant part only has to be defined once in the system, only once as master information in the part master. Nevertheless, a large number of different versions of this variant part are available for further processing in the DP system. If you need sheet metal 4711 in length=100mm and width=50mm, but at another time you need the same sheet metal in length=30mm and width=12mm, you have to enter values for length and width, but you always use the other information of the variant part already stored in the system. In principle, the characteristics of a variant part - as in our example of the sheet metal - can take any value, but valid value ranges can be assigned to the characteristics or attributes. Lower and individual parts: As we have seen, variant parts make particular sense when you are dealing with \"equal\" parts of the most varied characteristics/dimensions/performance. However, if some characteristics (keyword \"standard sizes\") of a variant part are used very often, it makes sense to store them as independent parts in the part master. A subpart must hold all attributes of the characteristics bar. Assuming that the two sheets of type 4711 with the dimensions 100/50 and 50/40 are frequently required, they are created in the parts master and assigned to the variant part as so-called lower parts. These subparts can also have the same part number as the variant part, but they must each have different values for the attributes length and width. As a rule of thumb, a variant part should always be created as a subpart in the system if it is kept in the warehouse. In ClassiX®, parts in the part master, which are neither variants nor subparts, are called individual parts. Individual parts can also be specified more precisely via their attributes, but these attributes are only for information purposes. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"322\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}. Specifications: Specifications are automatically generated by the system if variant parts for which there is no distinct lower part are to be booked into the warehouse as surplus or remaining quantity. Part Rolls: Like all other parts in ClassiX®, variant parts can also have different rolls. Specifications as purchase part are described and stored in the purchase role, prices for sale in the sales role, etc. Subparts always also use the role information of the variant part assigned to them, unless they themselves have such a role object. In our example the part 4711/length=50mm and width=40mm has its own purchase role, but uses the sales role of the assigned variant part. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"324\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}. Examples: In these examples typical schemes for the use of variant parts are shown.

        "output": "Multilingual dictionary. Morpheme: The overview begins with the smallest meaningful unit of a language, the so-called morphemes. A morpheme can also be described as the smallest semantically interpretable element of a word, i.e. a word consists of one or more morphemes.{img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"332\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Morphemes are phonetically realised as phonetic sound sequences (in units of a sound system (phonetics)), phonologically as phoneme sequences (in units of the speech system (phonology)), in writing as grapheme sequences (in units of a writing system). These sequences of sounds, phonemes or graphemes represent the morpheme in certain environments; the sounds, phonemes and graphemes themselves do not carry any meaning of their own but, as building blocks of the morpheme, only have a meaning-differentiating function. Words: A word or a combination of words is (only) the linguistic expression of a term or the direct designation of a term via its meaningful morpheme. While the term contains the mental idea of the object or fact it designates (the meaning), the designation is the linguistic sign that refers to the intended object or fact (the name). It consists of a word(one-word denomination), e.g. dog(Simplizium) or dog owner (Kompositum), or a group of words(multi-word denomination), e.g. Faraday cage. On the one hand, meaning is the knowledge of the usual use of a word or expression within a language community and a given context. Meaning is also considered to be what someone understands on the basis of a sign or a linguistic expression. A word can have one meaning (univok) or several (equivok). Univocity is the unambiguousness of the relationship between word (sign) and meaning. If there is no uniqueness, a word is ambiguous (equivok). This equivocality in a broader sense is the ambiguous relationship between sign and signified. In a narrower sense, equivok is only used to refer to words that have the same sound but different meanings. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"338\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Equivocality (ambiguity) in a broader sense occurs as homonymy (like-name), synonymy (like-sense) or analogy. If a linguistic expression (word, sign) with the same name has several meanings (pre-ambiguous relationship), one speaks of a homonym (in the broader sense) or of an equivalent expression (in the narrower sense) (example: \"bank\" for financial institution or seating furniture). In some cases, a homonymy (eponym) is only used if the origin of the word is different (example: \"Tau\" for rope coming from the Low German and for damp precipitation from the Old High German tou). This homonymy in the narrower sense is then distinguished from polysemy (ambiguity of a word with identical word origin) (example: \"horse\" for animal and gymnastic apparatus). Synonyms are different linguistic expressions with the same meaning (examples: \"grandpa\" = \"grandfather\"; \"white horse\" = \"grey horse\"). The synonymy is a post-unambiguous relationship between sign and designated. In addition to this term of synonymy in the narrower sense, synonymy (then in a broader sense) is also used in the case of words that are only related in meaning. Strict synonymy requires not only that two lexical signs have the same denotative meaning, but also that they are interchangeable in all contexts and have the same effect in all contexts. Examples of strict synonymic pairs in German are, according to general opinion: orange - orange; match - match; couch - sofa; helicopter - helicopter. A homoionym (also called partial synonym) is often confused with the widely used synonym. A homoionym would be, for example, \"car\" and \"motor vehicle\", as it is not interchangeable in every context: The opposite of synonymy is antonymy (beautiful/ugly; cold/hot). The analogy is a special case of ambiguity and \"exists when the various designated objects are in a certain relationship of dependence on each other or have a certain equality of structures\". A homograph or homoglyph is a word from a group of words which all have the same spelling but different meanings and often a different pronunciation. (Reindeer as animal and as person). With the same pronunciation it is also a homophone.). Terms: Terms are related to each other in various ways. The generic term of a term is called a hyperonym, the subordinate term a hyponym.(Vegetable is a hyperonym of beans, tomato is a hyponym of vegetable). There are no limits to the number of levels(an animal is a hyponym of a mammal, a dog is a hyponym of an animal, a basset is a hyponym of a dog). {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"334\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} The thesaurus standards DIN 1463-1 or the international equivalent ISO 2788 provide for the following types of relations and associated abbreviations:. Languages: Language here is the verbal communication of people, consisting of words (of a vocabulary). Ferdinand de Saussure conceived language as a sign system and conceived the language sign as a compelling connection between the sound image (signifiant = the signifying) and the imagination (signifié = the signified), i.e. as something mental. A grammar puts the words in relation to each other. Words of different languages can be brought into a direct connection by their common meaning. The words \"tree\" and \"árbol\" are three different words with the same meaning. A written language represents a language using a writing system. Type systems: The main writing systems fall into the 4 categories: Logograms, syllable writing, alphabets, phonetic transcriptions:. The object-oriented model in ClassiX®: The abstraction of the above mentioned terms leads to the following modelling: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"336\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} One of the characteristics of a language (a language system) is that it defines its graphic and phonetic transcription systems for the (spoken) words. A word is first defined in its relation to a language and its relation to a graphic transcription chosen in that language. The word element contains the graphic representation of the spoken word. A word also has N relations to meanings, which, however, are further specified via property elements. The grammar rules: By adding additional information to a word - such as part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), numerus (singular, plural, pluraletantum, etc.), case, genus, etc. - the words and all their characteristics are automatically output by means of fixed grammar rules for the individual languages: in the case of nouns, for example, with the specific article, the singular and plural form, as well as the declension."

A new production part can be created in two ways: From the input window of the parts master via menu item New button in the editing / list window of the production part If the production part is called up from the input window of the part master, the system first checks whether a roll of this type already exists and displays it if necessary. Otherwise a new production part is created and connected to the part master (only after saving). On the tab 'Production data' the data from the part master are taken over, which must be supplemented by the missing points. With the second option, a new part master record is created for the production part when saving, which you should maintain afterwards. A production part can be defined as a normal assembly (part has a bill of material and routing), factory assembly (part has no bill of material, only a routing), MRP assembly (the production part has its own MRP bill of material and is only defined from a logistics point of view) or engineering assembly (the part is not \"seen\" from a logistics point of view).

Selection window: This window is used to select a production part. Option window: All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed with the \"OK\" button. Production cost allocation or calculation: As a matter of principle, the production costs for a part are divided into two cost areas that are valued differently: Wage costs and material costs. The costs of a production part, taking into account all the necessary wage and material costs on the basis of the master parts lists and routings, are taken over by the preliminary parts calculation. As a standard, the additional costs incurred in addition to wages and materials, e.g. for purchasing or stock management of the required parts, are included in the overheads. These are stored globally in the client. However, the following approach is preferable in order to be able to calculate production costs precisely according to other costs incurred during production, such as machine running costs and programming costs, without having to include all costs invisibly in overheads: In the part or at the work plan position, a material characteristic must be defined which contains the costs for e.g. the machine costs per hour according to the following format costs = 120€/h (see below in the picture in the work sequence). You must therefore create a material characteristic for each cost element. The characteristic can also be stored directly on variant parts and can also calculate itself there from other boundary conditions (calculated or conditional characteristics). To be able to take these costs into account, a formula in the resource of the work sequence is necessary (in the picture the standard costs of the working group): Standard costs = formula = costs+(40€/1h) Since the formulae do not know any compound units, instead of 40€/h --> write 40€/1h and put this in brackets. The machine costs per hour specified via the material characteristic are now added to the standard machine costs per hour. In order to check whether the costs are actually there without any error occurring, the formula can be extended by a query as follows In this case, the system queries in advance whether the costs have been found and otherwise uses the value 0?, whose unit is based on the next component for further calculation. In the preliminary parts calculation we then immediately see the result: The marked line is our work sequence, which has received wage costs of 1.600€ for 600 minutes (10 hours) (120€ machine running costs + 40€ standard costs = 160€ per hour * 10 hours = 1600€).

        "output": "Construction contract: This module is used to maintain production orders. The items of a production order determine with quantity and date all the parts that are to be produced in the company itself. In general, production orders with their positions are automatically generated from the parts request. Thereby only one production order (a collective order) is generated from a parts request (with the exception of latecomers), whose positions then define the parts to be produced. (After releasing a parts request, you automatically branch to the processing mask of the generated production orders).New production order items can also be opened manually (i.e. production order items without a predecessor), in which case the input option for assignment to a cost centre opens automatically.A work plan must always be defined for each individual production order item. This is generally generated production-specific from the master routing(Explode routing). In the same step the respective start and end times of each work sequence are determined by means of backward scheduling, taking into account the controlled throughput times. The automatically determined end dates as well as the lead times can be manually adjusted for each individual work sequence. Input window: This window is used to maintain production orders. You can select a production order by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". The items of a production order are displayed in the lower list window. You can revise these production order items by double-clicking them in the window 'Production order items'. With the right mouse button it is possible to switch to the routings and revise them. Change of dates: The dates of production orders that have already been fully booked and possibly already started and even partially completed can be changed subsequently via the menu Edit/End dates. Changes to the production work plan after posting the work times: If a routing is to be changed after the production order has been released, an individual item can be booked out, changed and booked in again by using the context menu (right mouse button on selected item in the item list), menu item \"Item - Book out\". While the position is booked out, it remains in the status \"Stopped\". It is now possible to make changes to the work plan. After successfully changing a task list or creating a new task list, the item can participate in the business process again. The work times must now be booked in again, which returns the status of the item from \"Stopped\" to its original status. To change the work plan, only the item needs to be booked out and opened as described above. Afterwards new work sequences can be added or deleted on the tab \"Work plan\". By double-clicking, you can directly access the editing mask of the work sequence, on which its data can then be changed. Using the arrow keys next to the list, the sequence of operations can be changed as required. The list is not sorted. However, it is only possible to change the routing of a production order item as long as it has not been staged: the staged quantity is then already written to the triggering requirement. If you want to remove work sequences for which PDC confirmations have already taken place, you can either set these work sequences to \"completed\" with a possible remaining time that has not yet been reported, or you can change the status of the work sequence directly from the worklist to \"completed\". If, after processing, the total time of all work sequences of a production order item is longer or shorter than planned in parts scheduling, the production order item (or the work centre times) cannot be posted because the throughput times on the production order and parts request differ. In order to correct this it is possible to mark in the parts request the parts request item belonging to the changed production order item and to transfer the lead time resulting from the sum of the work sequences to the parts request item via the menu \"Edit - MRP - Determine procurement time - Set selected - Dynamic\". Due to the now changed throughput time of one production order item, a gap in the workflow across all production order items is created. For this reason, the scheduling of the entire parts requirement must now be rescheduled with the new throughput times. For this purpose the scheduling type \"rescheduling\" must be selected. Already scheduled items are not affected by this rescheduling. After rescheduling, the parts request can then be released and the work times can be booked back into the production order. Via the menu \"Edit - Check - Changed dates\" it can be checked after rescheduling whether the rescheduling had effects on subsequent documents such as further production order items or requirement coverage requests. All Explained in keywords, the change in the work sequences looks like this:. Graphical scheduling of work plan positions: It is also possible to change the dates of work sequences in the graphical scheduling of the part request. The work plan does not need to be booked out (it is not possible to delete or add work sequences, only to change the lead time or the start and end dates). Graphical scheduling can be called up via the menu item \"Edit - Capacity - Graphical scheduling\". Whether there is sufficient capacity for the exploded routings can be checked via the menu item \"Edit - Capacity - Capacity check of all / selected items\". If all routings are to be checked, no item or all items must first be selected. More information about graphical scheduling and capacity check See also calendar of operations Subsequent changes to parts list items below production order items After changing a bill of material item which is located below a parts request item to be produced, the production order item receives an indicator (date) that the papers must be reprinted. This date can be seen in the production order processing mask in the penultimate column and in the worklist in the 2nd column. It disappears again after \"real\" printing of the production papers. For the further procedure when subsequently changing parts list items, see here. List window: Used to list the production orders. Selection window: This window is used to select a production order. Progress of work: This window is used to display the work progress of a production order. The \"Error\" column indicates as a number (bit pattern) the error code when data is transmitted from the PDA: // bit 0 = 1: multiple start events on the same day // bit 1 = 2: start event after end event // bit 2 = 4: Pause message after multiple starts (automatic break event with multiple starts) // bit 3 = 8: Pause message without start message (break/end event without start event) // bit 4 = 16: unknown BDE message (wrong event) // bit 5 = 32: multiple end events. Option window: Each time the production order window is opened, the options described here are reset to the default settings. External work sequences Assistant: Using the assistant of the external work sequences, total quantities can be automatically assigned for the selected items, from which orders and own supplies of the superordinate parts can be created.

Printed production order items: This window is used to search for production order items printed today (or on another date that can be set). From this list, the withdrawals for all marked orders can be generated in summary form and the material accompanying sheets of the production orders can be printed. This evaluation list is opened by the warehouse every day to see which warehouse reservations need to be made, without the need for production to run to the warehouse with a production paper to tell people which order is to be produced now. Technical provision:: If a production order is provided, the production order is connected with all its parts list predecessors via the connection transfered.predecessors/transfered.successors. This is necessary so that individual parts list items can also be provided, for example, if several predecessors have been combined in a parts request and now only a single order item is to be provided. If the macro PROVIDE_PRODUCTION_ORDER_ITEM is called up with a BOM item, only the quantity of the BOM item is marked as staged, and only this quantity is allocated to ONLY the direct order predecessor (if available) as a staged quantity.

Now, these goods can no longer be assigned to a particular goods receipt, but it must still be possible to return them to the supplier who most probably delivered this part. This is the function of the complaint document. This can be created directly for a stock removal or optionally also for a quality assurance document that has a stock removal as its predecessor. If the goods are expected back from the supplier, this can be activated with the checkbox \"Goods are expected back\", this complaint behaves like an order. The quantity is displayed in the dispatch account until the complete delivery. It may also be the case that the goods have been ready for some time at the customer and only then the customer discovers that the goods are defective and sends them back. In this case, there is the possibility to search for the original goods withdrawal document on the complaint document using the order number. A link to a goods withdrawal document is always advisable, as this is the only way to ensure that the material flow and cost distribution is 100% correct and remains traceable for later. Since a withdrawal document is not always available, for example in the case of Kanban or manual warehouse parts without warehouse management, it is also possible to attach the complaint document directly to an order header so that the flow of goods can be assigned at least to one order or cost object. The return loop is also fully integrated for this document, i.e. if a goods receipt is not perfect according to this complaint document, it is immediately sent back via a return document. The difference between the return document and the complaint document is The complaint document always refers to a goods removal The return document must refer to a goods receipt as a predecessor. The return document can therefore only be used if the disposition process of the part is not yet completed due to a QA or missing goods putaway or staging. If this process has already been completed, there is still the possibility to send the goods back via the complaint document. Business Process If no quality assurance document has been created for the removal from storage, the quantity made available is deducted from the parts requisition item/order item that may have been placed before the goods are removed. It can now be removed again via the staging list. If the goods receipt now arrives for an item that has already been made available in the meantime by another withdrawal, the status of the goods receipt changes to \"goods putaway\" and must be put away. If the item has not yet been removed again, the goods receipt goes to the status \"Ready\". In the case of partial quantities (requirement has already been partially covered), the goods receipt first goes to the status \"staging\", but after staging its partial quantity it changes to the status \"putaway\" so that the remaining quantity can be put away. The cost object is then credited by the goods receipt. If the complaint document was not expected back, the crediting of the cost unit can take place via an incoming credit note. Incoming credit notes for complaints: It is possible to request a credit note for a complaint, especially if the goods complained about are not expected to be returned. This credit note is to be recorded differently from credit notes received on the basis of return documents, as these are recorded via the order preceding the return document.

Instructions for printing order reminders can be found here. General information on generating reminders: The following dunning types (order confirmation, goods receipt, deadline saving, credit memo receipt) are generated via a common mask(generate dunning notices). Calling up this mask controls which type of dunning notices are generated and offers the optimum search for the order items to be dunned for the respective type. The respective search options are described in the following four sections. Reminder order confirmation: The search screen is initialized with the following search filters:. Dunning letter goods receipt: The search screen is initialized with the following search filters: Order items that have been blocked or whose supplier has a block are found during the search but are overlooked when the reminders are created. Term protection: The search screen is initialized with the following search filters: Purchase order items whose supplier has a deadline protection block are found during the search but are overlooked when reminders are created. When saving deadlines, the dunning date is set on the purchase order item so that the items in the waiting period are not proposed for dunning again, but the dunning level remains unaffected. Reminder for credit notes received: follows. Input window: The input window is used to process generated reminders. If it is only discovered after generation that, for example, an incorrect address or correspondence address has been drawn, the data can be edited here. List window: Generated reminders can be found and accessed via the list window. In addition, reminders can be selected by multiple selection and transferred together to the print mask. Thus the list window also controls the mass printing. Create reminders: Order confirmation and goods receipt reminders can be generated automatically via this window, depending on which menu item the mask was called up via. The type of reminders that are generated can be recognised by the window designation, among other things. The generation of reminders starts with the selection of the order items to be reminded. Depending on the type of dunning notices to be generated, a preselection of the order items takes place. This means that only order confirmation reminders can be generated for order items which have the status \"Order triggered\" and \"AB dunned\". The dunning notices for goods receipts have the status \"purchase order initiated\", \"AB dunned\", \"purchase order confirmed\", \"GR dunned\" and \"partially delivered\". A second and third filtering can now be done individually by the search criteria in the list header and by removing individual order items from the list. The search can be started on the one hand by the sum character and on the other hand by triggering in one of the search fields. If the search is started via a search field, this filter always applies together with the order status type selected in the group (all, due, open). If the search is started via the sum symbol, only this restriction applies. The reminder process is now started by clicking on the \"Reminders\" button. In the first step the reminders are generated internally and in the second step the generated reminders are transferred to the print mask. The reminders can now be printed out. Important! At the time the print mask was opened, the reminders were generated, the reminder level of the order item was counted up and the last reminder date was set. If for some reason the printout is not started, the printout must be started at a later time via the list window of the reminders. Keyword dunning block: Delivery schedules can be provided with a reminder block. This is done either via the \"Dunning data\" button in the order item or via an already created reminder by double-clicking on the order predecessor. If the checkbox Dunning block is set, the delivery schedule is still displayed in the dunning proposal list. This makes it possible to see which delivery schedules are open and should be dunned, but do not appear in any dunning notice. These are ignored when the reminders are created.

        "output": "Order: When creating an order, great care must be taken to ensure that it is also created cleanly. This means, among other things, that an order of the type OWNER'S REQUIREMENT also absolutely needs a cost centre so that the type is completely \"pronounced\" and the corresponding costs can also be assigned accordingly.Attention own requirements! Goods that are ordered as own requirements do not end up in the warehouse or in customer provision! It is only to be used for real own requirements (office supplies, swivel chairs)! With the type CUSTOMER REQUIREMENT it is also essential to specify a predecessor, i.e. a cost unit, so that the costs are also allocated there accordingly. An order is only completely created, i.e. it gets the status triggered, if these conditions have been satisfied. If these conditions are not met, the order can neither be processed in subsequent documents nor printed. Vendor purity: Each purchase order that is generated is supplier-pure. This means the following in detail: Note: If orders are created \"by hand\", supplier purity cannot be guaranteed. In this case, the user himself is responsible for the purity of the order!. Determining the supplier: When orders are created automatically, the principle is usually to determine the A supplier as the supplier from whom orders are to be placed. In detail, the following steps are used to try to determine a supplier. If a step delivers a supplier, this supplier is included in the order and the following steps are no longer taken into account. Document settings: The presetting of the voucher runs in three stages. The first stage here is the initialisation of the mask without an order. This step is very straightforward, as all fields are cleared and only the logged-in user is set as the processor. The second stage is the creation of the order by saving the order for the first time. Here, the standard document settings are used, which can be stored for the user, the user's cost centre or the client. This could be, for example, the cover letter or standard conditions of the client. It should be mentioned that fields that are filled are not overwritten. For example, if the field \"1st signature\" was set before the first saving, it will not be overwritten by the value of the field \"1st signature\" of the document settings. The third stage is to select the supplier. Here, for example, predefined fields such as vendor (specification in the vendor master) or address (P.O. Box address before street address) are filled. In addition, the standard document settings of the supplier are taken over. If, for example, another creditor or another address was selected in these document settings, the field is overwritten. If a cover letter or footer text is taken over via the document settings, the old text module is replaced. Input window: This window is used to maintain orders. You can select an order by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". The order texts for the document footer can optionally be entered as text or as a Word document and combined with text modules. The window is closed without saving changes. If you want to save the changes, you must press the \"OK\" button. If this option is set, the cost price of the order item is taken over as the order price and thus overwrites the supplier's standard order price.: Option window Adopts the default settings as they were at initialisation, before they may have been changed by the editor.

For example, a holder plate that is stamped from a large raw material sheet.This sheet metal plate is not stocked because the remaining surface dimensions in the warehouse cannot be accurately calculated by punching out certain shapes. The remaining quantity of sheet metal plates is estimated for each requirement and either reordered via the order proposal list or simply rejected.

Only from the overall context across all orders is it reliably possible to make an estimate as to whether a raw material is better ordered or still sufficiently available. Therefore, the list is created without restrictive search fields. It must always be kept clean.Regardless of whether rejected or ordered, the parts request item is then posted to the status \"Provisioned: Stock\" is posted.

The approved requisitions are automatically distributed to the individual purchasing staff members, since each purchase order item has been assigned to a purchasing area (\"Purchasing area\" field in the purchase order item window) and the purchasing areas have been assigned to the purchasing staff members(structure PURCHASING_GROUPS \"Purchasing areas\"). Functionality: The user automatically sees the requirements of his purchasing areas to be ordered, but can also access the purchasing folders of other clerks. The documents that are displayed are located in the activity folder of the corresponding user in the subfolder \"Requirement request item\" / \"Requirement request item approved\". Select the responsible agent. All approved purchase requisitions open. To trigger the purchase order, you must select the item that is to be ordered. Via 'Enter new purchase order' or via 'Edit - Purchase order - Enter new purchase order' the system automatically assigns a consecutive order number and you reach the window 'Purchase order item .', which consists of the requirement item. You can now revise this item, e.g. insert prices or change the order text etc. With 'OK' you save the item and with 'Close' you reach the window 'Order.'. The approved requisition window has the following functions: The functions are always executed on all selected list items. If you want to create a new purchase order, for example, you must first select the requirement items and then either press the button Press or call up the menu item \"Edit -> Purchase order -> Enter new purchase order\". Before entering a new or extending an existing (open) order, appropriate security questions are asked. Purity: Purity means the following and is explained here using the example of supplier purity: Parts A, B and C are marked in the list of approved requisitions. Part A and B have the same main supplier, part C has a different one. First of all, an order for part A is created, which is extended by that for part B. Now the system notices that part C has a different main supplier and opens a new order. The same is true when extending orders, which can be opened in the background behind the list of approved requirement requests. It is checked whether the supplier on the purchase orders open in the background is the same as the main supplier of the part to be extended. Each project can contain various other purities (requester, project, delivery address.) This purity can be switched off via the menu: Edit->Orders->Expand order (forced/no purity). In the module, all other requisition items can actually also be displayed (which are posted in other subfolders of the \"requisition item\" folders). Via the menu item \"Status selection\", another status (default always \"Approved\") can be selected for this, e.g. \"Partially ordered\". The latter status is also very important, as the only partially ordered requisitions still appear in the respective MRP accounts, but no longer in the list of (only) approved requisitions. In such a view, the list can be filtered with the right mouse button or via the menu item Edit-> Display filter, if possible, as follows: The window title shows which status (in round brackets) and which filter (in square brackets) is currently selected (e.g. \"Requirement request items (approved) [[all]\").

Thus, the masks for the entry look almost identical, but are still two different ones. However, the masks can be distinguished by the title and by the picture next to the number. The differences to the invoices: The first difference is, of course, that the values, even if they are shown as positive, are recorded negatively in the financial accounts. In the same way as for incoming invoices, \"normal\" and \"free\" items can also be entered for credit notes. The difference, however, is the previous check. Thus, normal items of a credit note can only be entered if the previous order item has the status \"partially invoiced\" or \"invoiced\". These \"normal\" items should be recorded if the credit note is intended to cancel all or part of the invoice or quantity invoiced. If the full invoice quantity is credited, the order item is again in the status \"not invoiced\". The other case is that a rebate/discount is subsequently credited to the invoiced quantity. In this case a credit note is recorded, but this should not have any effect on the calculation status of the order item. This corresponds to the free item, as is already the case with incoming invoices. The following aspects have an influence on the release of a position.

This results in further subtasks such as checking the invoice, making the initial account assignment and posting in the financial accounting. ClassiX® supports this process by an ergonomic, semi-automatic capture of the incoming invoice. By means of an automated check, which presents the invoices to be checked directly to the respective employees for checking, the time delay caused by transport and communication between the departments/employees involved is minimised. Due to the assignment of the incoming invoice via the document history to the demand triggers, the initial account assignment is also carried out automatically. the posting to the financial accounting is carried out via the invoice receipt book. General overview of the workflow of incoming invoices: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"422\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}. General procedure for processing incoming invoices: 1. invoice receipt / options Entering an incoming invoice begins outside the ClassiX® system by assigning a paging number. The stack of invoices to be entered should now be sorted by this number. This way, the \"Date of receipt\" and the \"Auto. Pagination number\", which are set automatically when each invoice is entered. The pagination number is incremented after each invoice and is then updated when the next invoice is entered. Thus the invoice stack should be sorted according to the LiFo principle (last in first out), i.e. the invoice with the smallest pagination number is always on top. 2. create a new incoming invoice The creation of a new incoming invoice in ClassiX starts with pressing the button NEW and entering the header data. The focus is now in the field Invoice number and jumps by RETURN to the field Invoice date. 3. creating the incoming invoice items Again via RETURN you can now access the order field. By entering and triggering the purchase order number to which the incoming invoice refers, the incoming invoice is created, the pagination number and the date of receipt are transferred according to the options and the vendor according to the purchase order. However, the most important part of this step is the creation of incoming invoice items according to the purchase order. Subsequently, further orders can be triggered if the supplier has invoiced several orders at the same time. 4. input of the invoice amounts For the sake of efficiency, the invoice amounts are recorded in a separate window. For the invoice header, these would be the service charges, the tax value and the invoice value. The net value is then calculated from the difference. In addition, service charges can also be recorded at the order level. This is particularly relevant if several orders from the supplier have been combined in one invoice. The input tax is attempted to be determined automatically on the basis of the supplier and is offered as a pre-selection. If the tax is overwritten, it is not only copied into the header, but also to all newly created items. In addition, the order conditions are displayed and can be exchanged here if the creditor has referred to other conditions. If freight and packaging are taken over as additional costs via the order, a note appears in the quick comparison window so that these costs are not entered twice. The order header conditions are also transferred to the incoming invoice. Only if all conditions of the purchase orders also appear in the incoming invoice, the ER can be released automatically. The additional costs reappear in the incoming invoice as conditions, whereby the additional costs of the order item level are distributed by value to the items just created automatically. When deleting items, the ancillary costs are then distributed again. As a result, you can no longer maintain the distributed conditions via the item mask, but only the originally created item ancillary costs. There is an extra window for this, which you open via the menu Edit -> Conditions -> Edit additional costs. Two columns are displayed. On the one hand the value of the service charge item, which can be maintained via OboxEdit, and on the other hand the items to which the service charge item refers. The distributed value is shown in brackets after each item. 5. capture \"free positions A free incoming invoice item is used to record those incoming invoices which cannot be recorded in the regular way. A free incoming invoice item must always be entered manually. Another special feature is that it never goes directly to the \"released\" status, but must always be checked beforehand. Furthermore, it has no influence on an order status, as the items are entered without quantity. Free items can only be entered if the invoice has already been created. Therefore you should save at least once and already have the vendor, paging number, etc. A free position can now be created via the \"Insert\" button and the \"Free position\" menu that opens. In case the invoice cannot be assigned to a ClassiX® order at all, all data of the item must be set manually. Otherwise, for example an order header can be selected as predecessor. In this case, among other things, the vendor is transferred to the invoice header, if this has not yet been done at this point. If the data is not sufficient for the examiner, the description field can also be used. The field \"invoice quantity\" remains permanently closed for this type of entry. Thus the invoice item has no influence on the invoice status of the order. 6. release cycle The next step is to advance (\"release\") the incoming invoice. If no item is displayed in the item list with a stop sign, which stands for a manual check, the invoice goes directly to the status \"released\" by advancing and can thus be transferred to the financial accounting. Otherwise, all items that could not be automatically released are presented to the inspectors for checking. (see test reasons) In addition, a rule (recognition rule) can be stored in the client, which automatically accepts an invoice. The rule could for example be: \"The net value of the invoice is less than 100€\". If an invoice has been entered to which the rule applies, a checkbox \"Accept invoice\" opens next to the \"Release\" button, which is clicked by default. A set checkbox means that the invoice will still be checked, but not in the manual check. Instead, the invoice is released directly. The rule mentioned as an example thus leads to the fact that all invoices under 100€ can be directly released and thus paid, although there are reasons for checking (e.g.: open goods receipt). If you would like to have an invoice checked despite the rule, the tick must be removed from the checkbox. Incoming invoices that are directly recognised do not have to be approved, even if the licensing regulations provide for this. 6.1 Checking a position If there are reasons (see reasons for checking) which prohibit the automatic release of an incoming invoice item, this invoice is presented to the auditors for manual release. In addition, the person entering the incoming invoice can also mark an item as \"to be checked\", although no defined reasons for checking apply. Items with the status \"Check\" are usually released by the inspector (field in the item mask). He finds his incoming invoices to be checked in his activity folder. All fields are blocked for the verifier, as he should only have the possibility to block or release the incoming invoice. If he blocks an item, the entire incoming invoice is also blocked. Otherwise it is checked whether all items have been released. If this is the case, the incoming invoice is also released for posting. The auditor shall be provided with his own tool for checking the incoming invoices to be audited. (see here). VAT invoice: As a rule, the tax key is stored both in the incoming invoice header and in the items, whereby only one tax key may be used in the whole invoice. This is different for overtax invoices. Here, the incoming invoice header is not assigned a tax key at all, which means that different taxes can be entered in the items. Account assignment: Topic on the subject of \"accounting/pre-assignment Four values are required for the account assignment of an incoming invoice, which are set in the ER items. An absolute must is the financial accounting account and the amount. The financial accounting account can be either a G/L account or a cost element, if the cost element account assignment is permitted by the settings in the client. The other values are the cost centre and the cost unit. The financial accounting account is usually specified directly in the order item role and is set automatically when the item is entered. An exception are text articles, for example, where a \"default\" cost element is stored in the client. The same also applies to the account assignment of service charges. Important notes: The automatic account assignment can be changed manually in the invoice receipt book. Once this has been done, the invoice can no longer be changed via the editing screen. With the cost unit account assignment, an attempt is made to determine the exact share of the cost unit items in an incoming invoice. If one or more cost object predecessors have no quantities because it is the order header or a group, the remaining quantity (BA quantity - sum of the cost object quantities) is divided proportionally among the remaining items without quantities. If an overdelivery/underdelivery (BA quantity > or < sum of cost object quantities and there are no items without quantities) takes place, the total costs are divided on the basis of the number of predecessors, since it is not possible to assign the over quantity exactly to a cost object item. The value of the delivery schedule(s) is decisive for the cost allocation of a free item. If a free item has one or more purchase orders as predecessors, all delivery schedules of these purchase orders are taken into account. When releasing or forwarding incoming invoices, the account assignment is checked for the presence of a cost object or cost centre if the cost type insists on a cost object or cost centre constraint. Account assignment of an (EU) income tax A purchase tax of, for example, 16% is treated as 0% in the incoming invoices and only affects the account assignment. The created posting container for the tax has the value zero externally (display in the invoice receipt book etc.), but internally in the financial accounting the 16% value is used for calculation. Manual account assignment of an (EU) income tax. Determining the invoice quantity: The invoice quantity is attempted to be determined automatically in order to save time during data entry. The following quantities serve as a basis for the determination: - Order quantity - Delivery quantities - QA quantities (for QA parts) - invoiced quantity (quantity already invoiced by the supplier) The invoice quantity is determined according to the following logic. No QS parts: QA parts: Attention! It can only be attempted to determine the quantity invoiced by the supplier, there is of course no 100% certainty. Therefore, the invoiced quantity should be checked manually to avoid errors. Recording of a penalty (contractual penalty): The penalty is a contractual penalty or also a contractual penalty for non-performance or poor performance of deliveries and services and is designed as a fine. The recording of a penalty differs from other invoices in purchasing in that the penalty is to be regarded as income and not as expense. Thus, when assigning an account, a revenue account instead of an expense account and a VAT account instead of an input tax account must be addressed. The selection of the revenue account on the item does not differ from normal incoming invoices. However, the selection of a VAT key must first be enabled via the options. The penalty should be recorded as a credit note with positive values and a value added tax. The posting record for a contractual penalty of 100€ then looks like the following: For the entry of the penalty, it is advisable to have a free position which is assigned to the order header as a predecessor. Incoming invoice capture via scanned documents: When entering incoming invoices using scanned documents, it is assumed that the invoices are already available in a scanned form in a register. The scanned incoming invoices and incoming credit notes must be stored in separate directories. These directories are defined in the client. In addition, two directories must be defined in which the scanned documents are moved and archived. The directories shall be defined according to the following scheme: Path for scanned incoming invoices : Z :\\classix\\IncomingInvoices\\*.pdf Path for incoming invoices to be processed: Z:\\classix\\InvoicesReceived\\InProcess\\. Path for incoming invoices to be archived: Z:\\classix\\IncomingInvoices\\Archive\\ It is important that the path to the scanned incoming invoices also includes the type of document (pdf, tif, etc.), as other files, such as text files with the contents read from the documents, can also be stored here. To prevent the folder of archived incoming invoices from becoming too full and thus confusing, there is the option \"Move archived scanned documents to subfolders (year-month)\". With this option, further subfolders with the designation \"yyyy-mm\" are created below the folder. Thus the folder \"2013-01\" stands for January 2013. The incoming invoices are moved to the archived folder if they have been booked or rejected in the financial accounting. For invoices that have been booked into the financial accounting, the posting date of the financial accounting successor is decisive for the creation and moving into a subfolder. For rejected incoming invoices, it is the invoice date. The file name must correspond to the pagination number of the invoice/credit note. The file name can additionally begin with \"ER\" or \"EG\" to determine the type of document via the name. However, the documents are distinguished by the different directory and not by this abbreviation. When determining the pagination number, any existing abbreviation is omitted. Automatic creation of incoming invoices: When opening the editing mask, a check is made to ensure that scanned documents to be imported are in the appropriate directory. If this is the case, this is indicated in the toolbar by a \"GO\" character ( ) and the number of documents to be imported is displayed, otherwise a \"STOP\" sign ( ) are shown. The import is started by pressing the \"Go\" sign. Then the file with the smallest pagination number is searched for in the directory of the invoices to be imported. If no pagination number with a valid format could be found or if the pagination number was already used, the process is cancelled. The next step is to move the file to the archive directory. If there is a file with the same name and the extension \".txt\" in the directory, this file is also moved into the archive directory. Next, a new invoice is created with the determined pagination number and the file moved to the archive directory is associated with it. This is done by means of local document references. The document is also opened automatically so that the invoice data can be determined and transferred to the incoming invoice mask. The document associated with the invoice can be edited at any time using the toolbar button for editing associations ( ) can be opened. If the scanned content of the incoming invoice document was placed in a text file of the same name, this file is searched for data which can be automatically transferred to the invoice mask. This is, for example, the supplier, which can be determined via the sales tax ID. Manual creation of incoming invoices: It is also possible to enter the incoming invoice manually, for example if the incoming invoice document is available in analogue form. In this case, the incoming invoice is entered into ClassiX with the pagination number. ClassiX then automatically checks whether there is a document with the same name in the folder for the scanned incoming invoices. If this is the case, the local document reference is created and linked to the incoming invoice. The document is moved to the \"in process\" folder. The PDF does not open automatically in this case, as in this case the entry is not made via the PDF. In the case of manual creation of the incoming invoice/credit note, it is not necessary to store the scanned documents in different folders for invoices and credit notes, as the distinction between invoice and credit note is made manually via the capture. General information: Only after each of the A/P invoice items has been released can the entire A/P invoice be posted. Access to the incoming invoice modules is prohibited if the purchase orders and the account assignment monitors belong to different clients (domains). List window: Used to list the incoming invoices. Selection window: This window is for selecting an A/P invoice. Implementation: checkMask CalculatePurchaseInvoice Controls the entire calculation of the incoming invoice CalculateSubPositions MarkAllBookingContainers DetailedAccounting CalculateSubPositions Adds all net and gross values (Pos. Totals) of the incoming invoice items. These values serve as the calculation basis (Pos. Totals + Conditions(CalculateSingleCharge)) of the calculated incoming invoice value. MarkAllBookingContainers Initialises the values of the accounting containers. DetailedAccounting CalculateFirstDifferences AccountingRecursive CalculateFirstDifferences_Tax AccountingRecursive_Tax CalculateFirstDifferences Calculates and distributes the cost of the input invoice/item. The result is the vector accounted.amount, which is divided as follows: CX_PURCHASE_INVOICE CX_LINK_TXN GetBaseAccountingValue InitAccountedAmount AccountingRecursive If an incoming invoice is passed to the macro, all items are calculated by calling the macro CalculateFirstDifferences. Subsequently, surcharges and the net difference are distributed to the items before the macro is called up recursively. The accounting containers are then created for the items by calling up the macro AccountTmpPos. CalculateFirstDifferences GetBaseAccountingValue Determines the net value of the incoming invoice (sum of the items)/item (quantity * price). InitAccountedAmount Initialises the vectors which are hidden behind accounted.amount (see CalculateFirstDifferences). The first vector is assigned the return value of the macro GetBaseAccountingValue , all others the value \"0\". CalculateFirstDifferences_Tax If an incoming invoice item is passed to the macro, this will calculate the tax value (gross-net). The 0th element of the taxed.amount vector is then initialised with this value. The 1st element receives the value \"0\". Otherwise, if an input invoice object is passed, the taxed value is calculated based on the sums of the net and gross values. The vector is then pre-initialised in the same way. The difference between the calculated and the actual tax value is then written into the second element. AccountingRecursive_Tax CalculateFirstDifferences_Tax CalculateSingleCharge Calculates the net value including the conditions. Quality assurance: Messages during account assignment.

        "output": "Incoming invoice status: The list window of incoming invoice items serves as an important tool for the auditors of incoming invoices and credit notes in their work. In addition, it can be used as a statistic. Audit of incoming invoice items: If an inspector uses the tool provided by ClassiX®, alternatively he could also look into his processes, he should select in the status list the statuses to which items not yet released are assigned. These are the statuses \"in inspection\", \"item with open GR\" and \"item with open QA\". Afterwards, one can use the search fields to search for the desired items from the selected states. An inspector would thus select himself as an inspector to display all items he still has to inspect. Now that the positions are displayed in the list, the columns with the stop sign and the green check marks or red crosses are of great importance for the test. A stop sign signals to the inspector \"Attention, the position could not be released automatically at the time of advancing\", so it must now be released by the inspector. (If one selects a position and presses the smart button (yellow lamp), the user receives a short description of the position and the reasons for the check). The next three columns show the auditor whether the audit reasons still apply at the time of list construction. Thus, an item that has three green ticks can be released directly. The inspector can do this directly from the status window by selecting the items and choosing \"Release\" from the context menu. If a position has a cross in the second and third column, it is assumed that the crosses will still be replaced by a tick when the position has been delivered or checked. Thus, the inspector should not yet release the item directly, but rather wait and see. If there is a cross in the first column (all other reasons, such as value deviation), the inspector can assume that the reasons for the inspection remain the same and therefore cannot avoid becoming active and inspecting the position. Single search / multiple search: From the main menu, you can choose between single and multiple search, with multiple search as the default. With the single search, the states to be searched can be limited in the state window and then you can search for documents within these states using exactly one filter. If you search via one field, all other fields are cleared. By pressing the start button (sum symbol in the toolbar) no field is searched but all positions of the selected states are displayed. In the multiple search, all filled search fields marked in blue are & Linked. In this way, for example, all items to be checked for an employee in a certain period can be displayed. In input fields, the search can be started via Return. If an employee or the purchasing area is selected in the combo boxes, the search does not start immediately in order to be able to set further restrictions.

General: A part to be ordered and corresponding order data and conditions are recorded on an order item. An order item basically consists of one or more delivery schedule lines; details such as quantity, date and others are only given on individual delivery schedule lines. If a provision is required for the order item, a note is displayed next to the order type: ATTENTION: PROVISION. Next to this note a button \"Beistellungen\" appears, which opens the attached provisions. Framework order (blanket order): An order item can be configured for subsequent call-off (blanket order):. Order text field, note for supplier or recipient.: The order text field is blocked for blanket orders. This is because the system checks during extension whether the description of the blanket order and that of the part or requirement request to be inserted are the same. If this is not the case, the blanket order is not extended, because otherwise the description from the requisition would not be adopted. If you want to tell the supplier or the recipient something, there are the fields Note for supplier and Note for recipient, the view can be switched by clicking the corresponding button. These fields should be used especially if the actual order text of a part from the parts master, i.e. not e.g. a text article, is not sufficient or has to be supplemented for a special reason! If the actual order text is never sufficient or always has to be supplemented by the same addition, then this should be corrected in the master data or the supplier agreement. If you now have an open blanket order in the system and want to change the order text in the order item, you will receive a warning message in the order item which explains this difference and asks whether the now changed order text in the order item should be adopted in the blanket order!. Subsequently combine an open requirement request item with an open delivery schedule line: If a requirement request item and a delivery schedule line from a purchase order item are created individually in the system, whereby they both belong to one business transaction, then such two items can be linked in a document chain: the requirement request item is to be dragged and dropped onto the delivery schedule line. Requirements: - exactly one requirement request item may be included - the delivery schedule must not have a preceding document - the requisition item should be open (not yet completely ordered) - Parts on the requisition item and the order item should be the same. Subsequent connection order item -> delivery schedule (requester: customer requirement)-: There are four possible connection types between order items and delivery schedules:. Determination of prices: The procedure for price determination for order items is as follows. The price found first is drawn into the order: (Macro GetItemSupplier in purcoedt.mod fetches suppliers, puroiedt fetches a price matching the supplier) 1. price agreements of the purchase contract selected in the order header 2. supply agreements of the A-supplier 3. last price of the part with the last supplier 4. first found delivery agreement of the ordered article 5. price from order article roll (standard price) 6. price from requirement request item If price 0 is drawn by one of these steps, the price is taken from the requirement request item or the previous order. The last price used is stored in the selected supplier's movement monitors. All discounts and surcharges are taken into account. The prices from the orders are processed in the following areas: 1. goods receipt 2. average price calculation 3. stock statistics (determination of the stock value) The goods receipt passes on the price received from the order to the other departments. Redetermination of the price If the order item consists of only one delivery schedule line, the price is determined anew each time it is saved and checked to see whether it has changed (e.g. manual entry). However, if the order consists of several delivery schedule lines, the price will only be redetermined after saving the processed delivery schedule line. This happens because the price often only changes when the number of items in the delivery schedule line is changed. If the attribute values are changed, the price is calculated anew each time. Calculation of price conditions on order items and delivery schedules: There are two ways to provide order items with conditions. 1- You save the conditions directly in the order item. Then, after determining the delivery schedule line prices, the condition is offset against the result. 2- you save the conditions in the delivery schedule itself. In this way, valid conditions can be saved for each delivery schedule line, which have no influence on other delivery schedule lines. The result of the following conversions is stored in the slot gross.value. This is then used for further processing in the goods receipts and average value calculation. Absolute conditions: It should also be noted that absolute conditions (-100€) also affect the unit price. It is therefore multiplied, like all other conditions in the items, by the quantity stored for the item. Determination of the prices of the individual delivery schedules with absolute surcharges/discounts (e.g. in order status list and calculation of the values in average value calculation and stock value calculation) Data that were defined in delivery schedules are shown in yellow. Data that were defined in order items are shown in blue. Data that were defined in the order header are shown in green. Conditions that originate from higher-level data records and have been split are shown in italics. Definitions of the slots: total.value: In total.value the values from the current position including conditions and all their big.value: This price is the basis for all subsequent calculations and display forms in which the The allocation of conditions from the purchase order items to the delivery schedule lines is carried out proportionally by the quantities specified in the delivery schedule lines to the total quantity of the purchase order item. Further examples are listedin this Excel file. Conditions from the order header are divided up proportionally based on the price volume of the order items. The intermediate price marked in grey is used to determine these prices. These proportions are then divided up among the delivery schedule lines in the same way as conditions on order items. Explanation of the calculation of the order header condition to be split using the above example: Total surcharge on order header: 1000€ 1st order item: 1000€/14.160€*4.160€ = 293,79€ (surcharge/total volume of order*total volume of order item) 1. delivery schedule of the first order item: 293,79€/40*10 = 73,45€ (surcharge/total quantity order item*quantity to 2. delivery schedule of the first order item: 293,79€/40*30 = 220,34€ (surcharge/total quantity order item*quantity to 2nd order item: 1000€/14.160€*10.000€ = 706,21€ 1. delivery schedule of the second order item: 706,21€/10.000*10.000=706,21 Total volume of the surcharge: 706,21€ + 73,45€ + 220,34€ = 1000,00€ Determining the total price of the order (in the order item window):. Adopt order item price as a supplier-specific price: With the toolbar button the price from the order item is stored as a supplier-specific price on the order item (only if a supplier is on the order and a parts order reel is available). If the order item has imputed conditions (discount, surcharge, freight etc.), the question is asked whether the price should be adopted with such conditions or without. If a vendor-specific price for the order item already exists and is \"complex\" (i.e. the price is a complex price with more than one pricing element or is defined as a conditional table or function), then such a price cannot be overwritten. Input window: This window is used to maintain order items. Via 'Part' you select the corresponding part from the order item list that opens. You can then insert the supplier's order number and revise the order text as required. In the field 'Delivery schedule' via 'Insert' you can enter the order quantity and your desired date. It is also possible to divide the order quantities and specify your desired date for the individual quantities, e.g. 10 pieces as quickly as possible, rest on call. In the fields 'Comment' and 'Recipient' you can add comments to your order In the lower part of the mask you can now enter the price of your order items and any discounts to be granted. With 'OK' you save the order item. The system assigns an item number and copies the item into the order. Quick order window: This window is used to quickly enter order items that do not have a predecessor, i.e. for cost centre orders. In comparison to normal order processing, only the essential order information is therefore recorded. This enables a fast entry of orders, e.g. in case of a JIT parts request for a production order by the production itself. Furthermore, JIT order faxes can be used for the creation of JIT order faxes. However, it is still possible to process the order via the normal order processing at any time. During the fast entry of a new order, the logged in employee is suggested as the processor of the order. First of all, a supplier should now be selected who is to receive the order. The supplier address and the fax number are then transferred. A later redefinition of the supplier is only possible via the normal order mask. Position data: This window is used to maintain the order item data. Grouped positions: It is possible to check via the order status list or the order header using a toolbar button (Check price summary) whether different order items of the same variant parts with different characteristics can be combined and thus a quantity discount can be deducted from the price tables. This is possible if the attributes required for the price tables of the order prices are the same for all of these variant parts which are actually differently marked. The corrected prices can then be applied to the order items after viewing them in a results window. Extend order process 2 - AppendPurchaseOrderItems: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"424\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Interface description: CX_PURCHASE_ORDER (Vector, Collection, Object CX_CONTAINER) SendMsg(APPEND_PURCHASE_ORDER_ITEMS) In the Vector there are edited data in the order header editing module. The message APPEND_PURCHASE_ORDER_ITEMS must not be called individually. If an order is to be extended by items, it is necessary to call up the message APPEND_PURCHASE_ORDER. AppendPurchaseOrderItems: The transferred order is held in the variable purchaseOrder. Then all further objects are passed through: First of all, all information of the object to be created that is available up to this point is plugged (macro PlugWithPredecessor) and an attempt is made to resolve any existing variant part. The (un)resolved part is kept in the variable orderItem, which is used for further work. Now an order item is searched for in the transferred order that has the same part (macro FindPurchaseOrderItem). If such an item is found, this order item is called with EditObject, otherwise a new one is created. A new delivery schedule is later created on this order item. For this purpose, the quantity to be ordered must first be determined. In some containers passed to the AppendPurchaseOrderItems macro, a quantity is already present. However, this quantity is now converted by the macro GetAmountToOrder using the lot sizes. If there was no quantity in the container, the standard quantity is taken from the order item roll. But first of all it is checked again whether the order item found is a blanket order (macro CheckCallForwardTransaction). If not, all relevant data from the preceding document is transferred to the new order item and this is created/saved by SaveObject. If an order item with the same part has already been found, this information is not overwritten. A SaveObject is now not necessary. The macro CreateSubItem, to which the preceding document and the quantity to be ordered is transferred, now creates a delivery schedule line with the correct quantity and at the same time correctly reposts the preceding document. Here the predecessor is also linked to the new transaction. GetBasePurchasePrice: Once the delivery schedule has been created, you can search for the price that matches the supplier you may have entered. A TRUE or a FALSE is passed to this macro, which controls in the macro where the required information, which must be plugged, is taken from. The FindPurchasePrice macro is then used to retrieve the supply agreement between supplier and part and to transfer it to the GetPriceOfLogCube macro. If the macro GetPriceOfLogCube returns no price or an empty price, the standard price is taken from the order item role and kept in the variable tmpPriceDiscount by the macro AppendToTmpPriceDiscount. GetPriceOfLogCube: This macro determines the price from the transferred LogCube. If there is no price or if it is zero, the system searches for the price of the last movement monitor of this supplier and returns it if found. AppendToTmpPriceDiscount: This macro builds a valid price chain (CX_PRICE_DISCOUNT with subCharges) on the basis of one or more objects transferred in succession. Here all main chain links are retained, but their individual subCharges are resolved by a call to Amount(). If these would also be taken over, the final result would be wrong, because the sub-discounts on a main chain link already refer to the discount and not to the main price. If, for example, a chain link looks like this: +150€-10% then the -10% refers to the extra 150€ which in the end equals +135€. For further explanations of the price chains, see here. SaveConditions: The previously created price chain tmpPriceDiscount is divided into conditions. For each price chain link, a condition is created for the order item object. Module name: puroitem.mod.

If requirements are ordered, the requirement request item is replaced by another MRP receipt document: Order item (e.g. in the Approved Requirement Request module). Attention- Transfer of attributes from order item: If a requirement request for an order part with in-house supplies is created either directly from an order or as level 0 in the part request, all order item attributes are transferred to the requirement request. Usually only those attributes are taken over which are available in the attribute bar of the variant part. Position types: see order position. Subsequently combine an open requirement request item with an open delivery schedule line: S. Order item. Cancellation: A requisition item can be cancelled (for example, if the item has already been ordered but the order was subsequently cancelled). A cancelled requirement request item is not considered in most modules: it is not posted to the MRP account, the parts to be ordered are considered as not yet requested, etc. In info modules, however, such items are displayed (e.g. document history). Transfer of data from the requirement request into a purchase order: The prices of the requisition item are not copied into the purchase orders, except that no price could be redetermined, controlled by characteristics from the order/item and the selection of the supplier, or the price is 0. For more detailed pricing in orders see here. The note for the recipient is also included in the order. The note, however, is not. The note for the recipient appears in the field of the same name in the delivery schedule. In the list of delivery schedule lines on the order item, this text is displayed under the heading Remarks.

With the point 'Edit -Type' you can decide afterwards which type the position should be displayed. Via the item 'Edit - Select part' you can call up the different search masks via the points specified there. Via 'Purchasing part', for example, the search mask for order items opens, from which you can now select the relevant item by double-clicking. The 'Requirement request item' window adapts to any selection. If you have decided on one of the possibilities, e.g. for a sales order, you can take over items from an order directly via 'Insert'. The 'Order item' window then opens, in which you call up the corresponding order, select the item to be ordered and confirm with 'OK'. The order quantity must be specified in the 'Part' section. Clicking on 'Part' opens the search mask for the parts master, from which you can now select the relevant part by double-clicking. If a provision is necessary for the requirement request, a note is displayed next to the order type: ATTENTION: PROVISION. Next to this hint a button \"Beistellungen\" appears, which opens the attached provisions. In the field 'Supplier' you can select a supplier from the supplier master. You can then enter the price, the supplier's order number, any discount to be granted, the desired delivery date and any comments on the order under 'Note'.

If the information of the assigned persons/companies in the sanctions lists changes due to the import/update, entries from the whitelist or blacklist are automatically transferred to the checklist to be checked. Entries in the checklist must then be checked again. Sanctions lists monitor: When this app is called up, it automatically checks whether the date of the last match run is earlier than the date of the last update of the sanctions lists. Therefore, if newer sanction lists are available, one is prompted to perform a match run immediately. In the first tab Matches, the processing of the matches of the own business partners takes place. This list should be viewed after each match and - if new matches have been found - these should be moved to either the blacklist or the whitelist. In the blacklist, the business partners are transferred by them as actually sanctioned and thus declared as \"blocked\" for their business. The Whitelist tab contains the business partners that they have checked and are classified by them as not suspicious. In the Checklist are the business partners whose assigned persons/companies of the Pythia database have been changed during a subsequent re-import of data, necessitating a re-check of the originally blacklisted or whitelisted partners. Hit: This window is divided into two parts: after a comparison, the upper list shows the own business partners (persons or companies) who became conspicuous during a comparison because a certain match with sanctioned persons or companies from the Pythia database became apparent. In addition to the name and address of their business partner, the number of matches with sanctioned persons/organisations/companies in the Pythia database is output. The last column output is the smallest error from these matches, where an error of zero means a \"clear match\" and an error of one means \"no match\". (An error of one is not output in the lists). If a row is selected in the upper list, the sanctioned persons and/or companies from the Pythia database that have some match to the matched person/company/one-time address of their own host database or in their Outlook contacts are displayed in the lower list. Lists List Description Matches found on persons/companies/once addresses List of possible matches to the checked persons/companies/once addresses in the host database or Outlook contacts. If an entry is selected in this list, the persons/companies from the Pythia database that may match this partner are displayed in the lower list. Once this list has been logged, its entries can be moved to the blacklist or whitelist using the context menu (right mouse button). Logged (persistent) entries are in the list if, on the one hand, a logging of the result was carried out after a comparison or, on the other hand, if an anti-terror screening log is moved to this list by drag&drop: the hits found for the respective log are then output in this list for further processing. the entry has been added to the whitelist : the entry has been added to the blacklist Sanctioned persons/companies/one-time addresses List of sanctioned persons and companies from the Pythia database that could have a possible connection to the entry selected in the list above. Double-clicking on an entry displays the details of the locked partner stored in the Pythia database. Blacklist: This list shows the partners that they have classified as actually \"to be blocked\". If subsequent updates of the Pythia database reveal that data has changed for the persons/companies from the Pythia database that are assigned to a blacklisted partner, then this entry is automatically moved from the blacklist to the checklist. Whitelist: This list shows the partners who were conspicuous in a comparison but could be classified as unsuspicious in a check of them. If it turns out during subsequent imports that data on the persons/companies from the Pythia database assigned to a whitelisted partner has changed, then this entry is moved from the whitelist to the checklist.

(In the classic evaluation system test framework Excel files are available in the directory .\\Projects\\TestFrameworks\\Data\\). The format of these Excel files is as follows: #Flags #Comment #ExecuteString #CommandString #Variable Test access expressions Flags (capitalisation also permitted) Flags Description rem; comments a line from break; leads to the termination of the processing sleep; following lines are not executed until the next \"wakeup;\" flag. This is an easy way to comment out lines in a test framework. wakeup; the following lines are executed again. load; other test frameworks can be included, for example to create parts However, it is not intended to link several evaluations to each other, as no evaluation files are written and no errors are logged when the flag \"load\" is set. goto:line number:condition goto statement: The syntax looks like this: goto:19:var 3 < The first part \"goto\" defines the GoTo statement. Then follows the line number to which the jump is to be made and the last part (e.g. var 3 <, i.e. the value of a previously defined variable var should be less than 3) defines the condition under which the jump label is approached. Only if this condition returns TRUE the GOTO instruction is executed to avoid endless loops. idle(waiting time); The processing of the test framework is paused by the waiting time in ms. The system is idle during this waiting time. This allows the behaviour of the system when waiting for user input to be simulated. Comment: Here you can enter descriptive information about the line. ExecuteString (called column 1 below): The string specified here is placed on the stack as a string. The specifications made here are only used for the purpose of being able to execute the TEST_ or EXEC_ Message in a target module to be executed by Execute. If any TEST_ or EXEC_ is missing message is missing, the entries in this column do not lead to a result. (Note: All AppsWarehouse Apps \"understand\" a TEST_ or EXEC_ message, which only allows the command \"Execute\" to be executed in the respective App). CommandString (named column 2 below): The string specified here is executed directly in the QM App per Execute. Any string specified in column 1 is processed accordingly as a string stack entry. (Examples are listed below) Variable (named column 3 below): With the message QM_ROW_EXECUTED, a stack entry that exists there can be sent back to the QM app using the ExecuteString and its processing in the target module. This stack entry is then saved in the variable specified in this column. Test access expressions: Access expressions can be specified starting from this column. The variables previously defined in the QM App serve as starting points for the access expressions. These access expressions are used to determine the values via the variables, which are then compared with the values stored in the Excel file in the lines. If these values do not match, an error message is displayed. syntax: Access printout Example: purchaseOrder supplier.uniqueID The test file must not contain any blank lines! Therefore, please make sure to always write REM; in the first column(#Flags) of the desired empty lines. Then it will work without the last line not being executed. A few hints for use and examples: Let's assume we want to create a requirement request and use it to create an order. This is how you proceed in the following rough steps: Create empty requirement coverage request Save requirements request via Save button Write part number in requisition item (which opens automatically when the header is saved) and send SELECT message to part number field Change quantity and save position via Save button Book header document Return variable of the requirement request item to our QM App Create order via usual message The following problems need to be solved: How do I send a variable back to the QM App? How do I send my requirement request variable from the QM app to another app via the test message, which only has one execute parameter? and the solutions: SendMsg(QM_ROW_EXECUTED) in column 1, SendMsg(TEST_PURCHASE_REQUISITION_ITEM) in column 2 and the target variable in which we want to hold this position in the QM App, i.e. purchaseRequisitionItem in column 3. The QM app receives this response message and always stores it in the same temporary variable. Then the object is transferred from the temporary variable to the desired variable. The following execution sequence leads to the result, if, for example, the requirement coverage request item is to be drawn into the order as a predecessor: Column 1: Widget(EditWin, predecessors) SendMsg(PURCHASE_REQUISITION_ITEM_SELECTED, DIRECT) Column 2: purchaseRequisitionItem Swap SendMsg(TEST_PURCHASE_ORDER_ITEM) The swap places the variable purchaseRequisitionItem behind the string to be executed, resulting in the following statement: purchaseRequisitionItem \"Widget(EditWin, predecessors) SendMsg(PURCHASE_REQUISITION_ITEM_SELECTED, DIRECT)\" SendMsg(TEST_PURCHASE_REQUISITION_ITEM) When the test message is triggered, there are therefore 2 parameters on the stack: our requisition request position and on the TOP the string to be executed in the target app. At least one blank file and one fully functioning \"example\" test file is checked in at each branch. You can find these test files in the directory: \\AppsWH\\\\\\data\\QS To use the BREAK; and the REM; instruction the following hionweis: This instruction always refers exactly to the beginning of the corresponding line: That means, just as you comment out the line with REM; you terminate with BREAK; also exactly BEFORE executing this line! The line containing the BREAK; is therefore no longer executed. Another tip: Window test messages If a procedure is to be executed via EXEC message, which contains access to widgets written without the leading EditWin, e.g. GetObject(, predecessors), a local test message can be created according to the following scheme: First part: test message (TEST_ORDER), second part window name: (EDIT_WIN) = TEST_ORDER_EDIT_WIN Another test message is defined in the app that receives the test message: Msg(TEST_ORDER_EDIT_WIN) Then ONLY in the action list of the window (here EditWin) this message is intercepted and only supplemented by an Execute: TEST_ORDER_EDIT_WIN: Execute Now you can call procedures directly from the window by Execute without having to add EditWin (the context) in all procedures, which would sometimes even be wrong (if the procedure is called from different windows!). However, the call of the message must then look a little different: Column 1: \"SaveObject\" SendMsg(TEST_ORDER_EDIT_WIN) Column 2: SendMsg(TEST_ORDER) The string to be executed in the window test message must be placed in inverted commas again, otherwise it would already be executed by the first execute (TEST_ORDER). With inverted commas, it is treated as a string and (without inverted commas) loaded onto the stack. Since the SendMsg(TEST_ORDER_EDIT_WIN) statement is not in the stack, this statement is executed and sends the previously loaded string as the next execution command to the window test message. Since not every app needs such a message, and this message should not trigger the app under any circumstances (otherwise there would probably be a lot of duplicate test executions, because customer derivations of these apps might still be created) and there should only be one defined interface to an app, this message should be added according to this scheme if necessary. Common errors that occur when creating a test file: LAZY_CREATOR: If an item of a document is held in a variable in the test file and this variable is used in a column to evaluate a slot or similar, the error message \"Object not yet created\" appears, although this item has already been linked to the header document. As the entire test process is carried out in one main transaction throughout the entire test suite, this LazyCreator is not converted into a persistent object. This must be done in the test file via the OBJECT Manager: position header document GetManager(OBJECT) Call(Instantiate) -> Variable. It is very important that the result of the instantiate is saved back into the variable of the position. Otherwise the old variable pointer still points to the LAZY_CREATOR. Example: orderItem order GetManager(OBJECT) Call(Instantiate) -> orderItem If orderItem is used in a column, this variable must be named differently as long as it still contains the LazyCreator. Because as long as it still points to the LazyCreator, attempts in columns such as orderItem::sales.pricePer will fail with an error message in the QM App. ALSO: Rename variable orderItem to orderItemTmp first and save it to the variable orderItem only after the Instantiate. Then also the column can be evaluated reasonably. Calling several test frameworks Call from the QM App: - Multiple selection of files - Select a folder to run all tests in it Call with a batch file: The exact path of the desired files and folders is stored in variables and assembled into a large string. Extract of a sample file: The spaces in the file names must be replaced with \"***\": SET STRING_1=%CX_QS_PATH%\\Demo\\Test file***Sample name1***-***Demo.xls (Test file Sample name1 - Demo.xls) SET STRING_2=%CX_QS_PATH%\\Demo\\Testdatei***Mustername2***-***Demo.xls SET STRING_3=%CX_OS_PATH%\\Demo\\validity The individual character strings are combined into one and are separated by \"###\": SET CX_ALL_TESTS=%STRING_1click=\"javascript:toggle_dynamic_var(\"###\");\" title=\"Click to edit dynamic variable: ###\">No value assignedSTRING_2Novalue assignedSTRING_3% The call of the file which starts the tests with the variable CX_ALL_TESTS as the transfer parameter: call %CX_ROOTDIR%\\projects\\Start_Testframework.bat %CX_ALL_TESTS% General information: The selected files and folders are assembled into a string and used as transfer parameters for the calling batch file. In this file, the character string is saved as the environment variable \"CX_TESTFRAMEWORKS\". A new CyberEnterprise instance is opened, which reads the character string from the environment variable to call the first test. This test is removed from the string and when it is finished, the batch file is called again, with the new string as the transfer parameter. Thus the test frameworks run one after the other in a separate CyberEnterprise instance. If errors occur, error files are generated, but without the usual request to change to the test directory.

QA required means that they had the QA mark on the part or on one of the requisition, purchase order or goods receipt documents at the specified time. The indicator is frozen during posting so that a subsequent change cannot trigger any errors in further processing. On the delivery schedule of an order for a QA part, the quantity still to be inspected is saved when the goods receipt is posted (inAssurance.quantity). This quantity is reduced by the inspected quantity when a subsequent QA document is posted. The goods receipt document itself therefore takes over the posting of the QA and goods receipt quantities.

        "output": "Database query: This module is used to search for information. On the one hand, this can be done using the search terms categorised by object type, and on the other hand using general and more technical query functions. Advanced search: The \"Advanced Search\" window is always accessed via another module. Usually these are list windows, in which there is a field Search terms. If the simple search using the search terms is not sufficient here, this mask can be called up here as an alternative. The results of the search are always sent back to the calling module, which then takes over the display. Data preparation and filtering: In the widget for data preparation and filtering, various criteria are specified and linked with each other. During execution, these are arranged in such a way that execution is as fast as possible while the meaning of the configured logical expression remains the same. As soon as it can be decided for an object whether it belongs to the result set for sure or not, no further criteria are evaluated for this object. Criteria: At the beginning the widget is still empty and criteria can be added using the green plus. The individual criteria can be removed using the red X on the right-hand side. The order of the criteria can be changed with the arrows on the left side. The individual criteria can be connected by the links AND and OR to form expressions of truth. In addition, the opening and closing brackets can be used for grouping. Unclosed brackets are automatically closed at the end. Categories: Each criterion can be from one of five categories: Query, Attribute, Formula, Callback or InstantView. A criterion of type Query defines a condition for a data field of an object so that it belongs to the result set. The first of the fields defines the access expression to be tested. Instead of the access expression, the name of a column can also be entered. Using the button with the three dots next to the field, either an access expression can be selected via the access expression configurator or one of the defined columns. In the middle the comparison operator is selected and then the value to be compared with is entered on the right. If a method is selected and it cannot be used in a query expression, the criterion is automatically converted into one of the type callback during execution. A criterion of type attribute defines an attribute with a comparison operator and a comparison value. For each object it is checked whether it has the corresponding attribute and whether the value of the attribute matches the relational operator and comparison value. With a criterion of type formula, a formula is defined which is then evaluated for each object. If the formula returns TRUE (or a value that evaluates to TRUE), the object belongs to the result set, otherwise it does not. A criterion of type Callback specifies InstantView® source code that is called for each object. The object is at the top of the stack. The source code should return a value at the end that is TRUE if the object belongs to the result set, otherwise a value that evaluates to FALSE. A criterion of the InstantView type is different from the other criteria in that it is not called for each object individually. Instead, when the specified InstantView® source code is executed, a collection with the previously selected objects is on the stack and at the end a collection with objects on the stack is expected again. The use of this criteria type offers full flexibility in editing options. Naturally, a criterion of this type cannot be moved to another point of processing, so a criterion of the InstantView type interrupts the optimisation. Criteria before and after this criterion are optimised on their own, but it is ensured that all criteria before this criterion are executed before and all criteria after this criterion are executed afterwards. For the same reason no brackets can be defined for this criterion and all previously opened brackets are automatically closed. Parameter: Parameters can be used to determine the criteria dynamically during execution. This is useful, for example, to start reports for the current month. Parameters can be used for criteria of type Query, Callback or InstantView, but not for formulas. The easiest way to use parameters is to use the button with the three dots to the right of the corresponding fields. In the selection you have the possibility to define new parameters or edit existing parameters. The definition of a parameter is replaced by its value during execution. If parameters are to be defined manually, this can be done using the following syntax: ${Name := Initialisation}$ Name stands for the name and is optional (in this case := is also omitted). The name can be given either as a simple string or multilingual as T(\"first language\", \"second language\"). Initialisation contains InstantView® source text that is evaluated during execution and calculates the current value of the parameter. This source text can contain the following constants: If the check box Query parameters is selected for a criterion, a window with the parameters of this criterion and the calculated values is displayed during execution. The names of the parameters are used for this. The values can still be changed in the window. Since valid InstantView® syntax is expected during initialisation, pure text specifications (e.g. as pre-entered values in the parameter query) must be stored in string notation with double inverted commas. Otherwise the text will be wrongly interpreted as a statement and not recognised: ${name := \"given string\"}$ In addition to the initialisation via source code, there is also the possibility to use selection windows for the values of the parameters. The syntax for this is then ${Name := //START_MSG;END_MSG}$ Name is again the name of the parameter. START_MSG defines the message to be sent to open the selection window and END_MSG defines the message to return the result from the selection window. Module name: advancedSearch.app. Classes: -."

        "output": "Exploded (production) parts list: This module is used to process order-specific production parts lists. These are the bills of materials which are generated by the system by exploding master bills of materials, taking into account the characteristics and their values specified from a customer order, warehouse order or advance requirement. The term \"explosion\" refers to the selection of entries from, for example, variant parts list items or the calculation of quantities and/or characteristic values. As a special feature it should be noted that in the so-called tree view of the parts list, the calculated total quantity is displayed for each parts list entry, although only individual quantities are entered. If you change a quantity on any level in the parts list, all quantities on the levels below are automatically updated, i.e. multiplied out and the required total quantities are displayed. Normally, ClassiX® assumes that at least a \"rough\" variant bill of material is defined for each part in the system. This avoids having to define and enter a separate master bill of material for each special case in advance. Within the scope of technical processing and design, this order-specific exploded production bill of materials is then adapted or designed more precisely with regard to parts, characteristic values and quantities. The changes are then only valid for the respective order item. To quickly create new parts lists, it is possible to drag a part from the parts master into the production parts list structure using the mouse. This way only the quantity needs to be adjusted and if necessary the new item needs to be exploded (if it is an assembly - red gear symbol!). In principle, however, it is also possible to completely redefine the order-specific production parts list. Note: If, for example, within an order-specific production bill of materials - which was exploded or generated from a \"standard\" bill of materials - somewhere on a lower structural level, one part is exchanged for another part, then this production bill of materials no longer \"matches\" the original \"standard\" bill of materials. Basically, this is then also a completely new assembly, in general terms, all higher-level parts have been redefined as a result - although they still have their original part number in this production bill of materials. This procedure should therefore only be used in order to be able to quickly and pragmatically comply with any customer request for (simple) \"exotic\" parts (e.g. exchanging the screws for other screw heads). As the production parts lists are retained in the system, it is always possible to trace what has been installed where: However, the order itself must always be queried in the system. It is therefore recommended to make changes to production BOMs only for variant parts (the \"uniqueness\" of the BOM is anyway only ensured by the characteristic values defined in the order) and possibly to mark a characteristic of such parts with a version. Attention: Due to changes in the production bill of materials, it can happen that the routing of the parent part no longer matches the current production bill of materials. In order to be able to find out these items, there is an item\"Display number of entries (production bill of material/master bill of material)\" in the view options in the menu \"Edit\". If this option is set, information is displayed after each line in the production parts list tree: (x/x). The front x represents the number of parts list entries of the exploded production parts list below this entry. The back x represents the number of parts list entries of the master parts list of this entry. In this way, rough changes to the exploded production parts lists compared to the master parts lists can be detected. Special work plan: On each item of the exploded production bill of material, a special routing / one-off routing can be stored which is used for the following production order. In the same way, the total time of all work sequences from this special routing later on in the parts request is the lead time with which the first scheduling is started. So if a production part, which has a master routing over 9 days, is supplemented with a special routing of only one day, only one day is scheduled for this item later in the parts request. This means that the throughput times can be changed in advance using special work plans. Please note: If several BOM items are grouped together for the same part in the parts request, and a special routing has been stored for only one of them, this special routing is used for all BOM items (because of the only parts request item that is created from all identical parts!). One-time work schedule: If a routing is to be defined at the time the production bill of materials is created, a one-off routing can be created at each exploded production bill of materials item. This is a master routing that is only valid for this order and cannot be found later via the normal master search. In order to get an overview of all routings / one-off routings for a production bill of materials, it is possible to display the routings in the tree. A toolbar button with the routing symbol above the tree is provided for this purpose. If a one-off routing is to be extended or even created, it is sufficient to drag the workstation from the resource list to the higher-level bill of materials item with the mouse. If a master special task list was already connected to this bill of material, this connection is released and a one-time task list is created after a query. In this case the one-time task list does not open at all but only its first position with the work centre dragged into the tree. Here it only needs to be filled in and saved and then it also appears in the tree of the production parts list. By double-clicking, one-time task list items can be opened and edited directly. In order to avoid accidentally changing a global master routing, this function is only allowed for one-time routing items. Structural assembly: A component consists of several sub-assemblies to be assembled. In the exploded parts list you can see the subassemblies to be installed under the main part. However, the production department itself would like to save the sub-steps for the assembly and scheduling of subassemblies and assemble them directly only when the main part is assembled. For these cases, the subassemblies are marked in the parts list as constructive assemblies, i.e. the design department sees these parts as subassemblies, but in the production department the subassemblies of the constructive assemblies are all assembled together without the constructive assemblies. The production department sees this parts list as shown in figure 3 The subparts of a constructive assembly located in the exploded production bill of materials are moved up one level in the production order as if the constructive assembly were not even present in the exploded bill of materials and all subparts of the constructive assembly are moved directly to the position where the constructive assembly itself is located. Figure 1: Figure 2: Figure 3: The parts Test4 and Test5 therefore move below the top level, the constructive assembly is not considered further. In this example, all parts are required on manufacturing level 1. Disposable assembly: In the case of the disposable assemblies, one must distinguish between 2 different scenarios: If a bill of material is linked in a production role and an entry exists in the MRP product structure, the specified part is \"pushed\" on the entry of the MRP product structure below the production part when the production bill of material is exploded. All parts which are specified in the bill of material item list on the purely MRP assembly are therefore moved from the higher-level bill of material below the new entry. To create a purely MRP assembly, the system starts from the production role to be inserted in between, creates a purely MRP entry there and selects the bill of material with its items from the higher-level bill of material. This purely dispositive entry is then visible both in the initial production roll and in the production roll of the intermediate part. Attention! A purely disposable assembly is not visible in the normal production parts list display: In the dispositive manufacturing structure, the purely dispositive assembly \"Test3\" appears in the end. For this part a part request item is also created. The parts cx0005 and cx0006 are then arranged below it. An MRP assembly defined by the master is a production part that does not have its own bill of material and contains entries from other, higher-level bills of material in another production part in the \"MRP product structure\" list. (See here for technical pattern) A condition can only be entered for entries in the MRP product structure if the assembly is a purely MRP assembly. Further information on assembly parts lists and on purely disposable assemblies. Change of already processed parts lists: An important point here is that the directly superior production order items must be reprinted after a bill of material item has been added or deleted. For this purpose there is a date on the production order item after the change and on the header, which is supposed to say that the already printed production papers have to be collected and reprinted/distributed. This date can be seen in the production order processing mask and in the worklist in the 2nd column. It disappears again after \"real\" printing of the production documents. Adding parts list items If a parts request for a parts list has already been created and further processed, the corresponding parts list entries can no longer be changed. However, new items can be inserted under production order BOM items if the part request is not released. If the part request has already been released, the release must be cancelled. To insert an item in the parts list, mark the parts list item under which a new item is to be inserted. In the context menu, which can be opened by right-clicking on the selected position, the entry \"Insert\" has to be selected. A security question will appear which must be answered with YES. Now the parts list item can be created and edited in the usual way. All parts that are included in the production bill of materials must be exploded if there is a production bill of materials for the part, even if this item is actually only to be ordered. How the part is to be planned is set later in the part request. If the parts list item is now complete and is to be processed further, the entry \"Edit->Straggler->Extend parts request\" must be selected in the main menu. A new parts requisition item is created for each newly created parts list item (without merging with existing parts list items!!), which is planned immediately, i.e. the new parts requisition item is given its standard planning type (warehouse reservation/purchase requisition/production order) and the procurement time is determined and saved based on this. Now the item only needs to be scheduled and further processed using graphical scheduling from the parts requisition: After the appropriate steps have been taken, the part request must now be released at the end via the menu \"Edit->Further processing->Release part request\". Deletion of parts list items If a parts list item is to be deleted, this can also be done from the parts list. However, the following conditions apply: After checking the conditions, the parts list items are deleted, as are the attached parts request items, provided they are not still needed by other parts list items. exception: If a cancelled successor document is already attached to the part request of the BOM item to be deleted, then both the BOM item and the part request item (if no longer required) are cancelled and displayed with a red X in the BOM. Known change scenarios: Here are instructions on what exactly to do if a change is to be made:. Creation of an advance requirement for a part from a parts list: Via the menu \"Edit>Preliminary requirements>Create preliminary requirements for part from selected item\" a preliminary requirements item for the part can be created for the selected item. All required characteristics from the parts list or the order item are transferred to the advance requirement. Furthermore, the required quantity and the order as predecessor for the advance requirement header are copied. Even if a production part of a bill of material is taken over into a preliminary requirement, which still has subparts that in turn require further characteristics, these are directly taken over into the preliminary requirement item as they were set in the order or the bill of material. If the part for preliminary planning is a production part, the production bill of materials for this item is also copied. This ensures that in the case of processed production parts lists, these changes are also transferred to the advance requirement. Detaching of parts list nodes from the parts list into a preliminary requirement: If the customer requests changes to an order item that has already been processed, it may be necessary to change the main part on the order item. As this would change the exploded bill of material, and production orders have already been created, for example, this change can no longer be carried out. There are now 2 options available: If you open the exploded parts list of the order item, a new menu item \"Edit->Preliminary requirements\" is available. It contains 2 entries: \"Move selected node to advance requirement\" and \"Move all subitems of selected node to advance requirement\". Attention! Constructive assemblies are dissolved! This means that when a constructive assembly is selected and the menu item \"Move selected node to preliminary requirement\" is chosen, not the constructive assembly itself but only its sub-items, which are not constructive assemblies themselves, are moved to a preliminary requirement. Only one preliminary requirements header is created for a bill of material, which then contains all the sub-items created. It is possible to extend an advance requirement that already exists for this order. To do this, the existing advance requirement must be opened before the BOM items are released. The system then checks whether the order header in the opened preliminary requirement is identical to that from the BOM item to be released. If not, a new preliminary requirement is created. Input window: In the tree view, the parts list items can be moved freely in the parts list structure as long as they have not yet been further processed. Exceptions are order and stock parts: Sub-items of them cannot be shifted, as they are only in stock or can be ordered with their original parts list. If a part has already been moved once, the original parent position is saved to it. This means that it can also be extracted from parts lists of ordered and stock parts, for example if they have been moved here by mistake. If a part cannot be moved successfully, the reason is displayed on the status bar of the window. Care window: In this window the entries of a production bill of materials are maintained. In particular, it is possible to exchange the part and/or its bill of material, to make entries for the MRP structure and to make quantity adjustments. On the uppermost bill of material node, a check is carried out to ensure that the bill of material quantity matches the quantity of the predecessor order. Attribute maintenance In addition to the 'normal' options for inserting, creating or removing attributes, further functions are available in the maintenance window of the parts list items. Note: In a production bill of materials, the attributes do not refer to the same attributes at a higher level, as is the case in the order. Therefore, it should be avoided to insert attributes that are already defined in the production BOM or the preceding document. Serial numbers Here the serial numbers are displayed, which were used in the parts list items. Especially the serial numbers which were assigned by the supplier have to be entered here, as these parts do not appear in any production order. The following menu items are used to edit the serial numbers via the parts list:. Selection window: In this window you can search for already exploded production parts lists. List window: With this window exploded production parts lists are displayed in a list form instead of a tree structure. If one selects an entry in the list with a double click, one goes directly back to the selected bill of material item in the tree structure. Right-clicking opens the maintenance window of the selected BOM item. Result check of parts list: This window displays the result if the function \"Check bill of material\" was called up from the editing window of the production bill of material. However, the check is also carried out directly after the production parts list has been created (exploded). The list shows the parts list items for which the check has revealed an error or warning message. The following cases will be examined:. Parts list comparison: With this application it is possible to compare an exploded bill of material with another exploded bill of material. The similarities and differences are displayed in the result list. Example: The customer orders a clockwise rotating system. The order item is released, the production bill of materials is exploded and production is started. After some of the components of the system have already been completed, the customer answers, apologises and now wishes the system to rotate counterclockwise. In this concrete example, the procedure would now be that a new order item is created via the anticlockwise rotating system and its production bill of materials is exploded. The two production parts lists are then compared via the parts list comparison in order to identify the identical and the different components. Call up the parts list comparison: There are two ways to call up the parts list comparison. On the one hand you can call up the menu item \"Edit -> Conversion -> Compare parts list with other parts list\" in an existing production parts list. In the example above you would do this from the parts list of the clockwise rotating plant. The parts list is then taken over as the initial parts list. If you call it up manually, an empty mask opens and the initial parts list must be selected manually via the selection mask of the order items. The next step is to select the target parts list. This is also done via the selection mask of the order items or by drag&drop of the order item. Finally the toolbar button \"Start comparison\" must be pressed to start the comparison. Evaluation of the parts list comparison: The results of the comparison now appear in the results list in the lower part of the window. The first column in this list is the type of result:. Navigation: If a result list entry is double-clicked, the associated parts list items in both trees, if available, are marked. So if you double-click on an entry that starts with \"Found\", the first occurrence of this part is displayed in both parts lists. Via the two parts list trees, the context menu can also be used to navigate to the other parts list and to the results window. See \"Menu\" description below. Toolbar.

        "output": "Calculation of sales costs: In order to find out how much a set of parts would cost the company, or how much a customer order would bring in, without having to create an order or a quotation, there is the sales cost calculation module.Here it is possible to drag and drop sales roles such as sales sets into a list and mark them out. Once the quantity has been defined and set, the objects can be exploded, i.e. the attached parts can be determined in the first step. For each of these, an entry is created in a further list, which contains the part or the exploded subpart.In the next step, depending on the main procurement type (logistics indicator of the part), either the production or the order role is used to create an entry in the next list.Up to this point, all lists can also be supplemented manually by simply adding parts or order/production rolls.In the last step, the parts from the procurement roles in the penultimate list are then used for costing. These are then used to calculate the final value that these parts will cost.The parts of the first list, on the other hand, result in the sales price, or in the final sum the sales value. These final values can be read at the bottom of the list of characteristics.It is possible to drop order items into the sales parts list. All material characteristic settings and the quantity of the order item are transferred to the sales cost calculation item. The order item is linked to the sales cost calculation item as an association if the processing mode is persistent. It can now be found via the document history of the order item. It is also possible to duplicate or copy individual entries by dropping them from the copy buffer or document history. If an item with a sales set is copied in this way, all the lower parts of the set are also copied. Input window: This window is used to maintain sales cost calculations. Position window: Use this window to maintain sales cost calculation items. List window: This window serves to list all persistently saved sales cost calculations. Selection window: This window is used to select sales cost calculations. Option window: All settings for creating sales cost calculations can be made here. Grouped calculation: If an order or a plant consists of many individual items, this window can be used to determine whether there are price advantages on the cost side as a result of combining quantities. If, for example, the order contains three times the same lever that has to be produced, the three order items can be combined to form a production order. This is simulated in this window during the preliminary cost calculation. The individual work steps thus save considerable wage time in makeready. In the case of order parts, it may be possible to purchase a larger lot from the supplier at a lower purchase. In this case, the costs are therefore determined using the total quantity of all items. Sales Costs In connection with sales sets, the sales costs and contribution margin are only displayed correctly if all cost entries have been selected before this window was opened. If the option \"Display totals of selected items only\" is set, incorrect contribution margins can occur with sales set subitems if the sales sets maintain their own prices and do not calculate them from the subitems.

The resulting bill of materials is thus composed of all order items created in the order below the assembly set. The production bill of materials is practically already defined at order item level. In the parts master, the assembly set part has a production role without a bill of materials, but with a routing that contains the assembly only the assembly work of the individual components. Subassembly sets can also be used as purchased parts with own provision. If such a subassembly set is available in the order, one practically determines at the order level through sub-items which goods are to be provided for the order and in which quantities. With the technical release the disposition of the parts to be provided is initiated and the requirement request for the assembly set part is created. Conditional individual parts in sets Conditional individual parts can be included in sets. Characteristics can be assigned to these conditional individual parts, which later appear in the offer or order items. If no characteristics were entered for these conditional individual parts, the quotation or order item automatically takes the characteristics of the selected individual part from the parts master. If conditional items are present in an assembly set, the assembly set in the order is not exploded automatically, but must be exploded using the \"Generate plant components\" button after the attributes on the assembly set order item have been set according to customer specifications (e.g. mains voltage etc.), because this may be the basis for the conditional sub-items of the assembly set. Attention: If, after resolving the conditional assembly set items, the attributes on the assembly set item are changed, the resolved subpart of a conditional item does not change automatically! In this case the subitems must all be deleted and the assembly set must be exploded again! Characteristics of the lower parts When sub-parts are added to sets, all characteristics of the selected part are copied from the part master into the characteristics of the new sub-position of the set.

The article is specified here by defining the attributes when it is used, for example in the order item. However, if standard variants are also sold, they can be assigned their own number without having to create the variant part in sub-parts with their own sales roles. This number is called specification or specification number. If a sales item, which has predefined specifications, is inserted, for example in an order, you can still go via the sales item number and individually define the attributes in the item. However, the specifications also make it possible to search for and insert the item via the specification number in the sales item selection mask. The advantage of this is that the attribute value hidden behind the specification is automatically transferred to the item. The specification number table can be generated automatically from the price table or the table of subparts.

For example, if the combination of the sales articles - the sales set itself - is stocked, it must be assigned to a part (consisting of the combined parts). For example, a spare parts set would be a sales set consisting of different spare parts.

For this purpose, all the items of sales orders are evaluated in which all forms of sales items - within level 0 - have been ordered.Only those order items whose order header is confirmed are included in the statistics. Unconfirmed orders are ignored in the statistics! In addition to sales order items, parts from intercompany orders are also taken into account, but only if parts and not parts roles have been called (see next section).To call up the statistics, you can differentiate between the part selection and the part role selection. With part selection, all the roles of the selected parts specified in the filter for part roles are included in the statistics. If only individual sub-roles of individual parts are selected, only these appear in the statistics.Note! These sales order statistics are intended purely as sales item quantity, value and contribution margin statistics, they are not billing turnover statistics that can be directly matched to the accrual periods in financial accounting . The period accrual in these sales item statistics is based only on the statistics period set on the respective order header. List window: The parts/part roll selection is done via the toolbar button . When you click on it, a sub-menu appears, which offers the selection by parts directly or parts rolls. After selecting the parts, the creation of the statistics starts automatically. The part roll is only displayed in the list if instead of a part its roll(s) has been selected directly via the part roll selection. If parts are selected directly, the values are output over all its roles. If only the time period is changed after the statistics have been created, the new determination can be started for the previously selected parts/part rolls via the toolbar button can be restarted.

        "output": "Release order item technically: With this module, sales order items are technically processed and released. A technical processing depends on the logistic identification of the part on the order item: If it is a production part, the order-specific production parts list can/should be generated for this part, if it is an order part, the requirement request can/should be made.A text article on an order item is first treated logistically like an order part for technical release, a requirement request can (not necessarily!) be made. It should be noted that text articles do not have a unique identification or a separate MRP account, so it is not possible to check whether the text article has already been passed on to the purchasing department as a requirement request. It is therefore recommended to always check the document history of text articles carefully: a corresponding warning will be issued. Functionality: Via the menu item 'Activities - Technology - Release order item' you reach the window 'Release order item'. When you select an order, all parts that have been set to the status 'Design check' appear. By double-clicking you reach the window 'Release order item'. Here you can process the individual part, for example, by inserting a revised bill of material or by choosing Edit order item' to switch directly to the order and edit the item there. In the field 'Characteristics' you can also insert or delete items from the characteristics list. You can also enter notes in the lower part of the window. Save your entries with OK. With 'Release' you can complete the position. The status of the item is now set to 'Create bill of material' and released for the next departments. If the button \"Release\" is pressed, the standard disposition is initiated. This means that either the item goes to the status warehouse reservation, a requirement request is created or a production bill of materials is exploded. The technical release then takes place automatically. In the case of the auxiliary disposition menu items, the system first creates the subsequent document without the item already being technically released. This is also useful if you first explode the bill of material, then go to work scheduling for checking, and only release the item after the check. Overhangs: If there is a stock on hand for a disposable part of the order item, a partial stock reservation is created via a stock reserve document if the option \"Consume surplus quantities automatically\" is set. If the complete order quantity is available, the complete order quantity is also reserved by the warehouse. In case of partial quantities, the reserved quantity is reduced by the following document (part request or requirement request). Available production parts with minimum stock: These parts are always given the status 'stock reservation' when they are released for sale. If stock is available, a stock return document is automatically created during the technical release. If there is no stock and you want to produce these parts for this order, you must explode the production BOM (menu: \"Edit->Production BOM->Explode\"). Then the status of the order item changes to \"BOM created\". Disposition: It is also possible to order a partial quantity for production parts from the technical release or to take it out of stock. For this purpose the menu is used, in which all possible entries are activated, if there is the possibility to use them here. There is one exception: If a stock-keeping part or an order part is in the order item, a partial quantity cannot yet be produced. The possibility of the partial disposition \"production order\" exists at the moment only for production parts that are available for disposition. If the quantity of a posted partial MRP document is changed after a part request has been created, the quantity of the part request and the production order items are also changed. The production orders receive an identifier that they must be reprinted and appear again in the worklist. Effects of technical release: In addition to the follow-on documents that are created during the technical release, the new status itself has the following effects. For example, only technically released items can be delivered. Otherwise, the creation of the delivery note would be cancelled. On the other hand, the part that is hidden behind the sales item is frozen. Thus, all changes in the order item that would influence the part (attribute changes, for example) are prohibited. List window: This window is used to list order items for which the technical release has not yet been performed. The technical release can also be reset in this window and the exploded bill of material can also be deleted. Input window: In this window the further processing of the order item can be controlled. The disposition can be started automatically according to the standard by simply releasing the position via the release button. However, if the order item is to be scheduled differently than it is normally scheduled, the menu can be used to decide which scheduling path this order item should take. So if the part on the order item is normally withdrawn from the warehouse, the item is posted to the status warehouse reservation when it is simply released. However, if the goods are to be produced directly for this order item due to a lack of stock, the production parts list can be created via the menu and the item can then be released. It then ends up in the production process and appears in the next parts planning as an order part to be manufactured in production. Furthermore, a special bill of material, production comments and characteristics can be created and defined in this window, which control the further course of the production process (e.g. length specifications, material specifications, etc.) If the production parts list is to be deleted again due to inadvertently incorrectly set characteristics, this can also be done via the menu. Furthermore, it should be noted that for companies that automatically trigger the complete further processing (production order and all necessary dispositions) with the technical release of order items to be produced, it is possible to delete all automatically created subsequent documents when deleting the parts list. If several order items have been combined in a parts scheduling system, the release and parts list for all combined order items is carried out after a user query.

In principle, all information in the host system for the identification of the goods (supplier, article, etc.) can be printed. The definitions for label printing are determined on a project-specific basis. HESTIA WMS has no special requirements for list printers, all lists are defined for A4 portrait format. Document: Under this menu item, the function for printing delivery notes, invoices (both documents from the host system), can be called up. Reports: Under this menu item the function for printing lists (article lists, storage bin lists etc.) can be called up. Printing is done via the layout selection and its parameter input and printer selection. Article label: The function for printing article labels (barcodes) can be called up under this menu item. Printing is carried out via item selection, layout selection and its parameter entry, printer selection and label printing. Storage location label: The function for printing storage bin labels (barcodes) can be called up under this menu item. Printing is carried out via storage location selection, layout selection and its parameter input, printer selection and label printing.

The warehouse employee tries to place the goods in the same storage bin where goods from this picking list are already stored.

The pick to be made is automatically assigned to the warehouse employee. He has the choice of specifying a picking list (picking list selection via picking licence) or simply selecting the next pending pick without taking a picking list into account (automatic picking list selection). When parking, the warehouse employee is shown whether the goods need to be consolidated (e.g. because goods from other picking zones still need to be picked for this picking list) and whether goods from this picking list are already picked in another storage bin. The warehouse employee tries to place the goods in the same storage bin where goods from this picking list are already stored. This is similar to the storage of goods at PickAndCollect. The strategies for filing are defined customer-specifically in each case. The following three entrances are available: The Settings menu item is used to define the forklift trucks assigned to the employee and to select the picking zone in which the warehouse employee works. The second selection only appears if there is more than one truck picking zone. Transport of goods: In the picking process, picked goods are placed in storage aids (PickAndCollect) or the goods are already in storage aids (PickAndDrop - storage aids). These are placed in storage bins after the picking process. In the case of large parts, it is ensured that these are placed on a storage aid after picking, which in turn is placed in a storage bin. The following entries are available: Under Settings, the warehouse employee selects the forklift truck as with PickAndDrop. Then he can pick up the licence to be transported. If the settings have not been run through, the selection of the stacker appears automatically when the other menu items are selected. Packing for customer: If all the goods on a pick list have been picked and are in the appropriate place in the shipping area (this includes the packing, wrapping and staging zones), the goods can be packed and shipped. Remarks: The goods can be consolidated before dispatch. There are several possible combinations with \"Pack for customer\". See also \"Processes - Outgoing goods - To customer - Consolidation customer\". Packing can only be started when all the goods in a pick list are in exactly one shipping zone. If the goods are in several shipping zones, they must first be brought to the zone where the packing process takes place. Normally this is done with \" Processes - Outgoing goods - To customer - Goods transport - Transport picked licence\", but it is also possible with \"Processes - Outgoing goods - To customer - Consolidation customer\". The following entries are available:. Consolidation Customer: After the picking process, the picked goods are placed on the storage locations. Depending on the case, an order of the goods suitable for shipping can already be achieved when picking the goods or when subsequently depositing the goods. If this is not the case, the goods can be consolidated. This saves space and thus shipping costs. Remarks: The employee is already informed when the picked goods are deposited that they have to be consolidated. As a rule, the goods are then placed in a staging area so as not to get in the way of goods that can be packed directly. The function \"Processes - Outgoing goods - To customer - Pack for customer - Pack licence\" can also be used for the pick containers standing in the staging area.

Completely picked goods that leave with parcel services are deposited in the packing area, completely picked goods that leave with the forwarding agent are deposited in the wrapping zone. Goods that are not completely picked are normally placed in the staging area. If goods are in the staging area, a warehouse worker can continue the picking process for the pick list assigned to the goods by scanning one of the pick containers located in this zone. HESTIA then determines the pick list independently, i.e. the process of explicit pick list selection is omitted. This is exactly what the two menu items \"Pick list selection via pick licence\" and \"Pick on pick licence\" are intended for. The difference between the two processes is that with \"Pick list selection via pick licence\" the warehouse worker is prompted to use a new pick container (see \"Pick container selection\"), while with \"Pick licence on\" the warehouse worker picks up the already deposited pick container again and continues the picking process in it. In both cases, you can then continue with \"Assign open picks\".

The warehouse worker is then asked to specify the pick container: All open picks of a pick zone can only be assigned to one warehouse worker at a time. Choice of pick container: The warehouse worker now scans an LHM or a picking trolley/box into which the picked goods are collected. If this PRT does not yet exist in the system (e.g. because the numbers are taken from a tear-off roll), the PRT is newly created in the system by specifying the PRT type (standard container).

After the pick has been processed, the system automatically checks whether there are other corresponding picks in the queue. If so, the employee is immediately assigned the next pick. Remarks: The choice of the storage location is free. However, the employee is shown whether the picked goods must be consolidated and in which storage bins there are already picked goods for this sales order. This display helps the employee to find a suitable storage location. If the loading equipment suggested for picking is not accessible to the forklift, another equivalent storage equipment can be used. Drop picking licences / Drop all licences: If, for some reason, picked licences are left on a forklift truck, they can be dropped with this guided activity: after selecting the forklift truck, the dialogue for dropping the goods appears immediately (identical process to PickAndDrop Customer: Dropping goods). Picked licence transport / goods transport: If, after picking, goods are not placed in one of the three zones provided for this purpose but, for example, at a transfer point, the picked goods must be transported onward at a later date. For this purpose there is the guided activity \"Transporting the picked licence\". After picking up the goods, the warehouse employee is immediately in the dialogue for depositing the goods (identical process to PickAndDrop customer: deposit goods). Putting goods down: If the picking process is ended (automatically or by means of \"ESC\") and goods were actually picked onto the picking container, the dialogue for depositing the goods appears."

        "output": "General search terms. Why search terms in dictionaries?: Since the company name should be the one that appears on the company's letterhead, it should be possible to find this company using other, simpler names. This is what the search terms were created for. All search terms are collected in a \"dictionary\". There are different dictionaries for partners, parts etc. These dictionaries can be imagined like a business directory, which assigns names to the corresponding telephone numbers. Also in the business directory a number can be found under several names and branches. If the name of a partner has been inadvertently overwritten as a search term, so that the partner can no longer be found via his name, or no search terms are available for the imported objects after a data import, the search terms can be rebuilt. When creating a new company, the company name is automatically saved as a search term. However, you can now save any number of additional, perhaps simpler search terms for this company. Assignment of search terms: By linking the keywords to the main object by default, it is possible to find an object in several searches. For example, the keywords that are entered in the customer mask are stored directly at the company. This makes it possible that the company can also be found with this keyword in the supplier search afterwards, provided that the company is entered as a supplier. In ClassiX® we say that the company also has the role of supplier. This concatenation can be optionally switched off if only the customer with this keyword is to be found. Search terms are usually created manually by the user. However, in some modules, fixed data fields are also always included in the search terms, for example, the name of the person in the person editing module. If the name of the person is now changed, the new name is also created as the person's search term without the old one being deleted. The person can now be found using the old and the new name. Note: If in the example of the person the name has been changed because of a spelling mistake, the user should make sure that the corresponding search term is deleted. Limiting the search results: To keep the search clear and not take too long, the maximum number of search results displayed is limited to 100 when the window is opened. If the search term is simply left empty and confirmed with Enter, only the first hundred search results will appear. If you really want all search results to be displayed, you must set the desired number in the menu Options->Number of objects or select the item \"All objects\". Now, if the search term is empty, the system asks whether all records should really be displayed so that you don't have to wait for all search results by mistake. This can take some time depending on the amount of data. Search methods: The search is inaccurate by default. This means that if only the first part of a word is entered, the system will search for data beginning with that part of the word. In addition, the machine allows the user to work with wildcards. If the entered search term starts with an asterisk followed by a word, the system searches all data that has this entered word anywhere in the search term. The question mark stands for exactly one character, which is unknown, in contrast to the asterisk, where it does not matter how many characters follow or precede. The question mark can therefore be placed anywhere in the word. Examples of this: Another way to perform searches is to use regular expressions in the search term fields. To do this, select \"Options->Search->Advanced search\" from the menu and enter the search conditions. Now all common regular expressions are available for the search. For example, if you are looking for all companies ending with GmbH, enter the following search term: GmbH$ The search terms entered are not case-sensitive."

        "output": "Access rights for users. Overview: The ClassiX® system offers a highly differentiated system for monitoring and restricting access rights. This security system of ClassiX® is optional, it can, but does not have to be used. However, a user can modify his database so that access is no longer possible without monitoring access rights. The access rights are described in the core by security objects. In addition, evaluations(stored lists) of authorised users can be activated for other - unauthorised - users. Security objects can prevent or allow the following: ¹) This refers only to persistent objects from the database. For transient objects there is no control of access rights! The security objects describing the access profile of a certain user are linked to the CX_USER object for this user and are activated at login (logged in to the ClassiX® system). Registered security objects remain active until the next start of the ClassiX® system, they cannot be deactivated again. Now there is still the possibility that unauthorised persons gain access to sensitive data with self-written InstantView® code. You can also protect yourself against this. If a database contains a master security object, any unauthorised access with InstantView® instructions is impossible. If you still want to see certain data, you have to develop your own programs in C++. If someone has the necessary means and energy, he/she can access not only the data objects but also information about the stored classes. That means this is a serious possibility to read or even modify protected data without authorization! In the last section of this overview we show how this entrance gate can also be closed!. Access to data fields: As mentioned above, read and write access to certain data can be prevented. The scope of such restrictions may relate to The information on this level firstly affects all data fields of an object, including dynamic data fields of course. Different access rights can be assigned for certain access expressions (CX_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY). Objects of the class CX_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY are always subordinate to either a CX_CLASS_SECURITY or a CX_OBJECT_SECURITY object. The most general case of a description of read/write permissions applies to all access expressions for all objects of a certain class or classes derived from it, the most specific case concerns a very specific access expression when it is applied to a very specific individual object. Different security objects of the classes CX_CLASS_SECURITY and CX_OBJECT_SECURITY²can be combined with an object of the class CX_SECURITY_SET. By combining general and more specific statements, access rights can often be described with only a few objects. ²) this also applies to CX_MESSAGE_SECURITY and CX_SECURITY_OPTIONS, see below CX_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY objects never occur directly in the security set. If the ClassiX® system checks the authorisation of an access via access printout to a certain object and a security set is active, the first element of the set decides which one is applicable for the case. If none of the security objects in the security set provides a statement, access is prohibited. If a security object is active in the ClassiX® system, the following applies: Everything that is not explicitly allowed is prohibited! But this is no problem: A CX_CLASS_SECURITY object for the class CX_CLASS (and derived), which allows everything, forms a background for special deviating specifications. The order in the security set plays a role here: general statements may only come after the specific ones. Security sets may contain further security sets as an element. All descriptions of access rights can be represented by security objects in the correct arrangement in a security set. As a set, you can create subgroups of certain rights and then assign a combination of such subgroups to a user in a security set that combines the subgroups. There is another possibility: Put specializing security objects in the collection spezializations of a security object with a general statement. It makes no difference in terms of content whether the security objectS1 describing the special cases is located in a set before the object with the general definition S0, or whether only S0 is found in the set and S0 refers toS1 via specializations. However, the latter method is faster. Fewer objects have to be tested,S1 only checks if the parent object could already make a statement (see performance notes). What happens in case of unauthorised access?: The AdjustView command resets the NON_SELECTABLE state if write permissions exist. By adjusting an input window with AdjustView before the user's input, one avoids that the final DrainWindow with error 638 can fail. Create and logically delete objects: Permission or prohibition for this can only be given per class - with CX_CLASS_SECURITY objects. Everything that has been said about the possibilities of combination when it comes to access to data fields also applies here. The following InstantView® commands are affected:. Lock InstantView® messages: When a security object of the class CX_MESSAGE_SECURITY is logged on to the ClassiX® system (usually as an element of the logged on CX_SECURITY_SET object), it blocks the message. The following InstantView® commands are affected: It makes sense to use the TestMsg instruction to adapt the menus or buttons of an application in such a way that the affected sub-applications cannot be selected in the first place. Special messages for blocking functionality: In some modules of the AppsWarehouse®, functionality is limited due to blocked messages. The following messages are defined:. Disable Monitor-Window: With the monitor window, the InstantView® interpreter is available for interactive execution of commands, also with access to the objects in the database. This possibility should not be available to every user. An object of the class CX_SECURITY_OPTIONS provides 96 bits with which special system functions can be explicitly permitted - as soon as such an object is active. At present, only bit 0 is occupied and assigned to the start of the monitor window. Summary: The access to a company's data in the database of the ClassiX® system can be controlled on different levels: Objects of class CX_MESSAGE-SECURITY control access to sub-applications. The class CX_SECURITY_OPTIONS allows or blocks certain system functions / system options - currently only the call of the Monitor-Window."

The core functionality of this module is that for each service call the employee who is to take care of the service call can be directly assigned. For this purpose, the employee can be assigned his capacity by first selecting the employee concerned via the employee list and then opening the capacity planning via the menu item \"Edit->Set->Capacity planning\".

The button then determines the first member of the working group who has the specified capacity (duration) at the specified time. If no working group is specified, all employees of the employee master data are searched.

        "output": "Parts consumption: This app is used to display parts consumption. It shows which quantities of one or more parts have been consumed in an adjustable period of time. This app is intended as an aid for logistics. Related to this are the apps Parts Usage (intended for use by technology) and Parts Usage (intended for use by service/sales). If you generally want to evaluate the use or non-use of a part in a certain period, you can do this by means of an inspection run.In addition to the output of the list with the parts with consumption in the selected period, the complementary list with the parts without consumption in this period is always output in parallel. The following movements are referred to as part consumption:Goods receipts that have not been put away (MRP goods receipt)Production order items that have not been put away (dispositive production). Outsourcing The parts are selected by means of the part selection window, which opens after pressing the toolbar button or the \"Select parts\" button or simply dragged and dropped into the list. With drag&drop, parts rolls are also accepted.By selecting/restricting the staging types of the parts (MRP parts, stock parts, etc.), you can control which parts consumption (goods receipts, MRP production, stock removals) is taken into account in the evaluation. If, for example, only stock parts are selected (staging types: warehouse management, manual stock, remaining quantity, Kanban, own provision of stock), then the planned parts consumption is not included in the evaluation. As a side effect, the list of \"parts without consumption\" also provides a so-called list of slow-moving items. The total consumption of a part results from the sum of the above movements. The evaluation of the total consumption is done according to the following logic: If an incoming invoice has been issued for these goods in the selected period, the price is taken from this invoice and multiplied by the total sales quantity. If no incoming invoice has been created, the system searches for other documents and uses their price for the calculation. When posting the above-mentioned documents, they are entered in the parts transaction file in relation to goods receipt or production - each subdivided into year and month. The corresponding quantities are registered here. Thus, when creating the parts consumption, only the parts operation files of the individual document types have to be fetched and the quantities compiled from them. An exception to this is the removal from storage. Here the quantities are not collected in the parts procedure folder, but in the warehouse statistics. This can be accessed via the warehouse account of the part. A record is created in the list for each part and for each period with consumption, unless the part does not have an operation folder. (For more on this, see the options window)Parts without consumption are listed in the tab \"Parts without consumption\". A double click opens the stock movement window for the clicked period. Attention! Validity is not taken into account in part consumption, i.e. consumption across exchange objects is not displayed! Attention (only companies with separate client turnover)! If the option \"Split variant parts\" is set via the options window, the split display is incorrectly displayed for clients whose material logistics are not separated according to domains/company codes. The total sum of all variant part characteristics is displayed behind each characteristic of a variant part. This is also not possible to separate subsequently, as the conditions for this are defined solely in the transaction descriptions. (What is consumption of one company, what is consumption of the other?) Attention! If a part is marked as \"constructive assembly\", it is not displayed as \"consumption\"! From the dispo account , the parts consumption statistics can be accessed via the \"Parts consumption\" group. If this way is chosen, the consumption of the last 12 months is displayed in the list, whereby the displayed filter remains on the currently valid period.

        "output": "Evaluation of order costs: This module is part of the final costing. The actual costs incurred for the sales orders can be listed according to the invoicing status (not invoiced/partially invoiced/invoiced) of the respective sales order and the stock orders can be listed according to the processing status (stored, provided, production order, etc.). The setting for the selection of the sales and stock orders are initialised so that the current \"Unfinished products\" are listed.The sales orders can also be listed together with the internal work orders assigned to them. Pre-selection by order type is also possible.All actual costs up to the selected accrual period are listed; a from - to periods list is also possible. Orders without costs can be hidden.IMPORTANT! Before calling up the job cost evaluation, the suppressed errors of the individual database operations must have been checked and corrected. Only in this way can the correct result be determined. Missing data in parts can lead to these not being taken into account in the order cost evaluation. Whether all documents assigned to the order have been posted can be checked with the context menu\"Display all successors\".If the order items are for a part with the staging type Kanban, no disposition, manual warehouse without main warehouse management or Kanban semi-finished product, the cost value on the order item is displayed in the ACTUAL costs column \"Warehouse purchased parts\".Orders are always assigned to a cost unit, i.e. the costs posted to an order are also posted to the cost unit and can be viewed via the cost unit totals list or the cost type evaluation per cost unit. However, it may well be that costs are only posted to cost units - without specifying an order - which is why there may be differences between the details of the costs in this order cost evaluation and those in the above-mentioned other cost unit lists. Accrual period: The accrual period defines up to which point in time or from which period costs are to be used for the calculation of order costs in the list. The accrual period is not used to select the orders directly, i.e. you can use it to select orders that were created in a specific period. If the \"from-to period\" checkbox is not set, all bookings with costs up to the accounting period are taken into account. If the \"from-to-period\" checkbox is set, only bookings with costs that were booked between the two accounting periods are taken into account. Check options: Various options are available for checking the order cost evaluation via the context menu (right mouse button) of the list (see). Display of recalculated actual documents: Documents are automatically entered for the final costing when they are posted. The current costs are determined from the standard value of the order part or the material and labour costs of the production part. If costs could be determined, the document is displayed with the list \"posted documents\". In the case of missing costs or other errors due to incomplete or incorrect data, the document is listed with the suppressed errors. Display of all subsequent documents (from document history).: Display of all documents that were posted with the order and normally contain actual costs for costing. You can output this list \"posted documents\" selected according to documents with and without costs. Documents without costs were not posted in the final costing and must be checked and posted via the module \"suppressed errors\". The unposted vouchers can be corrected in the selection \"Displayvouchers without costs\" via the context menu of the list\"Display suppressed errors for voucher\". Display of recalculated actual material costs: A list of all parts that were posted for the order in the cost estimate with actual costs. Total costs: Displays the sum of the actual costs for the selected rows. Recalculate actual costs: Here you can recalculate the actual costs of the stock movements (i.e. stock removal and stock placements), the exploded parts lists (e.g. JIT, KANBAN parts and manual stock) and the PDC working times for the orders selected in the list box. Normally, only the documents that are already taken into account in the final costing are recalculated. However, by setting the checkbox \"Check successor documents not taken into account\", you can ensure that all successor documents are checked. Each document is booked out of the recalculation and booked in again as selected with the valid costs on the document date or the validity date that can be entered in the mask. The new actual costs are immediately written into the documents and thus into the post-calculation of the order. By recalculating the documents with the document date, you only have the possibility to approximate the old status. Therefore, the call of this function should be carried out with care, preferably in a test environment first. For tracking purposes, all changes to the actual costs of the recalculation are written to the file \"NeuBerechnungIstKosten_Datum.log\" in the temporary directory. Hint: Note that the system-wide validity date is changed when recalculating. Module name: statwprg.mod. Classes: -. Security: In addition to restricting access rights via the class and its data fields, the module can be restricted in its use via some of the received messages. Document identification: If a document is found in the post-calculation that has the flag realEnd.counter2 = 1 AND realEnd.counter3 = 1, then this document must first be booked out!If a document is found in the post-calculation that has the flag realEnd.counter[[2] = 1 AND realEnd.counter[[3] = 1, then this document must first be booked out! Explanation regarding night runs: As soon as a document has bit 1, 2 or 5, it is no longer used for the night run. If such documents are booked out and in, the calculation is booked immediately. During operation, each document to be booked out must be checked to see whether it must also be booked out of the calculation. The module recognises this at the realEnd.counter3=1. If the item is now booked out, changed and booked in again by the normal booking, the module recognises at the realEnd.counter2 that this document must be booked back into the post-calculation. The realEnd.counter2 is never deleted from the document once it has been set. It is the indicator that the document has already been posted once in the post-calculation.During operation, each document to be booked out must be checked to see whether it must also be booked out of the calculation. The module recognises this by the realEnd.counter[[3]=1. If the item is now booked out, changed and booked in again by the normal booking, the module recognises by the realEnd.counter[[2] that this document must be booked back into the post-calculation. The realEnd.counter[[2] is never deleted from the document once it has been set. It is the indicator that the document has already been posted once in the post-calculation. If the realEnd.counter5 is set on a document, it does not need to be booked out of the post-calculation before normal posting and it does not need to be booked in again! However, this module takes care of this check, it does not need to be checked in any other module!If the realEnd.counter[[5] is set on a document, it does not need to be booked out of the post-calculation before normal posting and it also does not need to be booked in again!!! But this module takes care of this check, it does not need to be checked in any other module!. Online posting of vouchers - principles: If the voucher has already been posted to the final costing, it must be booked out beforehand. This is usually implemented via the BookItem and UnbookItem macros of the respective module. Here, before the document is posted out of its normal posting, it is first checked whether bit 3 of the realEnd.counter is set, i.e. whether the document is also posted in the post-calculation: transaction Copy(realEnd.counter3) iftransaction Copy(realEnd.counter[[3]) if { } After posting via the normal update, it must then also be checked whether the document is to be posted to the final costing: Bit 2 of the realEnd.counter s provides information about this. transaction Copy(realEnd.counter2) iftransaction Copy(realEnd.counter[[2]) if { }."

        "output": "Stock: Each warehouse must be created in the CyberEnterprise business OS. This describes a specific room, a specific building, which serves as a warehouse for parts. Within a warehouse, the individual storage locations must also be stored in the system as storage bins. In CyberEnterprise business OS, warehouses and their storage locations are not only textual information but describe accounts with their respective stock values. (see also the processing of a warehouse posting in an OLAP network from accounts).A warehouse can be assigned an administrator, an owner and/or a cost centre. The address of the manager is taken over as the address of the warehouse (as a copy). This address can be overwritten manually. In the 'Control' tab, the type of warehouse can be declared as a consignment warehouse, a customs warehouse or a manual warehouse. Such warehouse types can also be specified in more detail in the form of classification terms (see below). Furthermore, warehouses can be marked as non MRP if the stocks of these warehouses are not to be taken into account in MRP from requirement and stock lists. In addition to these indications, different classification keys can be assigned to a warehouse, e.g. in order to assign the warehouse to a storage type (e.g. in addition or optional to the above mentioned type indications), to a (total) storage area, etc. The classification keys can also be assigned to the storage type (see below). Once assigned, the classification terms can be supplemented with characteristics in order to optimally control warehouse management. In the standard system, the term \"storage type\" is predefined as a classification term for a warehouse with the identifier \"STORAGE_TYPE\". Sub-concepts for freely definable storage types are Block storage, open-air storage, high rack storage, picking warehouse, shelf storage, etc. The storage bins assigned to a warehouse can also be assigned to classification keys (see there classification key \"PICKING_ZONE\" for picking zones or storage areas); it is up to the internal organisation to find an optimal structure of the information for the company. By assigning warehouses to company codes, logistical control (e.g. specification of minimum stock levels) and stock monitoring can be further differentiated. If a company code has been assigned, the\"no disposition\" indicator should also be set. The identification as \"chaotic warehouse\" serves to have the system automatically allocate an empty storage bin when goods are received. In the tab 'Domains' it can be specified whether and to which domains the stock of parts in storage bins of this warehouse should be divided. (Not implemented in the standard system). Input window: This window is used for the maintenance of bearings. You can select a warehouse by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". In the field 'Number' you can assign a warehouse number or the system will give a consecutive number. Then enter a short name and a description for the new warehouse. If, for example, the new warehouse is an external warehouse, you can mark this with a tick in the \"Type\" section. In the field 'Administrator' you can, for example, select an employee who is responsible for the warehouse. In the tab 'Control' a formatting for storage locations can be entered. (see group description) Press 'OK' to save your entries. With 'Edit - Storage bins' the listing of all existing storage bins of the warehouse opens. You can now, for example, add new storage bins or revise an individual storage bin by double-clicking on one of the entries. With 'Display all stock movements' you can call up a list of all movements in the warehouse. From this list, you can access the article in the parts master or the storage bin and from there to other points by clicking on 'Edit'. List window: Serves to list the warehouses. You can search for an individual warehouse by number, name or designation or sort the complete list according to individual criteria. With 'New' you create a new warehouse. The input window 'Warehouse' will then open. To edit an existing warehouse, click on the desired entry in the list window. The input window 'Stock' appears.

        "output": "Storage: General Price formation on the positionStorage of excess quantities from customer ordersStorage of variant parts Cost centres Cost unit EvaluationInfluence of storage on the moving average price of the part Post CalculationMobile storage. General: You can post warehouse parts that were entered in the goods receipt to the warehouse or enter other goods receipts (e.g. surplus stock removal ). The other putaways can be assigned to a cost object in order Attention! For QA parts, putaways can only be made if quality assurance documents have been posted for the corresponding goods receipt to be put away. The open quantity of the goods receipt is determined automatically. The following formula is used for this: Sum of all QA quantities - quantity provided to GR - putaways already posted - returned quantity = new quantity for putaway (goods receipt). Example: Goods receipt item 10 pieces has the following successors: = 1 piece open for new storage position ( 7 pieces - 5 pieces - 1 piece ) As no quality assurance has been booked for the last 3 parts, they cannot be stored. Price formation on the position: There are always 2 prices on the storage position: The standard price of the part from the corresponding roll (production or order roll, depending on the logistics settings) and the price which is the current average price on the stock account or the price from the previous order. For newly created parts and immediate storage, the average price is not yet set. In these cases the field \"Price\" is writable and a valuation of the goods receipt can be made with this. After a one-time entry and storage, the price is set as the new average price on the warehouse account of the part and can only be changed afterwards by a physical inventory. Storage of excess quantities from customer orders: If a quantity from a sales order item which contains a variant part is to be put away, a subpart with the corresponding characteristic must first be created. During the putaway process, the system now recognises that this new subpart on the putaway document is a part belonging to the variant part. The putaway can therefore take place with the lower part. Storage of variant parts: Variant parts can only be put away if they have the indicator 'common warehouse account'. If this indicator is not set, then only a temporary storage can be created for a variant part. Cost centre: It is possible to assign a storage to a cost centre at any time by checking the box \"Cost centre\". This is conceivable, for example, if a certain part has been broken on the construction site by an own employee of a certain cost centre. This cost centre was then specifically debited with the replacement of this part. Now this cost centre has procured its own spare part and is to be credited. For this purpose, this cost centre must be specified on the storage. Cost unit: There is the possibility to relieve a cost unit by storing the goods, this is the case, for example, if an interested party wishes to receive a sample of a part in advance for inspection. In this case, there is not yet an order to which these costs could be linked. In this case it is a good idea to create a project (cost unit) for this interested party in which all costs are collected. The cost unit can be relieved by storing the part if it is not to your liking. Evaluation: Storage facilities will be provided with 2 prices: 1. price from previous documents (pricePer) 2. price from rolls (last.svpPricePer) The following rules apply for the determination of prices: For price 1: If a preceding document exists, its price is transferred to the goods receipt document, taking all conditions into account. If no preceding document exists, the average price from the warehouse account is used. If no average price exists in the warehouse account either, the price remains at 0. For price 2: If an order exists as a predecessor, the price is taken from the order roll. In the case of a production order as predecessor, the price from the production role. If the item does not have a predecessor, the logistics indicator is used to check whether the price should be taken from the order or production role. Influence of storage on the moving average price of the part: Which price of the goods receipt changes the moving average price and is thus evaluated in the warehouse statistics, now only depends on the setting for determining the average price on the client. If the option \"roll price\" is selected, the standard price from the procurement role is used for the valuation. If the option \"Document price\" is selected, the price from the previous order item including all surcharges and discounts. Post Calculation: In the post-calculation, a negative value is always included in the valuation for storage. Storage at cost objects always represents a credit (=negative debit). To determine the costs to be credited, the standard procurement type (purchased part / production part) and then the costs are taken from the corresponding role. However, there is one exception: If the putaway has a predecessor (i.e. too much was ordered for one order, the remaining quantity is put away), then the costs are determined from the order. Attention! If a goods issue was posted for a cost object via a purchased part, then the purchased part was converted as a production part and subsequently a goods receipt was created as a credit, then the positive stock removal value continues to be in the purchased parts from stock column, the negative goods receipt value can then be found in the production parts from stock column. Mobile storage: Mobile storage enables so-called unplanned bookings for a project, order or cost centre to be easily booked. These could be, for example, returns to the warehouse, i.e. parts that have been removed from a workshop warehouse or small parts warehouse for a project can be posted again with this function and the cost object can be discharged. Parts can be selected via storage aids or directly. Storage aids cannot be posted directly, they are only used to find the parts. Empty storage aids should be registered and storage aids with more than one part should be transferred. This booking should not be used as a rule, as planned bookings cannot be processed. Input window: This window is used for the maintenance of storage. You can select a putaway by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". If you want to enter a new putaway, press the OK button (number, date and employee are preset). Then you can add the individual putaway items, i.e. for example, you can post warehouse parts that have been entered in the goods receipt to the warehouse (Goods receipt button) or enter other putaways (e.g. defer excess goods removals ) (Insert button). With the button 'Insert' you can add items to the document that are not in the goods receipt list. The part master opens from which you can select and post further parts. With the button 'Delete' you can remove items from the document and cancel your booking. Position window: The item number is assigned automatically. For put-away that was not triggered by a goods receipt, the cost object can be assigned via menu or by right-clicking. List window: Serves to list the storage locations. Selection window: This window is used to select a putaway. Production document window: In this window, putaway items can be created from stock orders.

        "output": "Stock order: Internal orders are most often created as stock orders in order to increase the production parts in stock. However, they are also used to order reproductions for sales order items or generally for cost objects/projects (work orders). Internal: If it is necessary to reprocess a possibly already delivered sales order, a stock order can be created with a concatenation to the corresponding order item or the superior sales order. For this, only the order predecessor has to be selected on a newly created stock order item and (important for the subsequent creation of delivery notes) the type \"subsequent delivery\" has to be set. Now the stock order can be exploded and the production parts list can be adapted to the work to be carried out. In the exploded BOM, parts can now be added and a special routing can be selected that contains only the work sequences required for rework. All required parts are added to the BOM. The stock order item is then not put into stock after the completion of the subsequent production order, but is made available for this order. In this way it is possible to remanufacture parts of an order item (BOM level > 0) that may have broken during assembly at the construction site and then re-deliver them to the construction site via a delivery note. The costs for this stock order are then linked to the linked order item or linked order header for the final costing/order cost evaluation. Internal: If the storage order is only an internal work order (type=storage order), which is neither to be produced for a sales order item nor to be put into storage, the check mark \"No goods putaway\" must be set on the storage order item. Now a project, e.g. \"Maintenance of the production lines\" can be created and assigned to this stock order header. To do this, simply set the tick \"Cost object assignment\". Now either an existing project can be selected or by leaving the project field empty a new project can be created for this storage order. However, this is not absolutely necessary. The decisive factor is the tick \"No goods putaway\" on the storage order item. Stock orders that are neither assigned to a project or sales order nor have the check mark \"No goods putaway\" on the items are put away after completion of the production order. It is not possible to assign a stock order item to a sales order and at the same time uncheck the box \"No goods putaway\". This would mean that the costs of this warehouse order are assigned to the sales order, but the goods are put into storage at the customer's disposal. Internal order for the execution of rework: This type of order is used to define the rework for customer orders. You must select the order type \"internal order\" and the checkbox Rework. You can enter this order manually or create it using the \"Rework Wizzad\". With the Wizzard you only have to enter the old production order or job ticket, the finish dates and quantity. The system takes over the technical release and the creation of part request and production order for you. Internal: Deliveries to a branch or other establishment may not be recorded as a customer order because they must not affect the balance sheet, i.e. the value of the order may not be recognised as internal company turnover For this reason, it does not make sense to enter intercompany orders via sales orders. The warehouse orders are also suitable for this purpose. On the warehouse order, Intercompany can be selected as the \"type\" and a company with an address can be specified as the recipient. The data from the warehouse order header is copied to each new item. By filling in the recipient, the warehouse order item also receives the delivery status in addition to the MRP status, which means that it can be found in the picking list via its date (delivery or staging date). After disposition, the warehouse order item changes - like a sales order item - to the status: Ready for dispatch. Now it is clear that it still has to be shipped. Stock orders that are created and scheduled for replenishment of the warehouse are in the status: \"Ready: Production\" and must be put into storage. Attention! If stock-managed parts are included in the warehouse order for a subsequent delivery, complaint or intercompany type, these warehouse order items are posted to the status \"warehouse reservation\" and must be withdrawn (staged) from the warehouse via the picking list, just like order items! Subsequently, the delivery note is also created from here. Internal order as production planning (PPL): Production planning is used to replenish and plan the stock of purchased and manufactured parts. The planning is carried out in two stages:. Input window: This window is used to maintain internal jobs. You can select an internal job by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to open the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". On the internal order header, a project to which the costs are later assigned can be selected or automatically created. No project is created by default. If a project is to be created automatically, the checkbox \"Cost object assignment\" must be ticked before saving. As a rule, the employee is specified by the system as a result of the registration. When you press 'OK', the machine assigns a sequence number and the 'Insert' and 'Remove' buttons are released. You can now start to create items: With 'Insert' the window 'Internal job - Position' opens. First enter the order item and the quantity you want to have produced. Clicking on 'Part' opens the selection window of the part master, from which you can now select the corresponding part. Please enter the production date in the 'Date' field. In the lower part of the window you can insert or remove attributes from the list of characteristics. Click 'OK' to save the position and continue with the next one. If the internal order just processed is not a \"stock order\" but a \"work order\", a further text field \"Information\" appears in the item window. Position window: In this window the data of an item of an internal order is maintained. Option window: All settings can be made here. The window can only be closed with the \"OK\" button. List window: Used to list the internal jobs. Internal order - position overview: Used to list the items of the selected internal orders. Selection window: This window is used to select an internal job. Rework - Wizzard Window: This window allows you to easily create the rework for a sales order item.

In addition, the currency for stock valuation can be specified; a prerequisite for this is a validly registered currency table.An evaluation of the data of all parts of a client for a certain period results in the opening or closing stock value of the fixed assets tied up in the warehouse and is thus part of the monthly statement.A warehouse statistic for ALL parts, i.e. also dispositive parts that are temporarily stored in a storage bin, can simply be carried out without pre-selection of parts. To do this, simply open the warehouse statistics, set the statistics period to be closed and select the menu item \"Month-end closing\" directly. For all parts found in this query, the warehouse accounts are searched for and these are saved in a collection at the user object of the logged-in user. If this user calls up the warehouse statistics again with this option (all parts without preselection) at a later time on the same day, all parts and their warehouse accounts are not searched for again, but the objects saved from the user are used again for the next run. This speeds up the month-end closing process enormously if it had to be interrupted at a certain point.General note: The module can only be called up if financial years and periods are defined in the system.Notes on month-end closing in this module: If receipts without price/value were found during the month-end closing, they are displayed as failed after the month-end closing. The prices/values can then be entered in this result window. When prices/values are added to documents at the end of the month, a note is displayed if the warehouse part does not have an average price and this should be added to the logistics account. If the average price has been entered in the logistics account, this average price can be transferred to all documents without price/value by means of the transfer button (i.e. enter the average price per part in the logistics account and then press the transfer button). Search run (Services->Inspection->Materials management tab \"Stock account\") for stocked parts without average price with the option to set average prices for these from the roles (according to the set logistics indicator). If this run is executed again and again (read transaction), then fewer and fewer documents without valuation are created, which then have to be corrected at the end of the monthIMPORTANT! Before closing the warehouse statistics, the batch run errors of the individual database operations must have been checked and corrected. Only in this way can the correct result be determined. Functionality: Automatic keeping of statistics With each warehouse booking, outgoing and incoming quantities and values are automatically adjusted in the corresponding statistics period: Storage price depending on the setting in the client, the roll price or the document price. In contrast to the receipt and issue quantities explained above, the opening and closing stocks and values are not automatically adjusted on an ongoing basis, but are only determined at the time of the month-end closing . Also at month-end closing, stock transfer, stock correction, receipt and issue values are recalculated, as they may well be adjusted if the current average price changes. Stock issues are valued using the average price of the warehouse account. A change in the average price would therefore also mean a change in the issue value! Prepare statistics and execute immediately First you should select the desired evaluation period(s). By pressing the button (\"Select\") you can then call up the part selection mask, in which parts can be compiled according to different criteria. On the other hand, you can call up the statistics for entire warehouses; a warehouse selection screen opens for this purpose: For the purposes of the month-end closing, you should call up all warehouses. You can also transfer parts or their part roles to the list via drag & drop, as well as entire inventory documents or only individual items. After selecting parts or warehouses, the statistics are immediately executed automatically. Run statistics again If the warehouse statistics have already been called up once, you can change the selection of periods for the entries that appeared in the list. If you change the selection of periods, the entries in the list are deleted - since the list was originally set up for a different selection of periods - after pressing the button (\"Execute statistics\"), a new evaluation is carried out without having to select warehouses or parts again: the originally selected selection of parts or warehouses is retained until a new selection is called up or the window is closed. Display stock/value development If parts are called up via from - to periods, then all period data of these parts are displayed. The development of turnover and/or stock values over time is thus possible. However, an overall total across all periods is not displayed. Month-end closing: Selection of parts: Via the menu or symbol opens a part selection window through which specific parts or part number ranges can be selected. However, if the monthly closing is to be made for all parts in the system, it is not necessary to first select all parts via the selection screen. Only the statistics period of the period to be closed must be set and then the menu item \"Month-end closing (possibly continue)\" must be selected. Now the month-end closing is made for all parts. What does the month-end closing do? Within the framework of the month-end closing, the following steps are carried out by the system: In addition to or AFTER the monthly closing of the warehouse statistics, the stock turnover figures for all warehouse parts should also be carried out in a further separate step (this can also be carried out together via an option in the client ). The inventory turnover ratios can be displayed via a separate list format in the list of warehouse statistics or via the logistics account of the part. Inventory turnover ratios should only be determined after the month-end closing, because this is calculated from the final stocks of the last 13 closed months. If a month is not yet closed, there is also no closing stock. Hint: Note that when creating the month-end closing, the system-wide validity date is set to the last day of the current period to be calculated. If the evaluation is cancelled, the system-wide validity date is NOT reset to the current date, then care must be taken to reset the system-wide validity date to the current date. This is done via the main menu \"System->Change date->Session date\", there the field \"Validity date\". When should the month-end closing be made? The monthly closing should finally be carried out after the closing of a business period, otherwise the determined stocks/values (accrual) could be falsified by a further stock posting. If this is the case, it is indicated with a red dot. in the corresponding line/column: What can I influence when closing the month? In the options window, the auditor is offered the possibility of recalculating all average prices for the selected periods/parts/warehouses and saving them on the transactions (goods withdrawals and inventory documents) during the monthly closing. This operation takes longer than the 'normal' monthly closing, but it also provides a truer closing value, as each time an acquisition transaction changes, it changes the average price as if it were the last transaction in that period. It is also now possible to perform monthly closings over several periods in succession by selecting the periodic period. When closing the month, it is also no longer necessary to first run the stock statistics for the period over all parts and then start the month-end closing. You now only need to select the period and start the monthly closing. This is then run over all parts. There is an option to perform the monthly closing only for valid parts. To do this, check the box \"Only valid parts\" above the list before closing. If this option is activated, the test \"invalid warehouses with stock\" and \"invalid parts with stock\" should be carried out and corrected beforehand. Another option, activated by default, is to open another window following the month-end closing, showing all statistics that could not be closed due to stock movements without price. What happens after the closure and what about repeats of the monthly closure? For the individual parts and periods, it is stored who and when the last month-end closing was carried out. On the basis of this indicator and the consistency of opening balance+decrease+transfer=closing balance, it is checked whether the month has to be recalculated at all in the case of repeated month-end closing. If the entire month is nevertheless to be recalculated for all or for all selected parts, the menu item \"Repeat month-end closing\" must be selected. What is a month cube? A monthly cube (also simply referred to as statistics) is the statistical connection of several independent sources in which further statistical information can be collected that always refers to exactly the same data. In the example of warehouse statistics, the common sources are the following: 1. the part 2. the warehouse 3. the statistical period A monthly cube is the envelope around a part and its movements in a given storage location per month. What information does the monthly cube contain? It contains all the warehouse documents that have run for this part at this warehouse during this statistical period. It is also used to collect live movement values without having to collect and store them together overnight in any batch runs. It is therefore also possible to display all movements that have taken place in this period simply by pressing a button, as they are all stored in the monthly cube. This procedure is called OLAP (OnLine Analytic Processing) - the data is already posted to all relevant statistics when the document is posted and evaluated there. It may well be that a part A for statistics period July 2003 has 2 monthly cubes, one for warehouse B and one for warehouse C. --> If one of the three sources changes, a new cube is created. The following data are recorded in each cube :. Average price calculation: During ongoing operation, the average price is continuously calculated in the warehouse account (see average price calculation); this calculation can be checked or corrected in the warehouse statistics. The following rules apply to the calculation of the average price in the warehouse statistics at the end of the month: Important note: In the options window, you can use \"Average price - recalculation at month-end closing\" to save the calculated average price of the month-end closing on the stock removal documents. The correction run resets the current average price stored on the inventory and the valuation price if this is empty or zero. Manually corrected valuations on the inventory are therefore not overwritten. The prices determined during the run are written to the stock withdrawal and stock transfer documents. Changing these prices also changes the withdrawal value in the current period. Therefore, while this average price is being calculated, the value for stock placements, stock removals and stock transfers is also recalculated and saved for the period. Lowest value inventory: In the lowest value inventory, the lowest current price of a part in the period of the warehouse statistics is always determined for the determination of the actually existing warehouse values. This results in the following order of priority for the various logistics types of parts: Production parts: Lower price from average price from warehouse account (if not zero) and manufacturing costs from production roll. Purchased parts: Lowest price from supplier agreement price of A supplier (if no A supplier exists, then the supplier agreement price of the supplier from whom the last order was placed is taken), master purchase price and average price from logistics account. Stock keeper: To obtain a list of warehouse keepers, simply sort the warehouse statistics by the \"last departure\" column. Stock turnover ratio - stock turnover frequency: The inventory turnover ratio (stock turnover ratio) is the quotient of the average stock of the last 13 months (closing stocks) and the sum of the total quantities withdrawn (consumed) during this period. Determination of the average stock level: The total withdrawals of the last 13 periods are now divided by this average stock, resulting in the ratio. Stock turnover ratios are determined in a further step in the course of the monthly closing of the warehouse statistics. This is done via the menu \"Closing\" of the warehouse statistics. They can be carried out directly or during the night (if the night service is started via a batch file), or automatically with the monthly closing via an option (in the client). Stock turnover figures should only be determined after the month-end closing, because this is calculated from the final stocks of the last 13 completed months. If a month is not yet closed, there is also no closing stock. If the inventory turnover for a part has been determined via the determination run for saving the inventory turnover key figures, this is also displayed in the logistics account of the part and can be viewed at any time. The inventory turnover ratio is primarily used to adjust the stock level (minimum stock level) of parts to the quantities actually consumed. If a part has a minimum stock of 1 piece, but approx. 20 pieces were consumed per month, then the high ratio shows that the minimum stock should be increased. If, on the other hand, a part always has ending stocks of 25 pieces on average, but only 2 pieces are consumed per month, the result is a very low (below 1) key figure, which signals that the minimum stock should be reduced. List window: In the list, the parts are listed for which the stock statistics are to be carried out. In addition to selecting by parts or warehouse, parts or their part roles can be transferred to the list via drag & drop, as can entire inventory documents or only individual items. Exam window: The examination window can be reached via the menu \"Examinations -> Evaluate and correct existing examination results\". It opens automatically when an examination is started or by selecting the option \"automatically after the end of the month\" if examinations have failed when building up the monthly statistics. In order to obtain the most accurate assessment of the warehouse value, a possibility has been built in to check whether, for example, documents have no price/value or warehouse receipts and issues have been mixed up. The results of these checks are stored in the database and can be retrieved later at any time via the results window. The following plausibility checks have been implemented: In this window, all results of plausibility checks already carried out can be evaluated and corrected. First set the period in which the plausibility check was carried out. Then press the \"Display\" button or select a specific check from the combo box on the right side of the screen by unchecking \"All checks\". A list of monthly cubes is displayed. {img fileId=\"521\"} In the list under the heading \"Problematic monthly statistics\", all months of parts that failed the selected or one of the possible exams appear. A monthly cube is the envelope around a part and its movements in a given storage location per month. In the second column of the upper list, you can see which failed inspection this record is. So we now already know that a movement without value (price) was assessed in this month. To find it now, we simply click on the month cube with the mouse. Now its stock movements appear in the lower list. Movements for which a check failed are shown in red, as can be seen in the second entry in the figure above. You can now clearly see that this movement has the price 0.00€/1piece. However, since in the simplest case it is easy to see in the other movements with which price this movement should be valued, this price can simply be added by double-clicking on the red line. If no other document is posted in this month, a search must be made in the master data for a missing price. It is always advisable to add missing standard prices to the master data, as otherwise documents without prices may be created again and again. When leaving the line, the new value is taken over. Now data has effectively been changed that could influence the average price calculation. This is what the button \"Re-complete corrected\" in the upper part of the window is for. If this button is pressed, all monthly cubes now visible in the list are recalculated for the entire set period and the check for zero valuation is repeated. If the monthly cube is now OK, it no longer appears in the list after the end of the process. If other errors have crept in, they will continue to appear in the list. Of course, this correction option only helps with the one error \"transactions without value\". Change the chronological order of the documents: Once a withdrawal of goods has been booked before the receipt of goods, this is not so nice if you want clean statistics. This mishap can also be corrected via this screen by double-clicking on the movement and changing the date or time of the goods withdrawal to after that of the goods receipt. A subsequent click on the month cube updates the view and one can check whether the shift has worked properly. Cost sharing: Allocation of the various stock postings to cost types or accounts. The values can be used to post the change in stock in the FIBU. Edit devaluation: Goods may no longer be worth their full purchase value for various reasons. These parts are devalued by a percentage indication in the stock statistics. In the warehouse statistics, the devaluation percentage can be determined automatically for all displayed monthly statistics or for certain selected ones. The following simple rule is applied here: The devaluation defined in the warehouse has a higher priority. The devaluations can also be changed manually via the context menu \"Set devaluation manually\". If this menu item is selected, an editing window opens where the new devaluation percentage can be entered. An explanation must be entered for this. Likewise, the user is saved with the date and time of the change on the statistic that he or she has changed. Useful explanations would be \"goods are heavily soiled\" or \"water damage\". A devaluation is only permissible as long as it is not negative or below the automatic devaluation. So if the automatic determination has determined 25%, the devaluation cannot be set down to 10%. Options window: All settings can be made here. The window can only be closed via the \"OK\" button. Automated closure: The warehouse statistics can be automated in the application calendar with the following call : \"UpdateStockStatistics\" SendMsg(EXEC_QUERY_STOCK_STATISTICS). can be completed on the current date. Technical documentation: The module represents the data that is partly written into the corresponding data cubes by the transaction descriptions (see data model) and partly calculated during reconciliation (see above monthly closing). Transaction description: Example of goods putaway:. Month end (technical): During reconciliation, slots opening.quantity (opening stock), closing.quantity (closing stock) opening.value (starting value) and closing.value (ending value) are calculated and 'rewritten' into the corresponding LogCubes.

Input window: This window is used to maintain rearrangements. You can select a stock transfer by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". After you select an employee and press the 'OK' button, the machine automatically assigns a consecutive document number. With the button 'Insert' you can now create positions. Click 'OK' to save your data and the 'Close' button to return to the 'Transfer' window. You can now create further items or complete the document with the 'New' button. The stock transfer is booked on the warehouse account and the current stock is recalculated. In order to transfer a large number of storage locations as quickly and efficiently as possible, please refer to the documentation for the stock transfer assistant. Position window: To select a part either open the part master selection mask with the button 'Part' or enter the part number in the input field next to the button. The data from the part master and the current storage bin are also transferred to the window. Please enter the quantity of the parts to be transferred in the field 'Transfer quantity'. The button 'to storage bin' opens the overview of the storage bins, where you can now mark a new storage bin and select it with 'OK'. As an alternative to the overview, the number of a storage bin can be entered directly in the input field next to the button 'To storage bin'. If only one with this number exists, it will be displayed immediately. If several storage bins exist with the number entered, the objects found are displayed in the selection window of the storage bins. If no storage bin is found, a message appears. The item number is automatically preset, but can be changed. All storage locations where the part is/was present are displayed and only the \"destination warehouse\" can be a warehouse where the part has never been present. List window: Serves to list the stock transfers. Selection window: This window is used to select a stock transfer. Stock transfer assistant: With the stock transfer assistant you can carry out mass stock transfers: e.g. transfer all parts in one storage bin to another or distribute a part which is stored in many storage bins to other storage bins. The quantity can be selected as desired. Stock transfer criteria for partial storage bin accounts: If a stock transfer takes place directly from the cost object, storage bin, part or stock, all possible part storage bin accounts are filtered out. Only those with stock (pos. or neg.) and valid parts can be transferred. These accounts are displayed in the \"Possible items\" list. Select receiving storage bin:: The receiving storage bin is determined either by opening the bin selection window or by searching for a storage bin via direct entry. This must be a valid storage bin. You can re-determine the receiving storage bin at any time and thus distribute the part storage bin accounts to several storage bins. The cost unit makes the transfer posting to a project warehouse. Assign receiving storage bin: In order to assign selected objects from the list \"Possible items\" to the selected storage bin, they are assigned to the selected storage bin with the button is inserted in the \"positions to be moved\". If you want to assign a different receiving bin, search for To remove items from the 'items to be transferred' list, press the button, or the \"Del\" key on the keyboard and the selected objects are moved back to the \"Possible positions\". To remove objects from the composition permanently, select the desired objects in the \"Possible positions\" list and press the \"Del\" key on the keyboard. Selected objects can also be moved from one list to the other by dragging and dropping. Determine quantity to be relocated: The quantity can be changed as desired by double-clicking on an object in the \"items to be moved\" list. Normally the complete stock of a part is entered in the respective storage bin. If a stock transfer would result in negative stock, a Yes/No query window appears for the affected part storage bin account. Option window: Here you can make all presettings for the data exchange.

Furthermore, the EditWin also receives the Msg and executes the macro \"EditObject\" and saves the stock transfer if none exists yet. In the \"StockSwitchingWizardWin\", \"ObjectDropped\" is called if something was passed and then a vector of transient CX_CONTAINER objects is created. The CX_CONTAINERs receive the data fields with the information necessary to create a stock transfer item. So that the CX_CONTAINERs are not cleared away from the GarbageCollection, they must be saved in a vector. Possible transfer parameters for the message: - NULL -> only the window is opened - CX_ITEM objects or vector or collection of CX_ITEM objects - CX_STOCK_SPACE objects or vector or collection of CX_STOCK_SPACE objects - CX_LOG_CUBE objects or vector or collection of CX_LOG_CUBE objects - these objects are always checked to see if they are parts of storage bin accounts. The macro \"ObjectDropped\" creates a CX_LOG_CUBE Collection from the objects passed by calling itself recursively.

Input window: This window is used for the maintenance of removals. You can select a stock removal by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". You can create a new page out by pressing the OK button. Number, date and employee are automatically initialised. With the button 'Insert' you can now create positions. The window of the part master opens, from which you can select the part to be removed and transfer it to the window 'Removal from stock' by double-clicking. The data from the parts master are also transferred to the window. Enter the quantity actually withdrawn in the 'Quantity' field. With the button 'Insert' you can assign the part to an order by selecting the corresponding position via the order number and dragging it into the field. With the button 'Remove' you can delete these positions at any time. With 'OK' you save your data and with the 'Close' button you return to the window 'Outsourcing'. You can now create further items or complete the document with the 'Book' button. In this case the removal from storage is posted to the warehouse account and the current stock is recalculated. If, after posting, you notice that you have posted, you can call up the corresponding document again and change the quantity to zero at any time via the menu item 'Edit - Set quantities in selected items to zero' or directly in the item to the correct quantity and post again. The stock level will then be recalculated. Alternative part/quantity: If a check mark is placed in the field\"Alternative part / quantity\", a requirement can be provided with a different part and a different quantity. By activating the check mark \" Completely provided\" you can completely provide the predecessor documents of the retrieval item. In the other case, the system tries to post the quantity as the staging quantity, but if the units are not compatible, no staging quantity is posted, i.e. the This is convenient when you want to take out a part for an order item, but the part no longer exists (the part is invalid), but there is a replacement part that is compatible. Now the removal can be created for the compatible part. By ticking \"Alternative part / quantity\", the order item is then made available. If the tick is not set, the system assumes that it is an additional stock removal for the order, which means that the requirement is not yet covered. Example: 15 nails should be taken for a production order. Now, however, it is decided without further ado that the fixing should be done with one meter of double-sided adhesive tape. It is easy to create and book a retrieval of 1m of double-sided adhesive tape for this part requirement item with the check mark \"Alternative part / quantity\". The requirement of 15 nails is then booked out. Storage area: If a part is dragged into the picking position, the main storage bin of the part is taken over into the document as storage bin. If there is no main storage bin for the part, the warehouse selection list on the stock removal document is filled with all storage bins of the part in which a movement has once taken place. The first entry is then selected and set as default. Cost centre: By ticking the checkbox cost centre, it is possible at any time to also assign a production parts list outsourcing to a cost centre. This is conceivable, for example, if a certain part has been broken on the construction site by an own employee of a certain cost centre. This cost centre can then be specifically charged with the replacement of this part. Cost unit: There is the possibility of charging an outsourcing to a cost unit, this is the case, for example, if an interested party wishes to receive a sample of a part for inspection in advance. In this case, there is not yet an order to which these costs could be linked. In this case it is a good idea to create a project (cost unit) for this interested party in which all costs are collected. The cost unit can be relieved by storing the goods if the part is not to your liking. Create delivery notes: It is possible to create delivery notes from retrieval items. For this purpose, these must have an order item as a direct predecessor. The first order item with a delivery status is used, e.g. in stock removal the sub parts of a sales set are posted which has the delivery status in the order, in this case the sales set is drawn in the delivery note. If several stock removal items are assigned to the same order item, this is only used once in the delivery note with the open delivery quantity. Removal from stock items that directly have an order item with delivery status as predecessor are entered in the delivery note with the removal from stock quantity. Own supplies: If a material withdrawal is to be used to plan an internal provision at level 0 of a sales order, an internal provision document must be created for this material withdrawal. This is possible via the material withdrawal item directly via the toolbar button possible. The part, quantity and description are taken over. Post Calculation: In the post-calculation, a positive value is always included in the valuation for the removal from storage. Removals to cost units always represent a debit. To determine the costs to be debited, the standard procurement type (purchased part / production part) and then the costs are taken from the corresponding roll. Attention! If a stock-in was posted for a cost object via a purchased part, then the purchased part was converted as a production part and subsequently a stock-out was created as a discharge, the negative stock-in value continues to be in the purchased parts from stock column, the positive stock-out value can then be found in the production parts from stock column. Mobile storage and retrieval: Mobile outsourcing enables so-called unplanned bookings for a project, order or cost centre to be easily booked. These can be, for example, withdrawals from a workshop warehouse or small parts warehouse for a project can be entered with this function and the cost unit can be charged. Storage aids with several parts are completely booked out. In the case of storage aids with only one part, you can post partial quantities from the storage aid. Parts can also be selected directly via your number and storage location The system checks whether stock is available when booking! This booking should not be used as a rule, as planned bookings are not processed. Position window: Stock removals can be assigned to a cost centre, a cost object or specific documents (sales order or item, warehouse order or item). This ensures that the costs of the parts removed are charged to the cost originator. Grouping of selected items: The part, storage bin and quantity can be changed simultaneously for the items contained in the list. All items are assigned the same part and storage bin. The quantity is distributed proportionally to the items. This function is for parts that have pieces, sheets, plates or similar as a unit and all the rest is to be distributed to the bookings. Example: A part that is stored in plates and each plate has 3.125 m² as its area. Now 3 items are to be booked, but together they only have 2500000 mm ². Now this value can be changed in the quantity to \"1 plate\". After the OK button, the quantities of the positions are adjusted so that they result in 3.125 m² or 3125000 mm².

You can select a supplier by entering the supplier number in the Number field and confirm with RETURN. Suppliers (creditors) are identified via the menu item 'Partner'-'Suppliers' or the supplier symbol is called up. To create a new business partner, click on 'New' in the opened list. The Supplier window opens, in which you can now enter the relevant data. To edit an existing business partner, double click on the corresponding entry in the supplier list. The fields in the editing windows are confirmed with the 'Tab' key. At the end all new entries are saved by clicking on 'OK'. However, before creating a new vendor, you should first check whether a company entry for this business partner may already exist in the partner administration. If this is the case, you only need to add the role 'Vendor' to the existing data record. The number range is determined internally and can be easily set up and managed via the counter. However, the number ranges of customers and vendors must not be identical and must not overlap. Fields marked with \"italics\" represent data directly from the company. If something is changed in one of these fields, the change is applied to all roles and the company itself. All this data can also be maintained directly in the company input window. In the Article tab, all articles are displayed that have once passed through this supplier. Description of the columns in the list: The first column shows the article in the line. This is followed by the order number of this part from the selected supplier.

        "output": "Supplier agreement (AppsWarehouse modules): Supplier agreements hold suppliers specific data of an order item, such as a negotiated price, a separate order number or order text or the replenishment lead time and order quantity. The main supplier is also maintained in the supplier agreement. The Supplier Agreement shall also specify whether and which parts must be provided to the Supplier when ordering this part of the order. It should be noted here that the logistics code of the part must be changed to \"Order part with own provision\". This supply agreement must then also be entered in the logistics account in the list of the suppliers providing the parts. See here for more information. Via the list window you can get an overview of existing supplier agreements, for the purpose of electronic exchange you can export and re-import supplier agreements and you can compare the agreed price with the last incoming invoice price. Export/import of supplier agreements: The export and import of supplier agreements serves to update the supplier agreement data. If the supplier announces new prices for his products, it is, for example, easier to export all price agreements made with him to Excel, enter the prices here and then import the data. The Excel table can also be sent directly to the supplier so that he can enter his prices himself. It doesn't matter whether these are simple prices, price tables or prices with discounts/surcharges. Procedure:. Input window: This window is used to maintain supplier agreements. You can enter a new price agreement by pressing the Insert button and then selecting a supplier (from the order part) or an order part (from the supplier). You can also drag a supplier into the list of supplier agreements in the ordering section or an order part into the list of supplier agreements of the supplier. To create a supplier agreement from transaction data, simply open it with a double-click and save it in the supplier agreement window. The input window opens and you can now save it to create the supplier agreement. You can then enter the data for the agreement. For an explanation of how to enter a price, it is best to read the documentation on price processing. However, there is one special feature here, namely that you can also enter an absolute surcharge or discount in the conditions of this vendor agreement, which is then transferred as such into the purchase order. In the complex prices themselves, all prices are always calculated per unit of quantity! Here, you can use the order number at the supplier, which is then used, for example, in requirement coverage requests or purchase orders (when converting a requirement coverage request into a purchase order, a possibly changed order number on the requirement coverage request is given preference) or also a purchase order text, which is given preference over the \"normal\" purchase order text in the ordered article, since this test can differ from supplier to supplier. Instead of an order number, a conditional table can also be created, which points to different order numbers that are dependent on the value of an attribute, for example. If the order text from a supplier agreement has been transferred to a blanket purchase order, it can no longer be changed in the blanket purchase order! If you subsequently want to change this order text here in the supplier agreement, you will receive a warning message that there is an open framework order with a different order text and whether you want to update the order text on the framework order. Evaluation/maintenance of supplier agreements: This window is used to evaluate the supplier agreements, purchase contracts and outline agreements. In addition, the supplier agreements of a supplier can be maintained via Excel (possibly even by the supplier himself) using the export and import function in this window. Maintenance conditional tables: If an order item is a variant part, it is often not possible to specify \"simple\" values for the supplier number, replenishment lead time, price etc. in the supplier agreement, as various variants can be hidden behind an order item. The solution for this are conditional tables, for example the supplier's own number can be stored depending on the variant. Since it often happens that various details of a supplier agreement are stored in conditional tables, which are structured identically in each case because, for example, a price is associated with each conditional number, the mask \"Conditional table maintenance\" offers the possibility of synchronous table maintenance. Interface for EDIT_SUPPLIER_AGREEMENT:: Either the supplier agreement(CX_OVERWRITING_REF) is transferred or NULL is used to create a new supplier agreement. The purchase accounts of order part and supplier must be transferred in any case. The monitor is determined from the accounts with Call(DataCubeCore). The monitor is transferred with the messages SUPPLIER_AGREEMENT_CHANGED and SUPPLIER_AGREEMENT_CREATED to update the list. If NULL was transferred on the Stack Top, it is checked whether a supplier agreement already exists for the 2 transferred Purchase Accounts. In the macro CreateObject again Call(DataCubeCore) with TRUE to create the monitor if it does not exist. Then the Purchase Account of the order part is wrapped and a price value per quantity is created. DELETE_SUPPLIER_AGREEMENT: The monitor containing the supplier agreement to be deleted is transferred. If no supplier agreement is found, an error message appears. Then the wrapper of the order part Purchase Account is removed and the message SUPPLIER_AGREEMENT_DELETED is sent with the monitor as transfer parameter. Quality assurance: Description of some test scenarios for the new functionality of the conditional table for the order number.

Establishment: Setting up a workstation with telephone functionality depends heavily on the hardware used. A sound card and headset, alternatively loudspeakers and a table microphone are required. In order to optimise the voice quality, the volume of the microphone and incoming calls as well as the sensitivity of the microphone must be adjusted with the Windows volume control (or corresponding software from the sound card manufacturer). When doing so, the microphone should not be placed too loudly on your own headphones/speakers, as this can cause a reverberation effect.

Introduction: With the activity documents and the activity folders, ClassiX® provides a powerful instrument for the management, control and archiving of business communication. However, in order to be able to use these means in a meaningful way, some prerequisites are required. These will be explained in this document. In addition, the exact workflows for recording the transactions are described, including examples. In addition, there are some tips on how to handle the documents and folders. But one thing in advance: without consistent use, the best capture and visualisation tools make no sense. Transaction documents: An activity document always represents an activity. These can be divided into 4 types: In terms of functionality, all types offer the same, this classification is only for a better overview and for some automatic functions. For example, for letters and faxes, the corresponding templates are always loaded. A transaction document is now used to record all information about a transaction. In addition to standards such as date, subject, completed, etc., various fields are available. In addition, any number of recipients can be specified and in which transaction folders the document should be saved. To further increase flexibility, ClassiX® allows to attach any external files to a transaction. This way, almost everything can be recorded specific to the transaction. In order to also record a sequence of transactions in the overall context, follow-on documents can be created. In this way, the entire correspondence on a topic can be recorded chronologically. Most importantly, however, it is not only possible to record events from the past, but also to create a corresponding document at the same time as a letter is created. To keep the effort as low as possible, you can write and print your letter directly from the document. In addition, ClassiX® is also able to dynamically insert already existing data. Example: Creating a letter: The first step is to create a new letter process. Together with the editing mask for the document, Microsoft Word is also started and the preset document template is loaded. Here you can now write the actual text of the letter. To return to ClassiX®, Word can simply be closed. Now the additional data for the document are entered (subject, recipient, .). ClassiX® will then automatically add these data to the Word document. Now the letter just needs to be printed with ClassiX® print function. The most important thing is to use the transaction documents consistently. Only in this way is it possible to create a complete and well-organised archive of business correspondence over time. If letters, e-mails, etc. are always created together with a transaction document from ClassiX®, the additional work is limited. However, once some e-mails have been created, for example, it is quite a lot of work to record and integrate them afterwards."

After triggering one of the keys with an arithmetic operation, the value is displayed in the memory and is available for further calculation.When calculating, the rule \"dot before dash\" is observed. The maximum accuracy of the calculation is 8 decimal places by default. Change in the percentage calculation: For ease of use, the calculator includes two possible calculation methods for percentage calculation. In the following the differences are clarified by an example, where the calculation \"Add 15% to 20\" is to be carried out. Depending on the calculation method, the following sequence must be entered into the calculator to obtain the desired result. Change of the number format: The format of the numbers only refers to the display of the values in the memory, not to the input field. The following properties can be manipulated via the menu line:. Selection of a thousand separator: Use this menu item to activate or deactivate the current separator for thousandths of a number. The separator and the increment are determined by the set location data. Usually a \".\" or \",\" is used as a separator and the step size is normally \"3\". If the separator is activated by selecting \"yes\", for example, the number \"1234.56\" is displayed as \"1,234.56\". When deactivated with \"no\", the number remains unchanged. By default the thousand separator is activated. Number of decimal places: This menu item sets the number of decimal places with which the numbers in the memory are to be displayed. This varies from \"exact\", i.e. displaying all decimal places, to \"3\" and \"2\" to \"none\" decimal places. By default, the numbers are displayed with all decimal places. Rounding of results: This menu item defines the number of decimal places to which a result is to be rounded. If \"none\" is selected, the result is not rounded at all, otherwise it is rounded to the corresponding decimal place. No rounding is performed as standard. Calculation operations and special keys: In the following, the arithmetic operations that can be carried out with this calculator and first the special keys are presented in more detail. The calculator has two special keys, \"AC\" and \"CE/C\". The \"CE/C\" key clears the input field and the \"AC\" key also clears the memory. The memory is not only used to visualise the previous calculations, but also to use old values as output values again. To do this, simply double-click on the desired value with the left mouse button to transfer it to the input field. The settings of the current number format remain unchanged. In addition to the four basic arithmetic operations, the calculator provides a number of operators that require only one operand to calculate the result, which is fetched from the input field. The result is only returned to the input field. The following operators are provided:. Input via the keyboard: To simplify the input of numbers and not to have to \"assemble\" each number with the help of the corresponding keystrokes, a direct input of arithmetic expressions is possible in the display of the calculator. To do this, this field is clicked with the mouse, whereupon any expression can now be entered. If only a number or a number with a unit is entered, then this input is displayed again in the appropriate format (separation of number and unit) and remains on the display until an arithmetic operation is triggered. Technical Documentation: Any functionality needed to create a calculator is already available in the classes CX_NUMERIC and CX_VALUE. If this application appears to be relatively large, it is because the calculator was designed to be as comfortable as possible. The \"pure\" arithmetic operations, such as the basic arithmetic operations or, for example, the formation of reciprocal values, are all available via the above-mentioned objects. With objects of the class CX_VALUE, it is also checked whether the arithmetic operation may be carried out at all (e.g. \"2 m\" + \"4 sec\" is an illegal calculation). The main part of the application, however, deals with the graphical display of the calculator and the implementation of special calculation methods (e.g. \"point before line calculation\", \"percentage calculation\" or also \"faculty calculation\"). This application shows very clearly that basic functionality, i.e. the \"general case\", is contained in the model classes, while special requirements, such as \"dot before line calculation\" are implemented with InstantView®.

In addition to these standard units, further user-defined units can be added to the system with this module.

Or you can define new basic units, like \"pallet\", \"bottle\", etc. For the latter, part-specific unit tables are then stored on the parts themselves. The units stored in the system can - as soon as they are based on the same units - be converted directly. If this is not the case, conversion tables must be defined. The ClassiX system provides the above mentioned part-specific unit tables and tables for currency conversion as conversion tables.

        "output": "Table of units: Unit tables define the conversion between different units. In this module unit conversions for parts are given, e.g. \"1 bar\" corresponds to \"6000 mm\". Specific weights/weights are also given in these tables of units (\"1000 mm\" corresponds to \"3.25 kg\"). The units defined here for a part can then be specified at any point in the entire system for this part. A special feature is the variant part with its sub-parts; if the sub-part does not have its own unit table, that of the variant part is used. Any conversions necessary for calculations are automatically carried out by the system using this unit table. Such calculations also arise whenever different units of measure have to be specified in the logistics account of a part for staging (handling unit), planning (purchasing/production unit) and stock management (stock unit). Different units for sales and order prices (€ per \"any\" unit) may also have been specified here, which also require conversion. To cover all the complexity of such unit conversions, unit conversions may be specified as a fixed pair of values, as a formula or as a conditional table. The following rules apply to the conversion: Direct Conversion Indirect conversion Remainders when converting Conversion rates. Direct Conversion: Direct conversion uses exactly one exchange rate to convert one unit to another. The list of exchange rates is run through in sequence and the first exchange rate with which conversion is possible is used. If a conversion is to be possible with several conversion rates, i.e. \"across other units\", indirect conversion should be used. Indirect conversion: In contrast to direct conversion, indirect conversion allows conversion \"across several units\". If, for example, \"15 cans\" are to be converted into \"pallets\", it is not necessary to define a conversion rate between these two units. If there is a conversion rate between \"cans\" and \"boxes\" and between \"boxes\" and \"pallets\", \"cans\" can be converted to \"pallets\" by \"diversion\" via \"boxes\". The length of the conversion path is not important. Remainders when converting: In contrast to the conversion of currencies, there is still a fundamental difference, as the source unit cannot always be exactly converted into the target unit. For example, do the following two conversion rates exist: they represent integer ratios, i.e. the conversion of \"6 cans\" into \"boxes\" does not result in \"1,2 boxes\" but in \"1 box and 1 can\". If the conversion is done indirectly, there can also be several remainders, so that e.g. \"22 cans\" converted into \"pallets\" results in \"1 pallet\" with the remainder \"1 crate and 2 cans\". Classix provides functionality for the management of such remainders in order to be able to display the remainder as the initial unit again, in this example as \"7 cans\". Conversion rates: When defining an exchange rate, four types can be distinguished. These are. Input window: This window is used to maintain unit tables of parts. Examples: In the system a unit package is defined. Now it may happen that in certain cases the unit needs to be specified more precisely (e.g. \"data package\" or \"Christmas package\"). In order not to have to create a completely new unit, data and Christmas packages are both packages, a new designation can be entered in specific cases by means of a unit table. In addition to the designation, you can also enter a quantity (field \"Unit2\"). This means that a \"Christmas package\" does not necessarily have to be a synonym for \"package\", but can also correspond to \"1 kg\". For a \"real\" unit only one overdefined unit can exist. For example, if you define \"data packet\" first, then \"Christmas packet\" in a table of units and register this table, only \"Christmas packet\" (as a unit defined later) is a valid unit. This functionality of redefining units is not fully implemented. For example, in a ListBox, the redefined name is only displayed the first time it is displayed. In addition, the unit names defined in this way are monolingual because this window stores the unit name in the \"uniqueID\" field of the newly created CX_UNIT-RATE object. See also ChangeUnitNames. Conditional unit conversion: The conditional table is useful for variant parts if there must be a conversion that is dependent on a material characteristic. For example, for sheet metal. Sheets are calculated per kilogram in the order and ordered per piece. For these variant parts, the surface dimensions and material thicknesses can be freely set on the order. The different material thicknesses now result in different conversions from dm² to kg. These conversions can be entered in the conditional unit conversion. Example: Example 2 To get from one piece to the weight of the material (depending on dimensions and material), the unit conversion can be even more dynamic: Conversion 1: area in units Type: Formula Value: ValuePer(LENGTH_BROAD_PART*WIDTH_BROAD_PART, 1 piece) Result: dm²/piece Conversion 2: Material thickness in weight Type: Formula value: 7.85 [[kg/l]*STAERKE_ROHTEIL Result: kg/dm² If the attributes LENGTH_BROAD_PART, WIDTH_BROAD_PART and STRENGTH_BROAD_PART are now set in the order at a position with a piece of this sheet, the weight per piece can be determined. To make the calculation also dependent on the material type (different density), the type \"table\" is to be preferred for conversion 2: Type: Table Content: Result: kg/dm² Note that the l in the formula [[kg/l] is a small L and stands for litre, thus replacing dm*dm*dm or also dm³. This is simply clearer in the formula and has the advantage that the system does not search for another conversion from kilogram to dm and possibly end up in an endless loop.

In addition to a user's login information, such as ID and password, access rights can also be defined here.As a rule, it is the \"own\" employees of the clients defined in the system who are users. Being a user therefore means that a person - in addition to his or her role as an employee - has the additional role of user. The registration of a user is therefore in the true sense the registration of a user role.This also makes it possible to assign user roles to contact persons of other companies. Unlike employees, contact persons of other companies do not have an employee role as an employee of a \"system client\", but a contact person role as an employee of another company. This means that these persons can also be given another role as a user of their system. (e.g. their tax advisors or auditors - but also temporary agency workers - who continue to be and remain the contact person of the external company).If such \"external\" users also carry out activities in which, for example, documents are created with input/output of contact data, it makes sense to store this contact data (e-mail, telephone extension number) - purely in the role as user - directly at the user role. Otherwise, there is a risk that the system will take over the contact data of the \"foreign\" contact person role when printing a document or sending an e-mail.Even if, for example, the employees in the sales department are only to be contacted via a collective e-mail (e.g. sales@myCompany.com), this collective e-mail can be stored for each of these users in their user role. In the employee role itself, the actual contact data for internal company traffic can then remain unchanged and unmistakable.In addition to the user role-specific contact data, a user can also be assigned his or her own first place of work.In addition to user roles that can be assigned to a natural person, one occasionally needs user roles that cannot be permanently assigned to a specific person. This is the case, for example, if the system is to be used by \"third parties\", e.g. for anonymous use via an interface (API). For such cases, user roles can also be assigned to companies (legal persons). Whether the assignment is made to one's own company (e.g. for night runs) or to a third-party company (e.g. the operator of the online shop that transmits data) is not relevant here.In principle, it is also possible to create user roles without any assignment to a natural or legal person.

Since a real person should be assigned to the login if possible, it is recommended to first create the personal data in the ClassiX® partner administration. You can also do this later. In general, however, you should keep in mind that 'user' is only the role of one person, and one person may have several roles. If you first create the person and then assign one or more roles to this person, you can avoid double entries and you will always have your data well structured. However, system users do not have to be created as persons at the same time!. List window: Used to list the users. Selection window: This window is used to select a user.

In contrast to the editing window, administrative settings, such as access rights, cannot be changed via this window. Set password: This window allows you to give a password directly to a user. This password can be entered as a temporary or a final password. If a temporary password is assigned, the user must change it to a final password immediately after login. Field Description User: New password Enter the new password. Repeat : Enter the new password again to check that both entries are the same. Set as temporary password This is useful, for example, if a user cannot request a password for himself by e-mail. The administrator can then do this for the user, but the user must change the password immediately after the first login. Single sign-on: Single sign-on (SSO) defines a functionality that is intended to simplify the handling of the large number of logins of the Windows applications used by reducing them to a single login routine. As a Windows logon has always been carried out at the start time of ClassiX®, the ClassiX® single sign-on functionality refers to this.

This time validity window is compared with the validity date specified in the system during each processing with this object. If an object is therefore \"invalid\", it is not displayed in lists by default, for example, or access to data of this object is no longer possible. In the business environment, data in the manner described above are very often limited in time (e.g. customer no longer exists, product is no longer to be sold), but as a rule one piece of information is only replaced by another piece of information that is \"newer\" in time: the value added tax rate is increased from 1.1., a price table changes from a certain date, etc. In these cases it is possible to make a temporal concatenation of information or objects. This is made possible by the \"Exchange objects\" box. This box contains all the objects that are in a logical chronological order; depending on their validity, one object automatically replaces the other. It does not matter which object you are currently standing at, you will always receive the correct information at the right time. Functionality: A validity period can be specified in three different ways: In order to carry out a temporal concatenation of objects, the objects in question must be dragged and dropped into the \"Exchange objects\" box.

In principle, all postings that were posted with a tax key are processed in the advance return for sales tax. (The items of the VAT form are stored in the tax key). In addition, this information can also be stored for a G/L account in order to also be able to consider postings without a tax key in the advance return for VAT. G/L accounts stored as tax accounts are always included in the processing. Entries with a control key are assigned to the fields in the form of the advance return for turnover tax according to the specifications made on the control key. Entries without a control key are only assigned to a field in the form of the advance return for VAT if the G/L account posted to has a corresponding assignment. The following procedure is recommended for setting up the advance return for VAT:Load/set up the form as a structure with identifier VAT_RETURN_REPORT. Setting up the control keys with assignment to the form fields Assignment of such G/L accounts to form fields that could possibly be posted to without a tax key: as a rule, all accounts whose values must be included as the tax base in the advance return for sales tax. Although one can assume that these accounts are always posted to with tax keys, one can build in further security here by assigning the entire account. However, you must be aware that all postings to an account marked in this way, which were posted without a tax key, will then always be assigned to this form field. However, such subsequent allocations are displayed in the list window as a system message and can thus be checked. Check whether all expense and revenue accounts in the G/L account master record are marked as such: otherwise the system could issue messages such as \"Revenue account posted with input tax key Check whether accounts such as import VAT, which are not automatically posted with fixed percentages from gross postings, have been created as accounts of the type tax account. If this is not the case, the account type of the G/L account can be changed subsequently in the list window under the menu item \"Edit\" / \"Change account type\". When the advance return for sales tax is set up, the system automatically checks all postings of the selected period for possible errors or discrepancies. If any occur, they are displayed in the list System messages. Here is a brief overview of the logic of the checks:. List window: The list window contains the totals view with the filled in form fields, a detailed view with the postings of the postings considered in the VAT advance return, a list of the balances of the accounts directly assigned to a field in the VAT advance return form and a list of the discrepancies detected by the system when creating the VAT advance return: these are displayed in the form of error or warning messages. After selecting the period and other options, one starts the evaluation by pressing a button in the toolbar. The system now reads in all bookings of the selected period and assigns them to the corresponding control fields. The status of the processing can be seen in the status bar. At the end of processing, the status line shows how many entries are in the detailed view with the bookings and how many were selected in it. If you switch to the detailed view with the bookings, you can navigate directly to the journal of the financial accounting by double-clicking on an entry in the list. With a right click you can display the total of selected entries.

        "output": "Check database: With this module the database can be technically checked completely or in parts. Besides the connections of the objects among each other, the collections are also checked (call of the ObjectStore utility osverifydb). If no errors are detected, deleted objects can be permanently removed (reorganised) from the database in a second step. For this purpose 6 preparatory steps have to be taken before the database is internally reorganised with the ObjectStore utility oscompact and then created as a new copy with the ObjectStore utility oscopy. If a persistent object is deleted from a ClassiX application, it is first only logically deleted, i.e. a deletion identifier is assigned and the object is registered in a separate list (garbage collection). To permanently remove a persistent object from an object-oriented database it must be ensured that no other object references this deleted object. This check is carried out using the ObjectStore utility osgc, which marks all \"unreachable\" objects as deletable and thus releases them for removal. An object is considered \"unreachable\" if it is not referenced in the database by any other object or list. In order to make objects that have been logically deleted by a ClassiX application \"unreachable\", the following 6 steps have to be carried out: Since logically deleted objects can also reference other logically deleted objects, the connections between these objects are cut. Connections to non-deleted objects, on the other hand, are retained. For this purpose, all logically deleted objects from their registration list (garbage collection) are run through. Deleted\" are those objects that either have a deletion identification or are contained in the deletion registration list (garbage collection). The addresses of the objects from which connections were cut - i.e. which were changed - are saved in a file. All logically deleted objects are removed from their registration list (garbage collection), the addresses of these objects are written to a file. Call of the ObjectStore utility osgc with output of the addresses of the \"unreachable\" objects into a file, i. e. this run does NOT remove any objects from the database. From the addresses from steps 2 and 3, a list of object addresses can now be determined which - although deleted - would not be removed from the database: For this purpose, the addresses that are considered \"unreachable\" (step 3) are removed from the addresses of all logically deleted objects (step 2). The resulting list contains only those addresses of logically deleted objects that must NOT and would NOT be removed from the database, i.e. which are still \"actively\" referenced by other objects in the database. This address list of logically deleted objects remaining in the database is compared with the addresses in the list from step 1: If addresses appear in both lists, connections have been cut, which must remain, otherwise a complete navigation from \"active\" objects would no longer be possible. These objects must be examined more closely: either the deletion is reversed, or the connection to the \"active\" database space is cut, or these objects are omitted in step 1. If such objects occur, it is not possible to proceed directly with the reorganisation of the database. After checking the situation and reacting accordingly, step 1 must be restarted. If such objects do not occur, the actual removal of the objects from the database can be continued with step 5. Call the ObjectStore utility osgc again, but this time WITH removal of \"unreachable\" objects from the database. Using the address list from step 2, the logically deleted objects still remaining in the database are registered again, i.e. entered in the garbage collection. If all these steps are called up in one go, it is checked whether the newly created garbage collection matches the list of remaining objects from step 4. Also for these remaining objects, it should be checked why references from \"active\" objects still exist. Up to this point, objects were initially only deleted from the database. A reorganisation of the data in the database and thus a possible reduction in the size of the database is only achieved by successively calling the ObjectStore utilities oscompact and oscopy.

In addition to the \"Start\" and \"End\" messages - from which the work duration is then determined - standard times can also be reported or the number of employees per workstation can be specified (special entries).The further processing of BDE data takes place in the production data acquisition module.

Overview: The module is a project (.cxp file) which is operated without a database. The \"non-persistent\" ClassiX® DLLs are required for this purpose. The booked data is stored in the file described by the environment variables CX_FLEXTERM_LOGFILE and sent to the computer defined by the environment variables CX_FLEXTERM_HOST for further processing. For this purpose the batch \"sendhost.bat\" is called from the application, which in turn calls the transmission program sendhost.exe, in which the ftp access authorisations are defined. Implementation: The control of the application is essentially controlled by the environment variables:. Module name: flexterm.cxp. Classes: -."

        "output": "World Clock: This module allows to calculate the current time in another location (related to a specific location). Not only different time zones, but also summer and winter time (if available) are taken into account. In addition, it is shown whether and what kind of public holiday takes place at the respective location. Example:: It is chosen as the location \"Hamburg\" and as the comparative location \"Los Angeles\". The time zone difference here is 9 hours. If \"4.7.1996\" is now selected as the date and \"17.00\" as the time, the time difference remains unchanged, as daylight saving time applies in both countries. This means that the clock of the place of comparison shows \"8.00 o'clock\". It also indicates that this day is a public holiday in \"Los Angeles\", namely \"Independence Day\". Selection of a location: When the application is started, the location currently set on the system is determined and transferred to the field for the own location. All available countries are entered in the field for the comparison location. To select another location, open the box and click on another location. Only locations that belong to the same superordinate location are available for selection. If, on the other hand, a subordinate or superordinate location is to be selected, the arrow keys are to be used. If one of the buttons is not available, this means that no superior or subordinate location exists. Example:: Los Angeles\" is to be selected as the reference site. First, open the User Box to display the list of available countries in the comparison location field. Now \"USA\" can be selected. To get to the state level of the USA press the arrow key\"ß\". Opening the box again will list all (available) states of the USA. After selecting \"California\" and pressing\"ß\" again, all counties/cities of California are displayed. From this list, \"Los Angeles\" can now be selected. Exceptional case:: In the case of locations that extend over several time zones (e.g. the USA), the corresponding clock disappears because no time zone is clearly selected. A message indicating this appears in the status bar at the bottom of the window. After selecting a location that is located in only one time zone, the corresponding clock is displayed again. Selection of a time: The application does not necessarily refer to the current time, but makes it possible to specify any time. In this way, questions such as \"If I am in London at 15.00 on 7.9.96, what time is it in New York, and is it a public holiday in one of the two places?\" can be answered. To change the time, simply set a new time in the corresponding fields for the time and date. If you want to set the current time or date again, press the corresponding button. consideration of summer and winter time: The application takes into account the changeover time to summer or winter time at a location. If, for example, the time difference between \"Hamburg\" and \"Los Angeles\" is calculated on \"1.2.96\", it is 9 hours, but on \"1.4.96\" it is 10 hours, since on this day in Germany it has already been changed to daylight saving time (one hour ahead), but not yet in the USA. The time valid at the respective location is displayed (\"summer time\", \"winter time\"). If the time is not changed at that location, this is indicated by \"normal time\". Display of public holidays: For each of the two locations, it is shown whether there is a public holiday at that location at the time shown for that location. World Clock Module: The core of the \"World Clock\" consists of the calculation of the difference between two global dates, i.e. dates that also have a time zone specification. The class CX_GLOBAL_TERM is available for this purpose. When calculating the time difference between two locations, however, an existing summer and winter time should also be taken into account. This information is kept in the location data as a periodic date in form of an object of the class CX_PERIODIC_DATE. This means that the date of the summer time changeover does not have to be specified for each year, but is held as a formula. In Germany, for example, the changeover to summer time is usually made on the \"last Sunday in March\". The exact changeover time for a particular year is returned by the system as an object of class CX_TERM. Of course, the starting point does not have to be the same as your own location. To access data from a specific location, it only needs to be stored in an object of the classes CX_LOCALE, CX_STATE_LOCALE or CX_COUNTRY_LOCALE to allow access. Even a (temporary) exchange of the system location with another location is no problem. In this way it can be determined whether a holiday is taking place at the comparison location. Module name: wrldclck.mod. Classes: CX_LOCALE CX_STATE_LOCALE CX_COUNTRY_LOCALE CX_TERM and CX_GLOBAL_TERMCX_PERIODIC_DATE."
