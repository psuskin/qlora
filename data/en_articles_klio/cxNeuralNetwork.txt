This is the description of the module "cxNeuralNetwork" with the name "Neural network parameters": This app is used to set the parameters of a neural network. Some parameters can/must be set directly when creating a new neural network, others can be adjusted during training. Therefore, the editing window is divided into a "Setup Parameters" window and a "Training Parameters" window.However, the first fixed setting is always a distinction between a "Regression" or a "Classifying" neural network, so this setting must be made first. Once created, this specification and the "Setup Parameters" can no longer be changed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxNeuralNetwork" with the name "Neural network parameters" regarding Network: In this window all parameters of a neural network can be defined and maintained.
