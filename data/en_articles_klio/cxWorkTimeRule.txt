This is the description of the module "cxWorkTimeRule" with the name "Flexitime rule": The flexitime rules are available for evaluating the recorded working times. These can be structured differently for different employee groups. For example, an industrial employee may not clock in outside the working time assigned to him, although an employee may.The recording of sick days can also vary: If an employee is only paid by the hour, he or she does not receive a wage for this period. However, if he is an employee, the day is paid.These rules are laid down in the flexitime rules.Technical description:The floating time events write certain bit patterns into the evaluation. These bit patterns are evaluated by these rules and an action number is generated. This action number is then translated into various reactions in the programme code.The possible reactions of the system are the following:Overtime before or after working hours: Recorded time is outside working hours. If it is earlier than normal working time, it is only counted at weekends; on weekdays a message appears. If it is overtime after the end of working time, it is always counted, but on working days an additional notification message is displayed.Recorded working time is within the normal flexitime and is counted as normal working time. (e.g. employee has come within the flexitime but outside the standard working time)Recorded absence lies within the core working time. Only one warning message is issuedRecorded time is normal working time and is also counted as such (like point 2, only within working time instead of flexitime!) (e.g. employee came during working time but outside of break)DiseaseHolidayOn business trips (working time will be credited as normal)Present during a break (working time is NOT counted)Fixed working time (reaction still unclear)Overtime before or after working hours: Recorded time is outside working hours. If it is earlier than normal working time, it is only counted at weekends; on weekdays a message appears. If it is overtime after the end of working time, it is always counted, but in contrast to point 1, an additional message is always displayedPensioners and cleaning staff: working time is always fully countedAdditional days off.Additional planning functionality of the rulesSince the flexitime rules assume that a working time has already been recorded, without a pure planning rule it is not possible to determine in advance how much working time an employee will have to work on Wednesday of the following week. There is an extra rule for this which assumes that no time records have yet been made and only assumes the planned time.This rule can either be specified directly on the employee if he does not stamp, i.e. has fixed working times, or on another rule as a "capacity planning rule".When determining the planned working time, the planning rule is always used if it has been specified. If this link is missing, 0min remaining available capacity is used in planning.Technical description of the evaluationFirst, the evaluation takes the time period to be evaluated and runs through all days individually.For each day, all booked receipts per employee are first collected and the recorded events "coming" (firstComingTime) and "going" (lastGoingTime) are stored in a dailyContainer.The posted events are run through together with the working time events and the action of the latter is always carried out, whereby an action as described above is then determined via the rule.Example In this example, you can see how the working times behave mixed with the posted receipts. The employee has booked an "Arrives" and a "Leaves" receipt. The remaining entries are events from the master data of the working time description. The action is the result of the rule determined from the bit patterns above. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxWorkTimeRule" with the name "Flexitime rule" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain flexitime rules. You can select a flextime rule by entering the required number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search".
