This is the description of the module "cxWorkTimeRule" with the name "Working time accounting rule": The recorded working times are processed by means of the working time accounting rules. These can be structured differently for different employee groups. For example, it can be controlled that an industrial employee is not allowed to clock in outside the working time assigned to him (working time is not taken into account, a message is issued), but a salaried employee is not prohibited from doing so.The recording of sick days can also be different: If an employee is only paid by the hour, he or she does not receive a wage for this period; in the case of a salaried employee, the day is paid in full.This different behaviour is specified in the payroll rules. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxWorkTimeRule" with the name "Working time accounting rule" regarding Rule numbers: Some working time events such as coming/going/sick etc. set and/or delete certain bits of a 32-digit bit pattern, i.e. at each point in time within a day, the status of an employee is described in terms of his or her time availability. This status (this bit pattern) is re-evaluated with each new event and the number of a rule is determined in the process. These fixed rule numbers are translated directly into programme code by the system. The following rules are permanently defined: Additional planning functionality of the rules Since the payroll rules assume that a working time has already been recorded, it is not possible without a pure planning rule to determine in advance how much working time will accrue for an employee e.g. in the next week Wednesday. There is a separate extra rule for this, which assumes that no time has yet been recorded and only assumes the planned time. This rule can either be specified directly on the employee if he does not stamp, i.e. has fixed working times, or on another rule as a "capacity planning rule". When determining the planned working time, the planning rule is always used if it has been specified. If this link is missing, 0min remaining available capacity is used in planning. Technical description of the evaluation First, the evaluation determines the period to be evaluated and runs through all days individually within this period. For each day, all booked receipts (booked working and absence times) are collected and the recorded events "comes" (firstComingTime) and goes (lastGoingTime) are saved in a container (dailyContainer). These booked events are then brought together with the events from the respective working time model, resulting in a specific state at each time. These states are run through individually and evaluated by means of the accounting rules. If a number of a rule results, the corresponding processing is run through in the programme. Example In this example, you can see how the working times behave mixed with the posted receipts. The employee has booked an "Arrives" and a "Leaves" receipt. The remaining entries are events from the master data of the working time description. The action is the result of the rule determined from the bit patterns above.
