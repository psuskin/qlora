This is the description of the module "sessiond" with the name "Date of meeting": Session and validity date are automatically set to the (system) date of the computer when the programme is started. This (system) date is also used to automatically determine the started period of a business year closest to this date and register for the session. If the ClassiX速 system automatically offers a date in the entry masks, it is the session date set in this way and not the (system) date of the computer. Changing the session date is useful if you want to enter data into the ClassiX速 system in advance or subsequently and you do not want to keep changing the "current" date offered automatically by the system to the date you want. The validity date determines the time validity of objects. The functionality of accessing only valid objects can be switched off system-wide in this module if desired or set to a specific date - even different from the session date (generates warning message!) . Fiscal year, period and session date are displayed in the bottom bar of the ClassiX速 main screen. If the validity by date is switched off or the validity date is different from the session date, this is also displayed in the bottom bar of the ClassiX速 main screen. This is the description of the functionality of the module "sessiond" with the name "Date of meeting" regarding Functionality: In the input window, you can change the session date and disable the validity or set a validity date.
