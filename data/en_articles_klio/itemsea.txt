This is the description of the module "itemsea" with the name "Search for parts (logistic)": This window is used to search for parts based on various logistical criteria or filters easily visible in the window. Normally this window is called up by another window, i.e. function, searches for a certain parts list and passes it back to the outgoing window. There the transferred parts list can be filtered again!. This is the description of the functionality of the module "itemsea" with the name "Search for parts (logistic)" regarding Functionality: The search for parts can be restricted using the input fields shown. It is possible to enter several part numbers - separated by commas - in the "Part number from" field. E.g. 524370, 524273, 524376, but the "part number to" must then remain empty or will not be taken into account! If no filter criterion is entered, the entire part master is returned. Special filters: In the list of staging types, a red'yes' is displayed in the second column for some entries in the list of staging types that lead to a warehouse reservation. In order to be able to find parts that are currently not assigned to a stock-reserving staging type (such as "MRP" or "JIT"), but which nevertheless have current "extra" stock reservations due to e.g. overhangs, you can include these parts in the search using the option "Parts with extra stock reservations: additional search". If available, the filter "Logistik KZ", "Teile von to" and "MRP Processor" are applied to these extra warehouse reservations! As this additional search option can take a long time, it is deactivated by default, i.e. the option "Parts with extra stock reservations: do not search additionally" is automatically preset. It is also possible to list all parts with extra warehouse reservations that are not assigned to a warehouse reserving staging type: Option "Parts with extra stock reservations: search only stock reservations".
