This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_deliveryauditing" with the name "Delivery Auditing" regarding Example of an evaluation of the delivery audit: The system by which the customer's creditworthiness is assessed is not specified by ClassiX, but can be defined individually. The following rule for the rating is therefore only an example. In determining the quality of delivery, weighted key figures are determined in percentage points. The sum of the percentage points can add up to a maximum of 100, so a customer with a value of 100 is a customer with a very good credit rating. In addition, there are also summarised key figures, which result directly from the invoice/credit note.
