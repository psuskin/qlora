This is the description of the module "qm_picture_qm" with the name "Image processing": This test tries to find errors in the processing of images. After starting, the user is prompted to specify an image file. This image is then displayed in 3 different modes, once the original, then dynamically positioned and stretched. A click on the button 'Original Image' asks the user to select an image file again.
