This is the description of the module "genproce" with the name "Module Generator for documents without positions": The business object Module Generator creates AppsWarehouseÂ® modules based on templates (*.gen). The following structure is generated.Module generator for documents without itemsThe module generator for documents without items generates four AppsWH modules, a workflow load file, a transaction description load file and extends the EXT and MSG.Instructions for creating a new document without items Generation of the modules/files via the module generator.Extending EditWin by the data fields that are necessary for the description of the document. After this has been done, the SetListBox macro should be adjusted immediately afterwards.Adapting the generated workflow and the generated transaction description to the requirements of the document.If the document should have relevant data fields, which are to be preset by a company role or, for example, a client, the DefaultTransactionWin in the corresponding group must be extended by these data fields. It is important here that the slots used are identical to those in EditWin.A bitmap (with grey and white background) has to be created for the document and in ivFunction.mod the case instruction of the macros G_GetPicture and G_ObjectDescription has to be extended by the new class.In order to use the generated print module it is necessary to create a print document.The ID of this document should be a three-digit letter abbreviation of the class.The document must be assigned to a type or an area (e.g. purchasing, sales, financial accounting, warehouse, etc.).In the INITIALIZE of the print module the variables defaultDocumentID and documentArea should be initialized with the data just defined.The SetWinTitleStart macro must be supplemented by a more appropriate window title. Ex: Create a first draft document: (IN A TEST DATABASE) Inserting the general header and footer into the documentInsert an existing document header into the document, which should be similar in layout to the future document. (Actually, all documents leaving the company should look very similar to each other).This document module must have a new ID and should be given its own name.If the newly created document is now exported and loaded into a new (test) database, the previously used module is not overwritten due to the new ID and the document can now be adapted.The following templates are used ./AppsWH/process.gen - (basic module)./AppsWH/proceedt.gen - (editing module)./AppsWH/procesel.gen - (selection module)./AppsWH/proceprn.gen - (print module)./AppsWH/data/txn-wf/DEFAULT_WORKFLOW.gen - (Workflow)./AppsWH/data/txn-wf/DEFUALT_TRANSACTION_DESCRIPTION.gen - (transaction description)StructureModuleMacrosMessagesWindowBasic module (examp.mod)MacroDescriptionInitCounterThe counter for the class is searched for, if not found one is created.SetListBoxSetFormat instructions for the ListBoxListObjectsFind all objects of the defined classPickObject sentreceivedEDIT_XXXXXXXX_CREATED XXXX_CHANGED XXXX_DELETEDSelectWinOptionsWinEditing module (exampedt.mod)MacroDescriptionSetOptionsUsed to initialise the module with regard to the options and is called up accordingly in the INITIALIZE of the module.CreateSymbolServes to create bitmapsInitBitmapsIn this module, the bitmaps used are created and assigned to variables.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "genproce" with the name "Module Generator for documents without positions" regarding Input window: After the basic module has been entered, the file names of the editing and selection module are automatically suggested. However, the suggested file names are not binding and can be changed. for example: basic module: customer / system Automatically suggested file names: It is strongly recommended to use the suggested file names to ensure consistency and clarity. The pattern indicates the template according to which the module is created. When a class is selected, the message name and variable name are automatically suggested as described for file names. for example: Class: CX_CUSTOMER Messages: EDIT_CUSTOMER, LIST_CUSTOMER, , CUSTOMER_CREATED, etc. Variable name: customer Again, the recommendation to adopt the proposals for the reasons set out above.
