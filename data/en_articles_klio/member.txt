This is the description of the module "member" with the name "Member - Dynamic data fields": With this application you can create, persist and then maintain members. One must be aware that only persistent members can and should be changed. Therefore you have to make created, first transient, members persistent at runtime, only then you are allowed to change them. Transient members of the ClassiXÂ® system, i.e. members that are loaded from the *.DIC and *.INI files when the system is started, may neither be changed nor made persistent. Once created and made persistent, members can no longer be deleted. Once created and made transient members cannot be deleted either, but they will no longer be present when the system is next booted. Making members persistent only works from the list window, this is a security measure. For example, if you have created several transient members and you don't want to keep one of them, you can make the members you want to keep persistent, restart the system and then only the persisted members will be available. The created transient member will no longer be displayed.
