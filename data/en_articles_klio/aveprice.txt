This is the description of the functionality of the module "aveprice" with the name "Average price calculation" regarding Definition: The average price is stored in the warehouse account of the respective part as price per quantity (for display, see logistics account) and is continuously updated. The calculation rules are not defined in the program code, but in the database by the transaction descriptions for corresponding stock-related documents. As calculation basis the roll price of the part (production part/order item) or the price of the document can be used. This setting can be made under the client, see. In both cases the average price is in the logistics account, but it is calculated on a different basis. On each document the current price iswritten offfrom the document "pricePer" and from the role"last.defaultPricePer". You can check the existing average prices of the stocked parts in the menu "Services --> Materials management" in the index card "Stock account". See Currently the following standard scheme is used: Whenever the average price is changed, the date of the change is also saved in the warehouse account. This is the description of the functionality of the module "aveprice" with the name "Average price calculation" regarding Invoice: The average price is adjusted with each purchase of material as follows: The value for the access price is taken from the slot pricePer (= document price) or last.defaultPricePer (=roll price) depending on the setting in the client. ( old stock * old average price + receipt quantity * receipt price ) / ( old stock + receipt quantity ) ==> new average price Average price is adjusted with each physical inventory document as follows old average price = average.pricePer valuation price = pricePer ( old stock * old average price + counted quantity * valuation price - target quantity * average price ) / ( old stock + counted quantity - target quantity ) ==> new average price The new average price is then rounded to the number of decimal places specified in the system (e.g. for Euro = 2 decimal places) and standardised to the previous per-factor (see examples below). At the same time, this calculation scheme ensures that the respective warehouse account is correct at all times (see also special case 3 below): ( initial stock value + total of all receipts - total of all issues ) / (initial stock + total of all receipts - total of all issues ) = average price Special cases:.
