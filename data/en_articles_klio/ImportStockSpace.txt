This is the description of the module "ImportStockSpace" with the name "Import of storage places": This window is used to import storage bins. With the button "Excel Template" an Excel file with all column headings can be created and processed. The headings must be exactly as they appear in the file. Other headings will not be processed. Not all headings need to be present and the order is arbitrary. The column "Storage bin" and, if no warehouse was selected, the column "Warehouse" must be included. If the required columns are missing, no processing takes place. When the import file is processed, an additional column "Error/ERROR" is appended to the right end of the column. In this column is documented if an error has occurred. If the error is that no warehouse or storage bin is found in this line, the line is not processed further. Fields Field Description : Warehouse In this DropDownBox you can select the warehouse in which the storage locations are to be created. If the import was started from a warehouse, this warehouse is preselected and the drop-down box cannot be changed. If the DropDownBox is filled and the column "Stock" is present, only the rows that point to the same stock are processed. If the DropDownBox is filled and the column "Stock" is not available, all rows are processed. The DropDownBox does not have to be filled with a warehouse, but then it is expected that a column "warehouse" exists and is filled in the read in file. : Create non-existing storage locations! If this checkbox is active, storage bins which are not found in the selected warehouse are created automatically. Non-existing warehouses will not be created!
