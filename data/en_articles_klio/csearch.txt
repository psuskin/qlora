This is the description of the module "csearch" with the name "Companies and persons search": When a search term is entered, the system searches in the search terms specially created for the companies/persons. These can be freely selected. The search is inaccurate by default. This means that if only the first part of a word is entered, the system will search for data beginning with that part of the word. In addition, the machine allows the user to work with wildcards. If the entered search term starts with an asterisk followed by a word, the system searches all data that has this entered word anywhere in the search term. The question mark stands for exactly one character, which is unknown, in contrast to the asterisk, where it does not matter how many characters follow or precede. The question mark can therefore be placed anywhere in the word. Examples of this: Search Keyword returns all data whose search term Meyer* start with Meyer *Meyer end with Meyer Meyer*Schulze start with Meyer and end with Schulze Me?er is 5 letters long, the first two "Me", the last two "he" and the 3rd letter is unknown The company/person search displays its search results in a table containing further information on the records found. All companies or persons are displayed, regardless of whether this company was created as a customer or whether it was first created as a company and subsequently assigned the role customer. On the right side you will find the roles of the selected company/person and their contact details. The following still applies to the company search: In the list, a small symbol next to the name indicates that the company is either a main company which still has subcontractors, or that the company is a branch of another main company. If none of these symbols are present, there is no attached main company or branch. If there is any relationship between the displayed company and another company, the symbol for affiliated companies appears in the list .
