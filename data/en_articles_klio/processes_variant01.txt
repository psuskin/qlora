This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_variant01" with the name "Variant parts" regarding Variant parts: In ClassiX® a variant part is a description for an actually occurring part, a pattern for a distinct part. This description includes - as for any other part - an identifying number, a description, various details, such as logistic and dispositive identification, etc. However, a variant part is also described by means of a list of characteristics. This list of characteristics defines the characteristics or quantities whose different values or characteristics can be used for an actual part. {img type="fileId" fileId="320" thumb="box" width="100%"} If you give a value for the length and a value for the width of our sheet metal with the number 4711, then such a part is described completely exactly. Although only one (variant) part is specified ("sheet 4711"), by additionally specifying the values of the characteristics, it is possible to describe different characteristics of one and the same variant part and thus define different, exactly described parts. A variant part can thus be used like any other part in the system, with the difference that all values for characteristics in the characteristics list must always be specified. The advantage now is that a variant part only has to be defined once in the system, only once as master information in the part master. Nevertheless, a large number of different versions of this variant part are available for further processing in the DP system. If you need sheet metal 4711 in length=100mm and width=50mm, but at another time you need the same sheet metal in length=30mm and width=12mm, you have to enter values for length and width, but you always use the other information of the variant part already stored in the system. In principle, the characteristics of a variant part - as in our example of the sheet metal - can take any value, but valid value ranges can be assigned to the characteristics or attributes. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_variant01" with the name "Variant parts" regarding Lower and individual parts: As we have seen, variant parts make particular sense when you are dealing with "equal" parts of the most varied characteristics/dimensions/performance. However, if some characteristics (keyword "standard sizes") of a variant part are used very often, it makes sense to store them as independent parts in the part master. A subpart must hold all attributes of the characteristics bar. Assuming that the two sheets of type 4711 with the dimensions 100/50 and 50/40 are frequently required, they are created in the parts master and assigned to the variant part as so-called lower parts. These subparts can also have the same part number as the variant part, but they must each have different values for the attributes length and width. As a rule of thumb, a variant part should always be created as a subpart in the system if it is kept in the warehouse. In ClassiX®, parts in the part master, which are neither variants nor subparts, are called individual parts. Individual parts can also be specified more precisely via their attributes, but these attributes are only for information purposes. {img type="fileId" fileId="322" thumb="box" width="100%"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_variant01" with the name "Variant parts" regarding Specifications: Specifications are automatically generated by the system if variant parts for which there is no distinct lower part are to be booked into the warehouse as surplus or remaining quantity. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_variant01" with the name "Variant parts" regarding Part Rolls: Like all other parts in ClassiX®, variant parts can also have different rolls. Specifications as purchase part are described and stored in the purchase role, prices for sale in the sales role, etc. Subparts always also use the role information of the variant part assigned to them, unless they themselves have such a role object. In our example the part 4711/length=50mm and width=40mm has its own purchase role, but uses the sales role of the assigned variant part. {img type="fileId" fileId="324" thumb="box" width="100%"}.
