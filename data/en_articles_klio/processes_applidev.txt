This is the description of the module "processes_applidev" with the name "Data and applications": ClassiX® is supplied with a wide range of functions as standard. In this respect ClassiX® does not differ from other ERP products on the market.While other standard products try to provide as much functionality as possible (the "union" of all wishes once expressed by customers), the functionality of ClassiX® applications represents the "intersection" of all possible customer wishes or expectations: only the "lean" functionality is included as standard, a functionality that is really needed by all customers.The ClassiX® Standard was developed conceptually and technologically in such a way that customers should and must be able to make individual deviations from the standard at any time, without endangering the version security of the applications. Each customer should only find what he really needs in his application. No more, but also no less.All adaptations can and should also be carried out on site by our customers and their "super users" themselves. The functionality of an application is determined by the user, not the programme supplier.To ensure this, the following requirements must be met by a system: Redefinition and creation of data fields, relations, data lists in the running system without reorganisation runs Version-safe customer individual overwriting of standardised program code Version-secure new insertion of customers of individual data entities and applications in the running system without reorganisation runs Rule-based system for posting business documents (workflow management and account assignment) stored in the database Rule stored in the database for controlling business processes All these requirements are met by the ClassiX® system. The flexibility of the ClassiX® system is of fundamental importance, especially in view of the constant process of change and adaptation of a company to its own market position. The ClassiX® system changes in the same way as the company where ClassiX® is used.A decisive advantage, therefore, for a permanent increase in the efficiency of your own organisational processes.
