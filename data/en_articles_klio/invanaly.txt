This is the description of the module "invanaly" with the name "Inventory analysis": With this module, inventories are analysed in order to be able to draw conclusions about the quality of inventory accounting from completed inventories in the past, on the one hand, and to be able to check first of all whether the scope of the counting of inventories can be reduced by means of inventory sampling procedures, on the other. If a warehouse is suitable for inventory sampling, the samples can be drawn and checked from this module. This is the description of the functionality of the module "invanaly" with the name "Inventory analysis" regarding Inventory analysis: In this window, you can compile inventory items of one or more physical inventory documents into a common list for the purpose of an analysis or for carrying out inventory sampling. The reason for wanting to combine different inventories - i.e. inventory documents - is that instead of creating only one inventory/one inventory document with all storage bins, it can also make sense to create several inventory documents subdivided according to different storage bin areas. In the latter case, the inventory of another storage bin area that has already been counted can be recorded and posted during the inventory in one storage bin area and this storage bin area can be released again.
