This is the description of the module "securityExam" with the name "Security and performance": Combination Clustering in the database Combination We have the security objects: S0,S1, S2 and X0. S0 makes a statement for all objects of a class or derived classes. S1 describes a deviating statement for a certain derived class and S2 only for a very specific object. X0 describes all other cases - i.e. for the objects of other classes. You can put the objects together in a security set as follows Set = { S2,S1, S0, X0} and receives the desired behaviour. One alternative is: Set = { S0, X0} | specializations | S1 | specializations | S2 The result is the same, but for the access to an object for which X0 makes a statement, 2 superfluous tests are now saved. Clustering in the database Security objects are constantly read, very rarely written. Therefore it makes sense: to assign a separate segment for CX_SECURITY_SET assign all other security objects as slave objects to it. Thus the active Security Objects are most likely to be located closely together on only a few pages.
