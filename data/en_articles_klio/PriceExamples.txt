This is the description of the functionality of the module "PriceExamples" with the name "Examples for the design of the more complex prices" regarding 1. price as formula: Example 1.1: Base price plus a surcharge that depends directly on the cable length: Price formula is assembled as follows: Step A: The formula could simply be written down in ClassiX® syntax like this: Step B: However, we have to keep in mind that cableLength is used in a specific unit of length; to make a price factor out of the length specification, we should extend the formula like this, for example: Step C: The price we compile in this way is still a "simple" price, however; prices in ClassiX® are basically expressed as price-per-value; the formula must therefore be further expanded (according to the item base unit), e.g. like this: Step D: This expression assumes that the characteristic cableLength is always defined; if the sales item has the characteristic, then the value is always known. If this is not the case and the attribute is also allowed to be missing, then another security query would be built in, such as:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "PriceExamples" with the name "Examples for the design of the more complex prices" regarding 2. price as conditional table: Example 2.1: Volume graduation: PRICE = 449,00 €, from 10 pieces 439,00 €, from 20 pieces 420,00 € The price is created as a conditional table and the data is entered as follows: In the third line there need not be a condition, because the price determination in the table runs from top to bottom; so if the quantity is not less than 20 pieces, the third price is used (empty condition = always true) For better readability, a column "quantity" can be defined in the table; then the table looks like this.
