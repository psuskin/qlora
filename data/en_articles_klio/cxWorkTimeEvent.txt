This is the description of the module "cxWorkTimeEvent" with the name "Event (time management)": Time management events are occurrences that have an influence on the stamped/recorded total working time (flexitime, recording of hours) and/or on an employee's absence within a working day. These are, for example, the usual "coming" and "going" events, as well as the start and end of breaks, doctor's visits, full-day absences due to illness, unpaid private absences etc.Such events are assigned directly when "stamping" the attendance and absence times, when recording an employee's absences and when storing the working time models.Via the action on the event, certain switches are set for this event, which in turn are evaluated by the integrated control system .For example, in the case of a blue-collar worker, a warning is given if he stamps before the start of his working time, whereas this does not lead to a warning in the case of a "normal" employee. These rules only concern the evaluation of booked working hours.
