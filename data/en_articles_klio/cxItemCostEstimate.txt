This is the description of the module "cxItemCostEstimate" with the name "Parts preliminary calculation": Capture of characteristics (optional) Recording cost rates (optional) Select part(s) Calculate Error log Edit Resolved Resources (optional) Transferring the calculation values into the master data Possibly new calculation with changed settings This module is used for the pre-calculation of parts from the parts master. The main screen - from which the preliminary costing is carried out - has three windows/cards: the card with the list of parts to be calculated (parts), a card with attributes (attributes) and a card with cost rates (cost rates). The general procedure of a parts pre-calculation is the following: 0a. Capture physical characteristics (optional) Since a preliminary cost estimate can also be made using variant parts, you can store characteristic values in the Characteristics window in advance: this prevents the interactive query of characteristics during the explosion of the BOMs and routings. This is one way of storing characteristic values. Another is that each preliminary cost estimate can have its own characteristic values, which is described below. Characteristic features can be transferred from the master data (part + production role) by clicking on the "Transfer" button above the list of characteristic features. 0b. Recording cost rates (optional) The cost rates in the form of overhead rates for materials, wages, sales and administration are copied by default from the corresponding deposits with the client into the Cost Rates window. These values can be overwritten here. Here, too, each preliminary calculation saves the cost rates for itself and these can be overwritten there. This is also explained in more detail below. 1. select part(s) Here you have the choice between a simple selection by number/text, etc. or via further more complex search criteria, such as warehouse, logistics indicator, etc.". Only parts that have a production role can be selected for a preliminary costing: the parts list and the routing of a part are defined in the production role. A new preliminary cost estimate is automatically created for each newly selected part. This preliminary cost estimate is given its own number and is stored with the production role of the part. Any existing characteristics from the Characteristics window and the cost rates from the Cost Rates window are also copied into the preliminary cost estimate. In addition, you can insert or change characteristics manually, for example, if none have been specified in the main window or if they are insufficient. Just as in the main window, there are two ways of inserting here: A lot size is also copied into the preliminary calculation: This depends on the "Lot size" option, according to which the lot size is copied from the production roll or from a manual specification. It is also possible to draw results of the sales item turnover statistics into the parts pre-calculation list. In the sales article sales statistics, it is possible, for example, to display all spare parts with a positive sales volume in the current statistics period and to start the preliminary calculation for these parts only. 2. calculate The (or all) parts selected in the list can then be pre-calculated. You can choose between a calculation according to standard values (only the characteristics and cost rates from the pre-calculation windows are taken into account) or an individual calculation: the values from the saved pre-calculation are taken. If neither the values in the preliminary costing nor the values in the windows have been changed after selecting a part, both procedures are of course identical. During costing, the parts list(s) and routings are exploded according to the specifications under Option/Stage. The respective status of an explosion is displayed in the status line of the precalculation window. At the end of a cost estimate, the new values for material and labour (per lot size) and thus the manufacturing costs (per 1 unit) are displayed. 3. error log Possible errors in the explosion of the bills of material and routings, as well as missing valuations, lead to an incorrect preliminary costing. An error log can therefore optionally be output on the screen or written to a file. The following error causes are checked: If a preliminary cost estimate has one or more errors, this data cannot be transferred to the production role of the part as new production costs. 4. edit resolved resources (optional) The resulting bill of material and the exploded routing can be viewed. On the one hand as a structure tree, on the other hand in a tabular form with exact display of the costs and overhead rates. 5. transfer the costing values to the master data. The new(error-free) preliminary costing values are transferred with date to the production role of the part. 6. possibly new costing with changed settings. So that you do not have to fill in a complete preliminary part costing again, for example, inserting material characteristics again and defining them accordingly, possibly even inserting the cost rates or documents, you can copy an already existing preliminary part costing from the list window. This can be done either via the main menu of the list window or via the context menu in the list. The description, lot size, characteristics including features, cost rates and documents (no conditional ones) are copied. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemCostEstimate" with the name "Parts preliminary calculation" regarding List window: On the 'Parts' card, the preliminary costings that are currently being processed are listed. On the 'Characteristics' card of the part costing, you can insert or delete the characteristics which are necessary for exploding the BOMs and routings. The global cost rates from the client are displayed on the 'Cost rates' card and can be changed locally. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemCostEstimate" with the name "Parts preliminary calculation" regarding Option window: Each time the main list window is opened, the options described here are reset to the default settings. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemCostEstimate" with the name "Parts preliminary calculation" regarding Input window: In this window data of a preliminary calculation can be edited and completed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemCostEstimate" with the name "Parts preliminary calculation" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select a part preliminary costing. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemCostEstimate" with the name "Parts preliminary calculation" regarding Takeover in production role: The preliminary costing can be transferred to the parts roll. This can only be done once. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemCostEstimate" with the name "Parts preliminary calculation" regarding Error window: In this window, the error messages of the selected preliminary costing are displayed. Double-clicking on an entry opens the preliminary calculation sheet and the corresponding item is marked. This makes it even easier to identify and correct errors (through manual pricing, etc.). This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemCostEstimate" with the name "Parts preliminary calculation" regarding Sequence of events Parts Preliminary costing: Macro ComputeCostEstimate The actual calculations happen in the NewPricePerPiece macro, which in turn calls the Costs macro (see above): updateMode = TRUE à SumUpCosts Depending on the call, material.costs or wages.costs are written where determined per entry. Variable totalCosts contains the total costs per type (material/wages). The total value - incl. the values of the subparts - remains on the stack, converted per lot size. If anything has been changed, everything can be recalculated via "Update calculation" using NewPricePerPiece with updateMode == TRUE. updateMode = FALSE à SumUpImputedCosts The costs already stored in the individual resolved items are added up. Transfer In CX_PRODUCT write away imputed.date in CX_ITEM_COST_ESTIMATE::transferred.date.
