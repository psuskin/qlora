This is the description of the module "opitdbac" with the name "Open items account customers": The documentation compiled here for staff OPs is a specialisation of the general documentation on open items. If there are still open down payment requests for the customer or if down payments have been made by the customer, these documents are displayed in a separate list in the upper part of the screen. From the OR window you can also go directly from the OR window to the customer master data via the corresponding icons or view the journal entry belonging to the OR. You can also print the displayed ORs or transfer them to the reminder window. Afterwards you simply return to the open OR window. This is the description of the functionality of the module "opitdbac" with the name "Open items account customers" regarding List window: This window is used to list and edit the open items and - if available - also the current down payments of a customer. This is the description of the functionality of the module "opitdbac" with the name "Open items account customers" regarding Care Coupling OPs: In this window the coupling of OPs can be edited. The surgery that has triggered an operation is displayed as the primary surgery and is therefore the first and only one displayed in the surgery list. All other OPs - coupled with this OP - are not displayed, but contribute to the total balance of the OP. (In the OR list, you can optionally set to also display the linked ORs). If you want another OR to be displayed as the primary OR, you can select it as the primary OR by double-clicking on it in the lower part of the window ("Coupled open items").
