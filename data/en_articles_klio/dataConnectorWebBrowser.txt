This is the description of the module "dataConnectorWebBrowser" with the name "CyberEnterprise Browser": With the CyberEnterprise® browser one searches in the (static) CyberEnterprise® enterprise model for (static) business objects, their data fields, the C++ classes and pseudo-classes available in the system as a whole, the slots (dynamic data fields), etc. From each (static) business object one can navigate to other (static) business objects, i.e. one can directly navigate to all references available in the enterprise model and find out about their data fields.One thus obtains a complete overview of the (static) CyberEnterprise® enterprise model.Internally in the system, the (static) business objects are mapped as so-called data connectors, which in turn refer to metaclasses of information.The (dynamic) business objects stored in the database are the digital twins of real objects and can be navigated through from the CyberEnterprise Inspector using the object browser or edited and listed using their special editing and list apps. This is the description of the functionality of the module "dataConnectorWebBrowser" with the name "CyberEnterprise Browser" regarding CyberEnterprise® Browser: This window consists of a search mask for the business objects of interest, the graphical output of the interconnectedness of business objects and a list of all data fields of the selected business objects. The search for business objects is carried out via natural language and can be restricted with type filters. Type filters refer to the type of a business object, e.g. a "customer" is a partner function object, an "invoice" is a document object. The selected business objects of the CyberEnterprise® enterprise model can also be output as a graph. The nodes in this graph are the data connectors and the edges correspond to the data fields. Only data fields that actually refer to a data connector are displayed. If a connection between two data connectors is a relation with a back reference, an arrowhead is shown on both sides, otherwise only along the reference. If a data field corresponds to a collection type, this is indicated by a small symbol at the beginning of the arrow. Thus it is possible to virtually run through the entire CyberEnterprise® enterprise model. If only one business object is selected in the list of displayed business objects, then the graph is displayed starting from only this business object. If several or no business objects are selected in the list, then the graph is only displayed with these business objects, the listed business objects serve quasi as filters for the display of the graph.
