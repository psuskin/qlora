This is the description of the module "solutions_pythia" with the name "PYTHIA - Sanctions list check": Protect yourself and your business from embargo violations. Automatically check all your contacts against EU, US and other countries' sanctions lists.With PYTHIA, business partners (companies and individuals) can be checked against the sanctions lists published by the EU, UK, CH, USA and UN. This can be done in two different ways - or in combination with each other:Mass upload of business partners into a separate database (manually or via API), mass or individual matching (manually or via API) and manual maintenance of white and black lists in PYTHIA.Individual matching via API. The API can be easily integrated into other applications to perform immediate queries.PYTHIA keeps all sanctions lists up-to-date on a daily basis.If matches are found during the matching process, these are logged, stored in a list of all hits and can be transferred to a blacklist or a whitelist after manual checking. Persons, companies or one-time addresses that are transferred to a blacklist can be automatically blocked in the host system for any business use.At the end, each logged comparison should be processed so that all hits are listed either in the blacklist or whitelist. Hits already known from the whitelist are only automatically transferred back to a checklist to be checked if something has changed in the sanctions lists in this regard.To obtain an initial overview, you can carry out a mass comparison without a log. This is the description of the functionality of the module "solutions_pythia" with the name "PYTHIA - Sanctions list check" regarding Main window: {img type="fileId" fileId="559" thumb="box" width="350"} The sanctions list monitor has been directly integrated into the main window. This gives you direct access to current hits and allows you to manage your lists (black/white/check). In the lower area, companies and persons can be imported manually and compared with existing ones. This import updates existing entries and adds new entries. After the import, you can list all entries that were not part of the last import in order to set them to invalid, for example, via "Menu to app".
