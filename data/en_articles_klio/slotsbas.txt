This is the description of the module "slotsbas" with the name "Dynamic data fields (slots)": With this application you can create dynamic data fields (slots), make them persistent and then maintain them. It is also possible to display the objects that use a particular dynamic data field from this module (see menu item "Usage"). One must be aware that only persistent slots can and may be changed. That is why slots created at runtime, first transient ones, must be made persistent before they can be changed. Transient slots of the ClassiXÂ® system, i.e. slots that are loaded from the *.DIC and *.INI files when the system is started up, must neither be changed nor made persistent. Slots once created and made persistent cannot be deleted. However, you can, for example, add their name "ZZ_" and mark them as "deleted", so to speak. Created slots that are still transient cannot be deleted either, but will no longer be available when the system is next booted. Making slots persistent can only be done from the list window, this is a security measure. For example, if you have created several transient slots and you don't want to keep one of them, you can make the slots you want to keep persistent, restart the system and then only the persisted slots will be available. The created transient slot will no longer be displayed.
