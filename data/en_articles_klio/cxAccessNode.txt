This is the description of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography": Especially for the purpose of path optimisation in a high bay warehouse (or other storage locations), access nodes (CX_ACCESS_NODE) and weighted access paths(CX_ACCESS_WAY) between access nodes are maintained in this module.To set up a topography for a bearing, the following procedure is recommended:Assign storage locations to newly created access nodesCreate warehouse topographyWeighting of access routes Check node/path graph Once the topography has been set up, the optimal route between two access nodes or between several access nodes can be displayed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain access nodes (of e.g. storage bins) and the access routes between these access nodes. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding List window: This window is used to list and edit the saved access nodes. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select access nodes. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Option window: All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed with the "OK" button. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Assign storage locations to newly created access nodes: In this window you can specify the settings to assign access nodes to storage bins, i.e. one or more storage bins together receive a newly created access node object. If none of the three possible options is made (across compartments or shelves or the same X, Y coordinates), then each of the previously selected storage bins receives its own access node object. Currently, only one of the three options can be selected in the standard system. In the newly created access node objects, the X, Y and Z coordinates of the storage bins are transferred; if these are not available, the coordinates from the specifications for aisle, shelf and compartment are transferred. If the selected storage bins have already been assigned to access nodes, processing is cancelled. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Create warehouse topography: In this window, you can specify the settings to create a topography of the storage bins, i.e. the access node objects of the storage bins are connected to each other via access route objects, which are also weighted among each other depending on the distance and direction of the access nodes. If access routes have already been assigned to the selected access nodes, processing is aborted. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Weighting of access routes: In this window you can enter weights to enter the weight of new access routes or to recalculate the total weight of existing access routes. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Check node/path graph: This window shows how many other access nodes can be reached from the access node shown in the list. The number displayed at each access node should be the same as the number of access nodes of a warehouse displayed/selected in the list (see field "Number / Selected" at the bottom right of the window), if the graph is fully developed (i.e. all access nodes are "somehow" connected via CX_ACCESS_WAY objects). If this number is lower, an error or missing connections in the graph must be assumed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Optimal route between two access nodes: After entering a start and a destination access node, you can display the nodes that lie on the optimal route between the two access nodes. The focus of this application is to check the route between two access nodes which the system calculates as optimal. By changing the weights of the access routes between access nodes, you can influence the optimal route. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Optimal route between several access nodes: This application calculates the optimal route from a starting point, across several access nodes to an end point. Start and end point can also be the same for a "round trip". This scenario thus represents the "Travelling salesman problem" (TSP), which can no longer be calculated in a reasonable time if the number of access nodes entered is too large (already from about 6 nodes). (The optimal way of "faculty of the number of list entries" possible ways has to be found: see GetNodePermutations).
