This is the description of the module "units" with the name "Units": In the ClassiX® system, all SI units and the most common currencies are defined by default. In addition to these standard defined units, further user-defined units can be added to the system with this module. These can be derived units based on the already defined units, e.g. "km" based on "m", "MJ" (Mega-Joule) based on "J" (Joule) or "T€" based on "€". Or one defines new basic units, such as "pallet", "bottle", etc. For the latter, e.g. part-specific unit tables are then stored on the parts themselves. The units stored in the system can - as soon as they are based on the same units - be converted directly. If this is not the case, conversion tables must be defined. The conversion tables available in the ClassiX system are the above-mentioned part-specific unit tables and tables for currency conversion. All units defined in the system are stored as prime numbers, which ensures precise and fast conversion. Only a limited number, about 500, of user-defined base units, including deleted units, can be created at all. Therefore, if you want to create units on a test basis, please do so in a test system. The limit on the total number of user-defined units is 9700.
