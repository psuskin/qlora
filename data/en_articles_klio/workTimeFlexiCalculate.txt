This is the description of the module "workTimeFlexiCalculate" with the name "Working time accounting": The data for working time accounting are recorded at time recording terminals. Depending on the configuration, a text file with the time bookings is created at the time recording terminals for each day (these files must be read in daily with the app "Import terminal bookings") or the time bookings are posted directly in the working time accounts of the time recorder.In order to calculate the actual working time worked on a day, a so-called daily closing must be carried out. This serves to check the time bookings made at the terminal and to be able to correctly calculate the working time worked. Only if a daily closing has been carried out for a certain day can the corresponding day also be evaluated correctly.The working time rules and working times assigned to employees or their cost centre are used to evaluate the time bookings made at the terminal.From these and the clocking-in and clocking-out data recorded at the terminal, it is now determined whether the employee worked exactly within the prescribed time and duration. In order to define messages about irregularities or rules for the summation of attendance times, the flexitime rules must be used. They specify whether, for example, a message should appear if the employee has already clocked in before his or her actual working time or whether the breaks should be added up or added to the working time. This is the description of the functionality of the module "workTimeFlexiCalculate" with the name "Working time accounting" regarding Functionality: This window is used for working time accounting. Individual or all (if no line has been selected) employees (working time recorders) can be selected. The evaluation is started in the specified period by pressing the button Calculate.
