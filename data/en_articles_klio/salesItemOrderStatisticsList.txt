This is the description of the module "salesItemOrderStatisticsList" with the name "Sales of sales items": This module is used to create statistics on sales items. For this purpose, all the items of sales orders are evaluated in which all forms of sales items - within level 0 - have been ordered.Only those order items whose order header is confirmed are included in the statistics. Unconfirmed orders are ignored in the statistics! In addition to sales order items, parts from intercompany orders are also taken into account, but only if parts and not parts roles have been called (see next section).To call up the statistics, you can differentiate between the part selection and the part role selection. With part selection, all the roles of the selected parts specified in the filter for part roles are included in the statistics. If only individual sub-roles of individual parts are selected, only these appear in the statistics.Note! These sales order statistics are intended purely as sales item quantity, value and contribution margin statistics, they are not billing turnover statistics that can be directly matched to the accrual periods in financial accounting . The period accrual in these sales item statistics is based only on the statistics period set on the respective order header. This is the description of the functionality of the module "salesItemOrderStatisticsList" with the name "Sales of sales items" regarding List window: The parts/part roll selection is done via the toolbar button . When you click on it, a sub-menu appears, which offers the selection by parts directly or parts rolls. After selecting the parts, the creation of the statistics starts automatically. The part roll is only displayed in the list if instead of a part its roll(s) has been selected directly via the part roll selection. If parts are selected directly, the values are output over all its roles. If only the time period is changed after the statistics have been created, the new determination can be started for the previously selected parts/part rolls via the toolbar button can be restarted. In order to also output the contribution margins of the order items summed up according to parts (e.g. for a contribution margin analysis of e.g. spare parts), the option "List format DB analysis" can be activated via the options window, which also lists various contribution margins (against target and actual costs). However, this option can slow down the build-up of the statistics - especially when a large number of parts are involved. Attention! The validity of parts is not considered in these statistics, i.e. quantities/values across exchange objects are not displayed! Using a list once created, the displayed parts can be dragged into the parts precalculation list. A preliminary costing can then be carried out for each selected part. Attention: If the option "Split variant parts" was selected, one line appears in the list for each variant part. If all lines are selected, several preliminary costings are created for the same part in the preliminary part costing!.
