This is the description of the module "packaccn" with the name "Emballages": Packaging means empties or containers (bottles, crates, pallets) with which or in which a buyer receives his goods. Frequently, packaging is made available to the buyer free of charge, so it is necessary to keep a record of how many packages have been delivered or possibly collected, when and with what. With this module of AppsWarehouseÂ® such packaging accounts (e.g. as pallet accounts) can be managed. An emballage account can either be assigned to a partner (e.g. customer or supplier) or to an emballage (e.g. pallet or crate) as account owner. If the account owner of an emballage account is, for example, a customer, this customer can in turn maintain so-called sub-accounts for different emballages: one sub-account for e.g. europallets, another sub-account for e.g. cable drums. Conversely, the partners are assigned to each part of the packaging account as sub-accounts: e.g. the packaging account for Euro pallets holds the customers to whom the goods were delivered on pallets as sub-accounts.
