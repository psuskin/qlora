This is the description of the module "chargeCondition" with the name "Calculatory conditions": Imputed conditions are additional fees or discounts to be paid. They therefore change the value (price) of a document in which they are used and thus offer a flexible pricing instrument. Examples of imputed conditions are discounts/surcharges, freight surcharges or packaging surcharges. This is the description of the functionality of the module "chargeCondition" with the name "Calculatory conditions" regarding Validity of an imputed condition: discountable, packable, freightable, flat rate LP customisable: Sales items, as an example of item rolls, can be labelled as 'discountable' and/or 'packable' and/or 'freightable'. This property of the item is transferred to the order item when it is used. If an order item lacks this property, the value of this item is not calculated when calculating a respective surcharge unless the surcharge was entered as a flat rate. For example, a service item in the order cannot be packed. However, if a percentage packaging surcharge is applied to the entire order, the value of this service item is not included here. The discountable, packable and freightable value of an order group or order is shown. Flat rate LP adjustable means that a list price-related condition of the order header or a group is applied to an item.
