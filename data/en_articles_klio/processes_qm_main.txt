This is the description of the module "processes_qm_main" with the name "Quality assurance - Processes": In spite of all care taken when programming and using a data processing system, errors in data are unavoidable. Tests and input checks do not completely prevent the information base from becoming inconsistent in some areas. Furthermore, the ClassiXÂ® system allows very easy customer-specific changes (customizing): this increases the risk of data errors. To ensure the quality of the information base, data test routines are available for many business units to check consistency and, if necessary, to detect and display incorrect data.
