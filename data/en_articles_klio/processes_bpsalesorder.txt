This is the description of the module "processes_bpsalesorder" with the name "Business processes - sales - quotations and orders": The IT embedding of an offer or order in the overall system describes the assignment between a project/cost unit defined in ClassiXÂ®, an offer/order, an industrial plant and its manufacturer and operator (overview). {img type="fileId" fileId="472" thumb="box" width="100%"} The path to a new offer/order is always the same, but it can be of different length. On the whole, the path is as follows: Company -> operator/manufacturer -> industrial plant -> project -> offer -> order. The shortest route is taken if a follow-up order is to be created as part of an ongoing project. For this purpose the order can be created directly from the project with automatic transfer of the known data. For new projects, it is possible to generate a project with an initial order from the industrial plant. For new customers/interested parties, the entry point of the path is even further ahead, as the company including the role(s) and the plant must first be created. The structure of an offer/order itself should on the one hand clearly define the order from the customer's point of view (sales data), but on the other hand it should also provide all necessary and sufficient information for the processing of the order (technical data) ( overview). {img type="fileId" fileId="474" thumb="box" width="100%"} Order items are created by the sales department. Once all commercial details have been entered completely, the sales department releases the order items via the "Sales release". The items are then technically checked and released. (see also text article, direct delivery). Depending on the definition of the MRP business process, demand approvals are made directly for purchased parts and warehouse reservations are made for stock parts, or these parts are transferred to MRP together with the production parts. The disposition finally decides how a part is to be procured: Should a partial quantity be ordered and the rest produced? Should a partial quantity be taken from stock, another partial quantity procured and the rest produced by the company itself? If complete technical clarification is not possible in a timely manner for production parts, at least the parts already technically defined with long replacement times can be processed as advance requirements.
