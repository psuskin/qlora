This is the description of the module "attrform" with the name "Calculated (formula) material characteristic": A calculated attribute determines the value of the wrapped data field using a formula. This formula determines the possible values (characteristics) of the calculated attribute. The formula is only evaluated at the time of the query of the calculated attribute. Only then is the captured formula calculated. As with the evaluation of any formula in ClassiXÂ®, it may happen that variables are specified in the formula expression that are not automatically found by the system. When creating the formula, it is therefore important to ensure that the calculated attribute is later used in a context in which the formula can be evaluated. The formula can be tested directly in the input window, the required variables are then interactively queried by the system. (see menu item "Test calculated attribute" or corresponding button) In the standard case (formula type = individual) the formula is written directly into the calculated attribute. The syntax of formulas can be found under calculation formulas. You can find more information in the topic Features. This is the description of the functionality of the module "attrform" with the name "Calculated (formula) material characteristic" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain the calculated attribute. {img type="fileId" fileId="242" thumb="box" width="100%"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module "attrform" with the name "Calculated (formula) material characteristic" regarding List window: Serves to list the attribute objects.
