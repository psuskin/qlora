This is the description of the module "neuralNetworkLoad" with the name "Build a neural network": This app is used to create, train and test a neural network. The input data can be made available to the neural network from the system via a list or via an external Excel file. This is the description of the functionality of the module "neuralNetworkLoad" with the name "Build a neural network" regarding Editing window: Within this window is all the functionality for loading, training and testing a new neural network to be created. In the upper area there are the two tabs "Object list view" and "Excel file" to define the source of the training data. After the training data has been defined or read in, the input and output data of the neural network are defined using the columns of the list with the training data. The last step is to specify the parameters of the neural network (see buttons "Initialise NN" and "Finetune NN"). Now you can train the network with the input and output data using the button "Train NN". This can be executed several times in succession, whereby the result of each training cycle is output in a list. By clicking on a training cycle, the quality of the neural network can be displayed again on the basis of all input data. This is the description of the functionality of the module "neuralNetworkLoad" with the name "Build a neural network" regarding Training values: This window lists all input and output columns of the original training data. In addition, for each original value of an output column, the value determined by means of the neural network is also output.
