This is the description of the module "processes_bproitmcest" with the name "Parts preliminary calculation - processes": Parts pre-calculation is used to calculate prices, weight and replacement time of production parts based on all required components (parts). For this purpose, both the bill of materials and the work plan of the production part are exploded. For the explosion of superior and variant parts, it is necessary to define characteristics before the explosion. The processing masks offer this possibility. The exploded resources can either be displayed clearly in a tree view or in a list with all their costs, overheads and lead times.
