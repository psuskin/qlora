This is the description of the module "qm_rounding_qm" with the name "Rounding": This test checks the methods 'Round' and 'RoundAutomatically'. For the first one you have to enter arbitrary values into the fields 'Value' (if possible with decimal places) and into the fields 'Precision' the desired number of decimal places. A click on the button 'Round (Normal)' should now show the results. For Round Automatically you proceed in the same way, except that you can leave the 'Precision' fields empty, because RoundAutomatically itself recognizes from the type or unit how many decimal places are necessary.
