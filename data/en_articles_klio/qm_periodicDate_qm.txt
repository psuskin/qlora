This is the description of the module "qm_periodicDate_qm" with the name "Periodic date object (CX_PERIODIC_DATE)": This is used to check a recurring date. The first rider concerns only one specific day. At the top of the window you can select which day of each month and a number of subsequent days the periodic date contains. Below this you have to enter a sample period. Now the corresponding dates appear in the list. At the bottom you can test if a certain date is included in the periodic date. The next tab works in the same way, except that you can enter specific weekdays instead of the day of a month. The third tab checks periodic data composed of day and month. Here you can again enter the day of a month, but also the month itself and a number of subsequent days.
