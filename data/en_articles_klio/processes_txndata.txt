This is the description of the module "processes_txndata" with the name "Business vouchers": All transaction data are uniformly treated and processed in ClassiXÂ® as so-called business documents. In sales, for example, these are the documents quotations, orders or invoices, in purchasing the orders or delivery reminders, in merchandise management a goods removal document, in financial accounting a posting document, etc. The recording and processing of a document always takes place in three standardised steps: Entry or maintenance of a document or one of its sub-items in dialogue or via interfaces Posting of the document to accounts and in the workflow using the transaction manager defined for this document (Workflow Management) Forwarding of the document in the assigned business processes using the transaction manager defined for this document (business process management) Since posting to accounts and in the workflow and advancing in business processes is done with the help of a transaction manager, a high degree of flexibility is achieved since its behaviour is controlled by rules stored in the database. These rules can be individually adapted to customers without endangering the version security. The rule-based posting of business documents leads to folders that can be structured and dimensioned as desired, which can thus also be called OLAP cubes.
