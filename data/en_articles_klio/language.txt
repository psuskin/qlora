This is the description of the module "language" with the name "Language": Currently, 6,912 languages are known worldwide (www.ethnologue.com). It is not absolutely necessary to store information about languages in ClassiX速 , multilingualism is not dependent on this. Information about languages is necessary, for example, when using the vocabulary module from the AppsWarehouse速 , which is part of the multilingual dictionary in ClassiX速. Languages or their names are coded internationally, whereby there are, among others, the 2-digit ISO 639-1 (administered by the International Information Centre for Terminology (Infoterm) and the 3-digit ISO 639-2 code (administered by the Library of Congress of the USA). The latter code (in terminological form, see below) is used by ClassiX速 as the main code, but the 2-digit ISO 639-1 code can be included as additional information.
