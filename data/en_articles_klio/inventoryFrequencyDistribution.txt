This is the description of the module "inventoryFrequencyDistribution" with the name "Frequency and value distribution": With this app, previously selected inventory items can be divided into freely selectable value ranges. This provides an overview of the value distribution of inventory items, which is particularly useful for stratified inventory sampling. The BIRT reports "Frequency distribution" and "Lorenz curve" are available as standard reports. This is the description of the functionality of the module "inventoryFrequencyDistribution" with the name "Frequency and value distribution" regarding Frequency and value distribution: With regard to a stratified inventory sampling, the upper limit of the 1st stratum (and thus the determination of the variance for further stratification), as well as the upper limit of the last stratum (and thus the determination of the many, low-value inventory items, which account for approx. 50% - 55% of the inventory value and therefore should only be taken by sample) can be determined here.
