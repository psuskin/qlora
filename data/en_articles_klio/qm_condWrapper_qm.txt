This is the description of the module "qm_condWrapper_qm" with the name "Wrapper object (CX_COND_WRAPPER)": With the upper two buttons the normal wrapper can be checked again for correct function (both with transient and persistent objects). On the left the 3 buttons below test the conditioned wrapper under different conditions. The button 'Edit CondWrapper' opens a window, with which you can test the recursion detection of the conditioned wrapper. The button 'Test' always works with the topmost object in the list. With the arrows you can move the objects in the list back and forth. The lowest object 'Alpha' contains a recursion and should cause an error message during the test.
