This is the description of the module "processes_keydata" with the name "Key figures": Key business figures provide information in compact form about the strengths and weaknesses of a company, its current situation and developments. One-dimensional key figure systems are characterised by purely monetarily oriented top key figures. Examples include the DuPont system with the return on investment (ROI) as a performance target and the shareholder value approach. Multi-dimensional systems are characterised by both monetary and non-monetary key performance indicators. These include the Tableu de Bord and Balanced Scorecard (BSC), whose indicators are used to measure the fulfilment of a company's strategic goals. Partial approaches are used to assess the performance of a company in a limited sense. These include, for example, target costing and benchmarking. Process-oriented indicators are also known as key performance indicators (KPI). With its KPI monitor, ClassiXÂ® supports the determination of any key figure systems from posting processes and master data, whereby the summarisation levels can also be set as required. Using drill-down, the key figures can be traced and analysed down to the individual booking record. The following areas are available Supplier evaluation Customer creditworthiness.
