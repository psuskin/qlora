This is the description of the module "cobjrept" with the name "Cost element evaluation per cost object": For individual cost units - separated by cost elements - the accumulated costs posted in financial accounting are displayed. The financial accounting costs can be delimited according to posting periods "from-to" or in total up to one posting period.
