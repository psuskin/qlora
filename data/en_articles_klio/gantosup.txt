This is the description of the module "gantosup" with the name "Gantt chart for Supply Chain Management (SCM)": With this module the supply chain of an order can be edited interactively in the form of a Gantt chart. The start and end dates and the procurement and throughput times can be changed graphically. These changes take place on a copy of the collective order to be able to carry out simulations or if-then situations. By displaying the critical path, it is possible to filter out the parts determining the end date and to process them directly. Only the shortening of lead times along the critical path has a direct effect on the end date. The calculated or manually changed dates and procurement or lead times can then be transferred back to the actual collective order. This is the description of the functionality of the module "gantosup" with the name "Gantt chart for Supply Chain Management (SCM)" regarding Graphic: Used to display a supply chain in the form of a Gantt chart.
