This is the description of the module "procfold" with the name "Activity folder": This module is used to maintain manually created task subfolders of tasks. In contrast to these subfolders, which can be freely described by means of a text or an assignment to a business object, the subfolders of tasks created by the system are those which are created by means of transaction descriptions.
