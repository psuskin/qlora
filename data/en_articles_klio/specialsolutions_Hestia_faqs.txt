In our example, it is invoice 9999999999. Open it, deregister and remove the items. Accordingly, there should also be a terminated successor picklist with the UK invoice 9999999999, which disappears from it after the invoice correction. {img type="fileId" fileId="556" height="100%" width="100%"} Background: There is no function in Hestia to continue an invoice that cannot be reconciled with SAP.
