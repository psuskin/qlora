This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_itemzeroquantityauditing" with the name "Discontinued parts Auditor" regarding Monitor stock levels: If a part is assigned to the discontinued part KPI Auditor, one of its characteristics (here: current.settings) and the stock are evaluated with every stock posting. If current.settings=1 and the stock <= 0, a further message (ITEM_ZERO_QUANTITY) is triggered internally via POST_DATA_MESSAGE, which then triggers the generation of the desired system message.
