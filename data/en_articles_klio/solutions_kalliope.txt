This is the description of the module "solutions_kalliope" with the name "KALLIOPE - Language knowledge": Talk to our solutions in natural language "The meaning of a word is its use in language "(quotation: Wittgenstein, L., Schriften I., Frankfurt a.M., Suhrkamp 1969, p.311, ยง43) The multilingual dictionary KALLIOPE manages not only words from any number of languages, but also their usage and their corresponding meaning. Thus, a word in one language is not merely juxtaposed with possible words in another language, but a juxtaposition or "translation" always takes place only via the same or a similar meaning.This is of great importance especially with regard to the use of words in special domains (business administration, technology, science), i.e. in areas in which special languages have developed. For this reason, languages are managed in KALLIOPE with their varieties in order to be able to set up specific specialised dictionaries. Languages Any number of languages can be used. Language varieties can be defined for each language. Free definition of which languages to work with simultaneously.
