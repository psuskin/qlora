This is the description of the module "processes_qm_bat" with the name "Suppressed errors": Batch run refers to database operations in which data is automatically processed in the background or as a night run without the user being able to interactively influence it. Therefore, no information messages, queries or error messages appear. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_qm_bat" with the name "Suppressed errors" regarding Functionality: Since individual data may have been entered incorrectly or incompletely (e.g. missing costs for a part) and the operation should not be disrupted as a result (i.e. it must be possible to remove this part from storage even if the costs have not been entered), the user must be able to check after these runs which data were not successfully processed. In ClassiXÂ®, these error and warning messages are collected in monitors provided for this purpose and can be clearly accessed and managed/corrected by the user. These monitors are divided into the respective database operations: All documents that are not processed correctly are assigned to these monitors with an error message. If, for example, the costs for the order part or production part cannot be completely determined during a stock removal, the item is not posted in the final costing but an entry with the error description is created in the error monitor "stock removal". The errors can be retrieved and corrected in the "Suppressed errors" module. For the order cost evaluation and the warehouse statistics it is important that these errors are corrected before the statistics are compiled.
