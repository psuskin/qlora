The same happens when opening via the part, except that the "Role -> Part" window is only filled if the part only has one role. If this is not the case, it is hidden. By selecting a role, you can then access the "Role -> Part" window via the icon with the "theatre mask". This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemCast" with the name "Parts and rolls" regarding Assign new roles: If a part has already been created, for example as a product, and now becomes an order part, you can simply add a new role to the existing entry. Select the entry in the parts list and click on the role icon. Next click on 'Create', select the additional role of the part and add it to the existing entry with 'Select'. The input mask for the order data opens automatically (in this example). You can now add or change the specific data in this mask. If the order part number is not automatically assigned by the counter, you should assign and enter it. Then close the mask with 'OK' to save your entries! Now two roles are assigned to the part. If you do not see them immediately, close the mask once and open it again to display the list updated. You can edit the product or order part data by double clicking on the respective role.
