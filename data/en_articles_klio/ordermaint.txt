This is the description of the module "ordermaint" with the name "Maintenance contracts due": Service provider groups in customer orders, which are of the type "maintenance contract", can be assigned a cycle and a period. On the first day of the entered period, this maintenance order is then due for the first time. A follow-up order must be created from it. To do this, there is this evaluation. An end time for finding due maintenance orders up to this date can be specified. In order to see all due maintenance orders up to this point, not only the first due one, the so named check mark must be set. Example: An order must be performed monthly. If the tick "All due" is not set, only the first due date is displayed.If the tick is set, all those that must be created by the check date are displayed. Now the entries can be marked and the orders can be created on their respective due dates by clicking on the toolbar button "Create orders". It is confirmed with a message: All tasks created! The created orders can be found via the cost object. The capacities for these orders are then booked directly and are visible via the capacity utilisation.
