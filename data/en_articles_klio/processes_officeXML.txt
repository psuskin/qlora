This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_officeXML" with the name "XML interface for MS Office" regarding Word: Since many documents in the database are only available as COM objects, there is a special tool object which offers the conversion from COM to XML. Like the COM objects, the CX_WORD_XML objects can be created persistently and saved in the database. For performance reasons, not every change to the document is directly transferred to the database, but is initially only recorded in the "transient area" of the object. To record the changes in the database there is the call SaveXMLString. The interface offers the following functionality. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_officeXML" with the name "XML interface for MS Office" regarding Excel: Since Excel documents are usually not kept in the database, there is no way to create a corresponding XML object from a COM object. For performance and storage reasons, there are two operating modes for Excel that support different functionality. Each newly opened Excel document is opened in a very high-performance read-only mode, which allows to process .xlsx files of any size. However, this mode does not support write operations, and the first time an operation is performed on the object, the object is automatically converted and set to write mode. This still provides fast read access to the data, but is limited in the size of the Excel files.
