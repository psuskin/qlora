This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocextjobsched" with the name "Extended workbench" regarding Description: Many manufacturing processes require work to complete a part or an assembly that your own company cannot provide (e.g. special surface finishing such as galvanising). For this purpose, ClassiXÂ® offers the possibility to integrate external work sequences into work plans. It is also possible that the work is to be carried out completely by an external company. The external manufacturer needs all the material of the production stage, whether pre-assembled or not, to carry out the work. For all these cases the external work sequences are suitable. If only a part of the parts list is to be sent to the external manufacturer because he procures or owns the rest of the required parts himself, it is more advisable to declare the part not as a production part with external work sequence, but as a purchased part with self-supply. Description of provided parts. Each workstation can contain resources in the form of machines, work groups or suppliers. These resources assigned to the work centre in this way can be used freely on the routing as soon as the work centre has been selected on the routing item. Since routings themselves are only assigned to the part to be produced (the part to be finished, e.g. water pump), but the purchase order for the external work must be created via another part or unit of activity (e.g. unit of activity galvanising), the order article via which the external work is ordered can also be specified on the work sequence. The external work sequence therefore contains the following data, which makes it the external work sequence:.
