This is the description of the module "cxDocumentIndex" with the name "Document master": Terms/Definitions File Location Printing documentsThe document master in ClassiX® offers the possibility to manage digital documents. An EDM system (Electronic Document Management), respectively a DMS(Document Management System) is already integrated in ClassiX®.The advantage of the integrated solution is the direct association of documents to receipts or master data. The drawings of an article can thus be maintained directly via the parts mask and the documents belonging to an order can be directly linked to the ClassiX order.The associations of the transaction data with the documents can be maintained via a separate editing mask, which can be called up via the document history module, for example. In the master data there is a tab "Documents" for this purpose, as for example in the parts mask. If this tab is not available on the processing mask, documents can be linked via the transaction folder or directly via the processing mask of the document entry.Both the master data and the transaction data can either refer directly to the documents or via a conditional table. A conditional table is useful, for example, if the documents of a variant part are managed and different versions should lead to different documents.

However, there are other possibilities for OLE documents stored in the database. In the tab "OLE document" you can view and edit the document. In addition, document variables can be accessed here, via which the document can read information from the ClassiX® system. (To update the variables please use the Refresh button).

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxDocumentIndex" with the name "Document master" regarding Moving documents: This window allows you to move documents and move the associated document references. It is useful to move files or folders with this function, because only this guarantees that the document references in ClassiX are adjusted and point to the moved file. About the function in general: The folder from which the files are to be moved and the folder which is the destination folder are selected. Then all document references are searched to see if they contain references to a file in the source folder. If this is the case, the file is moved to the destination folder and the document reference is adjusted with regard to the link.
