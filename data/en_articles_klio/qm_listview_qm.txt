This is the description of the module "qm_listview_qm" with the name "English:ObjectListView (MegaList)": This test is again about lists. With the menu 'Edit' the window can be filled with a number of records. With 'Extend Collection' you can extend the collection as you like. After filling, you can now edit the records by double-clicking on them, sort the list by clicking on the corresponding attributes (with Ctrl+click on an attribute you can set this as a second sorting criterion) or delete selected records by right-clicking on the context menu.
