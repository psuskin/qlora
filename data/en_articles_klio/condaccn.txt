This is the description of the module "condaccn" with the name "Conditional account": This module is called from the modules of the sales statistics groups and purchasing statistics groups and is used for the account assignment of outgoing and incoming invoices. If the account assignment is carried out via the classification term "sales statistics" in such a way that the respective structure nodes lead to individual sales statistics groups and these in turn are to directly address an account, then this account can be entered in this module without any conditions.
