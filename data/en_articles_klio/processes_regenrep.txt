This is the description of the module "processes_regenrep" with the name "Regeneration and replication": Data security and system availability play an extremely important role in business critical applications. Therefore, database backup, just like recovery, is very easy and efficient with ClassiX速. The ClassiX速 database consists of only one single file, which can be copied at any time to create a backup copy or to have current "game data" available at any time, e.g. for training or testing purposes. In case of an irreparable server computer failure, it is sufficient to simply copy the ClassiX速 system and the database to another computer, install the database server there (done within a few minutes) and the ClassiX速 system is immediately ready for use again. In addition to this "offline replication", "online replication" to any other database server is of course also possible.
