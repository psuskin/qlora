This is the description of the module "lostpartner" with the name "Rebuild search terms": If all search terms have been deleted by partners, they can no longer be found by entering search terms. This can occur after new data has been read in. It is also possible that the search term is inadvertently overwritten with the name of the partner. For this purpose there is a "recovery tool", which can be reached and started via the menu ""Options->Maintenance->Rebuild search terms" of the company search (rebuilds partner search terms) and the person search (rebuilds person search terms). A new search term with the name of the partner is created for these found partners. If the name is also unfilled, which is also intercepted in the current version, the search term "generated" is entered. The name of the partner is also newly created as a search term if it is not found. All data whose name was not filled in and which therefore received the search term "generated" appear in the list after the maintenance run. Here, the search term can now be changed or supplemented by double-clicking on the corresponding data record. With these data it is also possible that an empty search term is present. This should then also be deleted manually.
