This is the description of the module "qm_security_qm" with the name "Quality assurance - Access rights": The test opens five windows. The title of each window gives an indication of the permissions set when FillWindow is called. With "Read only", for example, it should not be possible to enter text in the fields. With "No access" the fields should not be visible at all. In the first window, different authorisations can also be set manually. The window contains the following buttons for this purpose: "readwrite": Allow reading and writing of objects. " readonly: Allow reading of objects only. "no access": Do not allow any access to objects. "no access to name": Generally allow reading and writing of objects, but block access to data field 'name'. "no access to age (obj)": Generally allow reading and writing of objects, but block access to data field 'Age()'. But only for the CX_PERSON object used in the test (test for CX_OBJECT_SECURITY). "save": Saves the object in its current state, provided the permissions allow it. "close all": Closes the five windows.
