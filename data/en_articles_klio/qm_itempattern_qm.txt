This is the description of the module "qm_itempattern_qm" with the name "Variant parts (CX_ITEM_PATTERN)": This test is intended to check the resolution of a variant part into its subparts. Each time the window is opened, a variant part is created with a list of characteristics with the characteristics POWER_MOTOR, NUMBER OF ROTATION and DIAMETER. Also 2 lower parts with different characteristics. For testing, a CX_ALLOCATION_TXN is created with an AttributeSet, which is plugged to the resolution. Here you can make the desired test settings and with a click on "Test resolution" you can check if the correct subpart is found by the function "Item()" called in the test. The determined part is then marked in the upper list. You could now manually check whether a characteristic is expected in the plug space even if this characteristic is preset in the characteristic bar of the variant part and the type is not set to "Without value specification". The result is: It is still expected. (An error message appears stating that DemandVariables may only be called with a registered message).
