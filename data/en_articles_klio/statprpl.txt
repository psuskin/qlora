This is the description of the module "statprpl" with the name "Production planning orders": This list should be the basis for the coordination between sales and production and thus the starting point for the timely scheduling of sales orders in production. Furthermore, it offers the possibility to evaluate the commissioned, performed or still to be performed service of a production company as a whole (see option Performance). As a basis for this production planning, sales order items can be listed here by means of various global selection criteria (see Tabular parts, characteristics, other restrictions) or direct individual selection. The core data displayed includes customer, parts, quantity, price and date information for the individual items. In addition, the resource allocation (which can be switched on and off via an option) can be listed (also controllable via an option as target, actual and open times).
