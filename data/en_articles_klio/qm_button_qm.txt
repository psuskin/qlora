This is the description of the module "qm_button_qm" with the name "English:Buttons": This test checks the display of the different button types. The first thing that appears is a normal button. Below this is a non-selectable button and one that reveals a tooltip. The next two buttons demonstrate the use of images. The first one contains only one image and the second one changes its appearance by swapping two images with one click.
