If no annual financial statement has yet been carried out for an asset, the depreciation possible for tax purposes at the end of a financial year - based on the depreciation rule defined in the asset - is output as the calculated value. Otherwise, the year-end depreciation actually carried out by means of an annual financial statement is output. The totals list corresponds to the fixed asset schedule in the logic of the output of its columns. In addition, the development of the value of the fixed assets since the end of the last financial year can be tracked in the totals list. The following calculation (based on the column values) is possible for this purpose: Book value PY (previous year) plus additions in the current financial year minus \"Value on disposal\" of a financial year (do not confuse this column with column \"Disposal\") plus transfers in the current financial year plus write-ups in the current financial year minus depreciation in the current financial year = book value FY (at the end of the financial year)As a cross-check (based on the fixed-asset movement schedule), the following calculation can also be made: AfA-BMGL plus additions in the current business year minus disposals in the current financial year (do not confuse this column with the column \"value at disposal\") plus transfers in the current financial year plus write-ups in the current financial year minus accum.

In such a case, requirement requests for purchased parts or stock orders for production parts can be generated directly from the list. 2. inventory control involves analysing the stocks available today (total stock of a part as of today) and the balance of future movements (balance of all stock reservations, orders, production orders, etc.) This analysis is supported by rules (formulas). These rules include evaluations for e.g. lists of slow-moving items, test runs for parts with negative stock, negative order or production quantity and, of course, balanced minimum stock underruns. This evaluation is available in a time-aggregated form as a requirements/stock overview . The requirements and stock list can also be called up for individual company codes."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhich module is being described?\n\n### Context:\nTo be able to calculate the planned workload of an employee, workstation, machine or other resource against the available time budget, a total planned time for a period (usually calendar weeks) must be entered. Here the full working time is given without taking holidays into account, e.g. for employees with 40 hour weeks for one year 8 hours daily. Capacity planning therefore only forms the basic time frame of the employee. Absence times, such as holiday or illness, are maintained via the employee's absence times, which automatically reduces the planned capacity in this period by the employee and all assigned work groups. Employees and work groups can be planned precisely by the day, other resources only by the week.

        "output": "The module capacityPlanning serves the following purpose: To be able to calculate the planned workload of an employee, workstation, machine or other resource against the available time budget, a total planned time for a period (usually calendar weeks) must be entered. Here the full working time is given without taking holidays into account, e.g. for employees with 40 hour weeks for one year 8 hours daily. Capacity planning therefore only forms the basic time frame of the employee. Absence times, such as holiday or illness, are maintained via the employee's absence times, which automatically reduces the planned capacity in this period by the employee and all assigned work groups. Employees and work groups can be planned precisely by the day, other resources only by the week. For employees, it is advisable to schedule the capacity in normal daily working hours, i.e. as a rule, 8h is entered in the Capacity field and the grid is set to \"Days\".

Business-relevant data, such as a person 's function, department, business e-mail and telephone extensions, are maintained with this module. For the purpose of a successful CRM, it is also necessary to classify contact persons according to their importance or other criteria (e.g. \"gets Christmas card\"). This can be done by means of general classification terms or user-specific favourites (see additional data). Persons can be employees of different companies at the same time; employee information is role objects for persons. As a rule, the person object is automatically created when a new employee is created; if the person already exists, the employee information must be created by inserting a role. The listing or maintenance of employees can be done from the company master screen or one of its roles using the button This distinction becomes particularly important when a transaction document is called up from the contact person: Accordingly, the activity folder of his company or company role is inserted in addition to the activity folder of the contact person."

Counters are required for master data (customers, G/L accounts, parts, etc.) and documents (invoices, orders, purchase orders, etc.) in order to specify sequential numbering. The formatting of the number (e.g. whether with or without leading zeros) is also determined in the counter. Usually, the name of the meter is the same as the class name of the object to be numbered (e.g. CX_CUSTOMER for the customer number meter). The register of a counter can be delegated to the register of another counter. This is used, for example, if the number range for outgoing invoices and outgoing credit memos is to be the same. In this case, the counter for A/R credit notes (CX_CREDIT_NOTE) is delegated to the counter for A/R invoices (CX_INVOICE). A conditional table can also be used to distribute a register to several other counters, e.g. if the number range for orders is to be different depending on the order type.If you want to reset the counters for e.g. A/R invoices at the beginning of a fiscal year, you can create (copy) a separate counter for each fiscal year - controlled by the validity. In this way, for example, the counter \"CX_INVOICE\" for A/R invoices would then exist several times, each with a validity related to the fiscal year.

Other business objects can also hold an account of the type \"storage bin\", e.g. forklift trucks for the short-term storage of goods. It is not possible to make a stock entry (entry, removal, transfer) without having defined at least one warehouse with at least one storage bin beforehand. A warehouse can have any number of storage bins, a storage bin is always assigned to only one warehouse. Storage bins typically have a bin \"number\" which is or should be exactly the same as the identification of a particular storage bin in the physical warehouse. In addition to information on location, size and capacity calculation, storage bins can be assigned to various sort keys, for example, to assign the storage bin to a storage type, storage section, picking area, staging area, door, or transfer zone, etc. Once the evaluation groups have been assigned, characteristics can be added to them in order to optimally control the warehouse management. In the standard system, the term \"picking zone\" (also often referred to as storage area) is predefined as a classification term for a storage bin with identifier \"PICKING_ZONE\". Sub-terms for freely definable picking areas are: Fast-moving items, Slow-moving items, etc.The term \"perpetual inventory\" is also predefined in the standard system as a classification term with the identifier \"CONTINOUS_STOCKTAKING\". Within this order structure, the storage bins are divided into individual subgroups for which inventories are then carried out one after the other in the course of a year. In this way, an inventory plan is defined for all storage bins, which ensures that each storage bin is counted at least once within a business year. The warehouse assigned to a storage bin can also be assigned to sort keys (see sort key \"STORAGE_TYPE\" for storage types), it is up to the internal organisation to find an optimal structure of the data for the company. Storage locations can be assigned to a topography of a warehouse in order to optimise paths in the warehouse. It is recommended that the storage locations are specified for aisle/rack/compartment (see utility Split storage location numbers into aisle/rack/compartment, which can be called up from the menu of the list window) and their X, Y and Z coordinates are set (see utility Import X, Y and Z coordinates of storage locations, which can be called up from the menu of the list window).

        "output": "The module cxStockSpace can be described as follows: Storage bins are objects of the type \"account\" (CX_STOCK_SPACE) and have the task of managing stock quantities of parts in a warehouse or storage aids. Other business objects can also hold an account of the type \"storage bin\", e.g. forklift trucks for the short-term storage of goods. It is not possible to make a stock entry (entry, removal, transfer) without having defined at least one warehouse with at least one storage bin beforehand. A warehouse can have any number of storage bins, a storage bin is always assigned to only one warehouse. Storage bins typically have a bin \"number\" which is or should be exactly the same as the identification of a particular storage bin in the physical warehouse. In addition to information on location, size and capacity calculation, storage bins can be assigned to various sort keys, for example, to assign the storage bin to a storage type, storage section, picking area, staging area, door, or transfer zone, etc. Once the evaluation groups have been assigned, characteristics can be added to them in order to optimally control the warehouse management. In the standard system, the term \"picking zone\" (also often referred to as storage area) is predefined as a classification term for a storage bin with identifier \"PICKING_ZONE\". Sub-terms for freely definable picking areas are: Fast-moving items, Slow-moving items, etc.The term \"perpetual inventory\" is also predefined in the standard system as a classification term with the identifier \"CONTINOUS_STOCKTAKING\". Within this order structure, the storage bins are divided into individual subgroups for which inventories are then carried out one after the other in the course of a year. In this way, an inventory plan is defined for all storage bins, which ensures that each storage bin is counted at least once within a business year. The warehouse assigned to a storage bin can also be assigned to sort keys (see sort key \"STORAGE_TYPE\" for storage types), it is up to the internal organisation to find an optimal structure of the data for the company. Storage locations can be assigned to a topography of a warehouse in order to optimise paths in the warehouse. It is recommended that the storage locations are specified for aisle/rack/compartment (see utility Split storage location numbers into aisle/rack/compartment, which can be called up from the menu of the list window) and their X, Y and Z coordinates are set (see utility Import X, Y and Z coordinates of storage locations, which can be called up from the menu of the list window). The window for maintaining a storage location can only be called up via the module for maintaining a warehouse ."

However, since the status of a document can be dependent on the status of another document, it must be possible to link several business processes of different documents with each other in order to map the complete process chain. This run through different business processes is called a process route.A simple example of this is the process route of a production part to be manufactured for an order:Before production, the order item runs from status \"created\" to status \"bill of material released\". If a production order - as a new document of another business process - with the status \"created\" is now created from this status, the order item itself is switched to the next status \"production order\" (PRODUCTION_ORDER). The order item remains in this status until the production order has reached the status \"provided\". Only then does the status of the order item change to \"ready\": Production\" (PRODUCTION_PROVISION).Such concatenations are possible within the transition descriptions in the individual status monitors, in the following figure using the example of the transition from the initial state \"Production order\" (PRODUCTION_ORDER) to the subsequent state \"Ready: Production\" (PRODUCTION_PROVISION): The process route to which this transition belongs is selected via the \"Process routes\" button. Then, by double-clicking on the newly assigned process route, the detailed processing of this assignment can be carried out.

The possible start statuses of the follow-on documents can now be inserted into the list \"Follow-on monitors\" by clicking the \"Insert\" button. It is also possible to drag and drop the successor status directly into the list.Some data that the system cannot automatically find out must then be added: On the one hand, the class of the follow-on document must be specified (in this example CX_PRODUCTION_ORDER for a production order), and on the other hand, the process name must be entered.

Each document defined in CyberEnterprise® (e.g. invoice, order, goods receipt, etc.) is subject to one or more predefined business processes. Within such business processes, a document passes through the statuses specified by the business process, e.g. an order can have the status \"partially delivered\" with regard to the delivery process. In addition to these processes - which are firmly defined by corresponding specifications of the company process organisation - such processes must also be possible in which a user can freely decide who, when, should receive which document for inspection, checking, etc. These freely definable workflows correspond to the circulation folders common in newspapers or magazines, for example, which readers pass on to each other. In CyberEnterprise® (digital) circular files can be created for all documents, but also for any associations to e.g. documents, Excel, Word or pdf files, etc. and passed on electronically between the users. Each user recognises the processes to be processed by him in the folder \"My circulars\". A digital circular should always be used when direct e-mailing of documents between employees is not sufficient in terms of transparency of an entire process, as the employees' e-mail accounts cannot be viewed by third parties. The mask for creating a new circular depends on the progress indicator of the start state of the selected business process. If a new circular is created directly from a document via a menu item that may be present there in the maintenance screen or via the icon is created, the system checks whether this document has already been assigned to a circular with the same business process. If this is the case, the circular cannot be created in this direct way, but the circular must first be created and the document must be assigned to this circular as an association afterwards.

Since an inventory is supposed to represent a comparison/check of the (book) stocks in the DP system with the actual stocks in the warehouse, inventories are initially generated from data in the DP. In combination with the inventory analysis app, inventory sampling is also supported. Inventories are an important part of monthly and annual financial statements. As part of accounting, inventories are subject to strict organisational guidelines."

In the second place, it is also possible to create evaluations of already created recurring A/R invoices or an overview of all recurring A/R invoices. A recurring A/R invoice to be issued can be defined via an order in two ways. Firstly, a sales order can be of the type \"maintenance contract\" and a payment condition of the type \"recurring payment\" and the settlement type \"lump sum payment\". This type of recurring A/R invoice is useful if, for example, the invoice is for flat-rate maintenance. A second way of defining a recurring A/R invoice is to enter an order item with a payment term of the \"recurring payment\" type. This option can also be used, for example, to bill for maintenance if the maintenance does not have to be paid as a lump sum (fixed price), but rather depending on a quantity (price per unit or per licence). In this case, the order item defines in more detail the amount of maintenance (e.g.: 15 licences * 100€/licence = 1,500€) and the payment conditions of the type \"recurring payment\" define the billing period (e.g. monthly, yearly, etc.). The rent for software, for example, can also be invoiced in this way. The preparation of such recurring outgoing invoices is based on the following rules: An A/R invoice is always issued on the first day of the period entered on the recurring payment term. The period (\"Check by date\") is used to check whether a recurring outgoing invoice should be issued by this date. Based on the interval defined in the condition, the system automatically checks how often and when the recurring outgoing invoice is to be created. Already settled, recurring outgoing invoices can be listed as an option. After listing the recurring outgoing invoices to be issued, the outgoing invoices can be generated for the selected entries by clicking on the invoice button in the toolbar. Items are combined to one A/R invoice if the order and the due date are identical. In this way, orders with different recurring payment items (e.g. 30 licenses as monthly rent + 1 monthly maintenance flat rate) can be settled via one invoice.\n\n### Response:",

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nName this module.\n\n### Context:\nThe ClassiX® system distinguishes between a part and the possible roles of a part. A part itself contains the descriptive data that can be named regardless of its use. For example, a part could be completely described by \"carpet\". Depending on its use, further data entities or roles are obtained: If the \"carpet\" is sold, then sales-specific data such as sales price, is maintained in the role sales item . Further roles would be order article (with data like main supplier, last purchase price) , production part (with data like bill of material, routing, lot size), etc. In ClassiX® any roles can be assigned to a part.Furthermore, ClassiX® distinguishes between single part, sub-part and variant part:A variant part describes a group of things or parts that are distinguished by certain characteristics: For example, \"carpet\" can be distinguished by colour and width. We then say that the variant part \"carpeting\" is described by the characteristic bar with the characteristics colour and width.A subpart is a unique characteristic of a variant part, e.g. \"Carpet: Colour red, width 4m\" . There is a direct assignment to a variant part, in our example to the variant part \"carpet\". Sub-parts can be detached (decoupled) from a variant part at any time and thus become an individual part.Individual parts are not variant parts and are not subordinate to a variant part. Individual parts can, however, be subsequently assigned (coupled) to variant parts. Usually, most EDP systems only support single parts.The advantage of processing with variant parts is that previously unknown characteristics of a part do not always have to lead to data entry. For example, if a customer wants a \"carpet\" with the colour pink and a \"carpet\" of this colour has never been processed before, this \"carpet\" can be ordered directly from the supplier as a variant part with the new characteristic pink without entering a new order article.The characteristic bar of a variant part consists of various characteristics or attributes. In our example above, these were the attributes colour and size . The attribute size can also be a formula attribute, i.e. it is calculated from the attributes\"length times width\". In this case, the attributes length and width must be specified in the subpart.The variant part \"carpet\" can of course be specified more precisely by further attributes. For example, material type (such as wool, plastic, or similar), pile thickness (in mm), pattern, etc. would be possible. One could even go so far as to define all carpets in the world as a sub-part of only one variant part. However, this would require an increase in the number of characteristics to be able to describe each carpet in a sufficiently distinguishable way from the others.To what extent parts are described with different variant parts - or whether variant parts are used at all - depends very much on the individual case.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nHow is this module called?\n\n### Context:\nThe constantly changing requirements in the markets lead to a constant adaptation and expansion of the own product range (external variance). In addition, the company's own engineering and production also contributes to changes in the parts used (internal variance). This external and internal variance often leads to a constant growth of the own parts base and can lead to increasing difficulties to configure the own products customer-specific and error-free.Carefully constructed parts classes or other ontologies can help to keep an overview and order in the parts master, but they usually cannot prevent the parts master from growing per se. Also missing is the definition of a configuration logic for the own products.By introducing sustainable variant management, the growth of the parts master can be slowed down sustainably, which automatically leads to an increased overview, improved order in the parts master and overall to improved efficiency in the production process. On the other hand, the necessary configuration logic for one's own product range results almost in parallel.For this purpose, it is first necessary to find \"similar\" parts in the part master, i.e. to find and structure groups of parts in such a way that the individual members of a group can only be unambiguously described by different versions of one and the same set of characteristics. The attribute scale itself is determined by the group and is therefore valid for all members (parts) of the group.For each group of parts, a so-called variant part with its specific characteristics is then created. The parts of the group are then assigned to the variant part as so-called sub-parts, whereby the characteristics list is defined for each of these sub-parts according to the characteristics of the sub-part. The sub-parts assigned to a variant part clearly show the differences between these sub-parts with regard to the characteristic values of the features.Here it can often already be established that sub-parts have been defined unnecessarily, since their characteristics - clearly described by the characteristic bar - are quite comparable and even substitutable with other sub-parts of the same variant part.The consistent introduction of product features, product feature strips and variant parts gives the entire parts master a clear structure. The focus is no longer on the individual parts, but rather on material features, i.e. characteristics that determine the parts to be used. The rules of configuration logic then only refer to characteristics - i.e. properties - and no longer directly to part numbers.This separation of the configuration logic from part numbers also makes it possible to determine configurations with parts for which there is still \"no part number\": in this case, the configuration determines variant parts with those characteristics for which there is (still) no subpart in the variant part. This does not have to be the case, because the desired - non-existent - part is clearly specified by the variant part and the distinct attribute list. With this unambiguous specification, it can be processed throughout the entire logistics process even without a system in the part master.Variant parts and their associated lower parts with a distinct list of characteristics can thus help to increase the diversity of the product range without creating an overflowing parts master: in this way, variance can be controlled.\n\n### Response:",

        "output": "The module itemVarianceAnalyze serves the following purpose: The constantly changing requirements in the markets lead to a constant adaptation and expansion of the own product range (external variance). In addition, the company's own engineering and production also contributes to changes in the parts used (internal variance). This external and internal variance often leads to a constant growth of the own parts base and can lead to increasing difficulties to configure the own products customer-specific and error-free.Carefully constructed parts classes or other ontologies can help to keep an overview and order in the parts master, but they usually cannot prevent the parts master from growing per se. Also missing is the definition of a configuration logic for the own products.By introducing sustainable variant management, the growth of the parts master can be slowed down sustainably, which automatically leads to an increased overview, improved order in the parts master and overall to improved efficiency in the production process. On the other hand, the necessary configuration logic for one's own product range results almost in parallel.For this purpose, it is first necessary to find \"similar\" parts in the part master, i.e. to find and structure groups of parts in such a way that the individual members of a group can only be unambiguously described by different versions of one and the same set of characteristics. The attribute scale itself is determined by the group and is therefore valid for all members (parts) of the group.For each group of parts, a so-called variant part with its specific characteristics is then created. The parts of the group are then assigned to the variant part as so-called sub-parts, whereby the characteristics list is defined for each of these sub-parts according to the characteristics of the sub-part. The sub-parts assigned to a variant part clearly show the differences between these sub-parts with regard to the characteristic values of the features.Here it can often already be established that sub-parts have been defined unnecessarily, since their characteristics - clearly described by the characteristic bar - are quite comparable and even substitutable with other sub-parts of the same variant part.The consistent introduction of product features, product feature strips and variant parts gives the entire parts master a clear structure. The focus is no longer on the individual parts, but rather on material features, i.e. characteristics that determine the parts to be used. The rules of configuration logic then only refer to characteristics - i.e. properties - and no longer directly to part numbers.This separation of the configuration logic from part numbers also makes it possible to determine configurations with parts for which there is still \"no part number\": in this case, the configuration determines variant parts with those characteristics for which there is (still) no subpart in the variant part. This does not have to be the case, because the desired - non-existent - part is clearly specified by the variant part and the distinct attribute list. With this unambiguous specification, it can be processed throughout the entire logistics process even without a system in the part master.Variant parts and their associated lower parts with a distinct list of characteristics can thus help to increase the diversity of the product range without creating an overflowing parts master: in this way, variance can be controlled."

By default, all texts in AppsWarehouse® Code (window titles, field labels, hint texts, etc.) are written in German as the first and English as the second, so-called bridge language. The respective expressions in these two languages together form the \"key\" for unambiguous identification of a text. Using this \"key\", the texts can be changed (for alternative designations: e.g. device - instrument - installation) and/or freely assigned to a language as of the third language (French). These extensions and/or changes to the texts from the AppsWarehouse code are written to the file appsWHLiterals.stg (formerly: cxstring-uc.002) with the above-mentioned \"key\" (see Stored text constants in file cxstring_uc.002).At runtime, the displayed texts are then adapted/overwritten/extended using the entries in this file.In addition, you can have a *.info file created (usually cxstring-uc.002.info), by means of which you can freeze a specific version of the AppsWarehouse text constants. If changes are made in the AppsWarehouse code afterwards, it can be determined in which modules/apps certain text constants used to be (see Text constants unrelated to AppsWarehouse®).The languages that can be selected or used at runtime are defined in the location-specific data (language, system number of the language).

The respective expressions in these two languages together form the \"key\" for unambiguous identification of a text. Using this \"key\", the texts can be changed (for alternative designations: e.g. device - instrument - installation) and/or freely assigned to a language as of the third language (French). These extensions and/or changes to the texts from the AppsWarehouse code are written to the file appsWHLiterals.stg (formerly: cxstring-uc.002) with the above-mentioned \"key\" (see Stored text constants in file cxstring_uc.002).At runtime, the displayed texts are then adapted/overwritten/extended using the entries in this file.In addition, you can have a *.info file created (usually cxstring-uc.002.info), by means of which you can freeze a specific version of the AppsWarehouse text constants. If changes are made in the AppsWarehouse code afterwards, it can be determined in which modules/apps certain text constants used to be (see Text constants unrelated to AppsWarehouse®).The languages that can be selected or used at runtime are defined in the location-specific data (language, system number of the language). How many and which languages are actually to be used within an application is specified in the client under System/Language Control. If nothing is specified there, the number of languages is determined directly from the location-specific data."

Please also read the description on the subject of location-specific data in the installation documentation This module is used to create, maintain and manage location-specific data. These can represent and explain federal states, provinces and any deeply nested regions. When a user logs on to the system, the system checks whether a separate company calendar (locale) exists at the employing company (place of employment of the employee). If so, this locale calendar is logged on, otherwise it is checked whether the locale has one and so on up to the top locale. If no company calendar was found in this way, the system checks whether there is a locale at the client company and registers it. If no locale is linked here either, the locale specified in the batch file via the environment variables for country, state and region is registered. As the ClassiX® system knows the connections between different localities, for example the superordinate country of any state or region, the following possibilities arise: Generally speaking, a country's characteristics are handed down to a federal state and then to subordinate regions. However, some of this information can be overwritten by directly changing a certain property in a subordinate locality, for example a federal state. Now this new property applies to this subordinate locality and all its subordinate localities, for example regions. Of course you can also change the same property in some of the subordinate localities, for example in regions. However, a region can also pass on properties to a federal state and this to the higher-level state. This is the special case where a superior locality has at least all time zones of its subordinate localities. Of course, the time zones of the superior locality can be extended, but not restricted. This is another reason why you need to be sure where you are making settings. That is why the characteristics of a locality are divided into informative characteristics of the superior country, characteristics to be set in the superior country and characteristics to be set in this locality: Informative characteristics of a country are: - Country name - Country code - Number plate - Winter/summer time or summer/winter time changeover These properties are taken from internal tables and cannot be changed by the user to ensure consistency with reality. These informative properties are valid for the country and all its subordinate localities. The characteristics of a country to be set are: - National currency - International area code - Number format - Date and time These characteristics are from a superior country, not from a subordinate locality, and must therefore be changed at the state level. These properties to be set are valid for the country and all its subordinate localities. The properties of a locality to be set are: - Place name - Language - System number of the language - Time zone or start and end time zone (regions have only one time zone) - Working days - Telecommunications - Holidays and holidays These properties are specific to a particular location and can therefore be set at all levels. If these properties are only set at state level, they are also valid for all subordinate localities. However, as mentioned above, these can be changed at a subordinate local level. These changes are valid for the edited locality and all its subordinate localities. Telecommunication is an exception, as these settings are only valid for your own locality, neither taken from above nor transferred to below. A special case of informative features are the federal state and region codes. These are automatically assigned by the ClassiX® system when the corresponding localities are created and can be used in combination with the state codes to set the environment variables in the project-specific batch file.

For preventive maintenance, work plans can be assigned to the machines as maintenance plans. Based on these maintenance plans, maintenance orders (in the form of production orders) are created. All work created for a maintenance plan is recorded in the maintenance account of the machine. By means of the start date, the periodicity and the last work carried out, the system can then automatically determine in the maintenance module which maintenance orders are due next."

In order to be able to describe the dynamically created objects, their attributes and relationships, an ObjectCrawler is implemented with this module, which independently scans the database, collects, examines and categorises objects and stores this information as meta-description. These meta descriptions of the objects and their attributes and relationships can then be maintained here. Before starting the search, you must define the settings for the search, on which the speed and duration of the search depend. The following settings are available: Under the boundary conditions you can specify the maximum age of the meta-info. To speed up the search, meta-information is not overwritten and skipped if it is younger than the set date. Transaction splitting is used to specify after how many transactions (analyses of meta objects) the results are saved in the database. The maximum collection depth specifies how many elements of an M1, MN relation, or collection are analysed (if set to 0, all elements of a collection are searched). The maximum collection depth can significantly influence the duration of the crawling process, a value of 500, and 5 for very large databases, can lead to fast results. Equally important for the duration of the crawling process is the recursion depth parameter (-1 stands for infinite depth). The recursion depth determines how far the crawler should recursively examine the references of an object. Regardless of this setting, the ObjectCrawler always performs a width search, i.e. referenced objects are only examined after all siblings of an object have been examined. The last and most important option is the REP start index, which tells where the object crawler is located when searching the database. The crawler searches the database in such a way that it takes a single object from each REP and examines it to get a clear and meaningful picture of the database as quickly as possible. This so-called REP start index determines the current (start) index of this object extraction from the REPs. -1 lets the crawler take a random element from each REP, but if you want to do a full scan, you should start at 0 and observe the increment of this value to know where the crawler is at that moment. If this value exceeds the maximum length of a REP, the crawler is automatically stopped and you have thus scanned the entire REP. Under the runtime options you can limit the crawling duration of the object crawler. By default you let the crawler run until you stop it (the cancel button in the progressbar window closes the search with EndTXN and therefore the button is more a stop button than a cancel button) or until it is finished. You can stop the crawler automatically after the first run by selecting the option with the same name or only when the queue with all REP objects from the first run including their referenced objects is processed and empty by selecting the corresponding option Stop crawler when queue is empty. Depending on the selected option, you can control the behaviour in case of errors. In this sense, errors are not InstantView errors but logical consistency errors in the database. It is recommended to select the option Log error and continue. Under other settings you can define various options like: ObjectCrawler logging: all ObjectCrawler operations are written to separate log files. Process backreferences intelligently: if this option is selected, certain class checks are performed when examining backreferences to prevent errors.\n\n### Response:",

A common use of SQL is to output certain data fields (using the SELECT statement) from a table (specified with FROM) as a result list under certain conditions (specified with WHERE).

Then the contact data (business address, private address, ) is assigned to the desired fields in Outlook. This assignment can be made individually for each contact and will be used later for all synchronisation processes. As soon as there is a connection between the contacts, they can be synchronised at any time."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhat is the name of this module?\n\n### Context:\nAdvance requirements are used to cover real requirements that are generated at a later date. This is useful for parts with long replenishment lead times (planned delivery time or in-house production time). For this reason, preliminary requirements make no sense for e.g. level 0 parts within a sales order. You can create the corresponding order item directly and do not have to take the diversion via advance requirements. Therefore, preliminary requirements should only be created for MRP sub-items of a production BOM that has not yet been exploded and technically released as a whole, if the time between technical release and the required procurement date is shorter than the expected delivery time. However, the same can also apply to sub-items kept in stock, which have a very low minimum stock level, show high consumption and also have a relatively long delivery time. There you can use the advance requirements to reserve a certain number of parts in the warehouse before the actual disposition of the finally exploded parts list. The system only makes sense if the planned part is actually scheduled at a later point in time, i.e. can be offset. It therefore makes no sense to create an advance requirement for part X, whereby this part always occurs as a component of the higher-level and stock-keeping part Z, and this part Z is also ultimately planned. It makes just as little sense to create an advance requirement for a part that only appears in parts lists as a constructive (fictitious) item and is ultimately never manufactured and is therefore not planned. Advance requirements documents can be created in the course of planning. When creating a preliminary requirement, it is specified for which order and on which date how much goods are expected to be needed. A preliminary requirements document can contain several items. Only one - not completed, openly running - preliminary requirement can be triggered per order for each part. A scheduled advance requirement item (with a staging date) is posted in the MRP account as a requirement trigger (\"future issue\") and therefore leads to an increase in requirements for the corresponding part. The \"aim\" of the document is to reserve or procure the preplanned quantity in advance. Later, the respective advance requirement item is replaced by a \"real\" requirement trigger in the MRP account; this can be an order item or a part requirement item.\n\n### Response:",

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhat is the name of this module?\n\n### Context:\n2.1 Preset attribute A preset attribute allows a dynamic data field to be given a descriptive name, further explanatory data or a default setting. Example: A carpet seller with a ClassiX® software wants to describe his carpets by different characteristics. For example, all carpets should be described by their price. So he adds a characteristic to all master data, in which he can then specify the price. If individual carpets are to be described by their colour (no free input, only colours from a colour table should be available), he can do this by means of an attribute, which for example describes a data field of type 'String'. This attribute is then provided with a table with the different colours. Attention: Attribute values are only supported in the formulas up to a maximum of 100 characters! 2.2 Formula attributes As the name suggests, formula attributes are used to fill a data field with a formula, or with the value that the formula calculates. Constants can be entered directly into the formula while the variable values are slot attributes. Example: The carpet seller now wants to describe his carpets also by size, whereby the carpets have the characteristic that all carpets have the same width (4m) and differ only in length. Here the carpet seller benefits from the formula attributes. So he creates an attribute with the formula '4m * length'. The length is again a preset attribute, whereby the value or the result of the formula attribute changes automatically when the value is changed. 2.3 Conditional attributes Conditional attributes can contain a table that describes an \"if - then\" relationship. Example: The carpets of the carpet seller are to have their own price per colour. We now create a conditional attribute and fill the table with the data we need for the price calculation. (e.g.: red -> 10 € ; blue -> 20 € ; yellow -> 30€ ) In addition, we set our just created attribute in dependence of the attribute for the colour.(see example Preset attribute) If the attribute for the colour is changed, the corresponding value of the condition table is now automatically returned.\n\n### Response:",

Now, these goods can no longer be assigned to a particular goods receipt, but it must still be possible to return them to the supplier who most probably delivered this part. This is the function of the complaint document. This can be created directly for a stock removal or optionally also for a quality assurance document that has a stock removal as its predecessor. If the goods are expected back from the supplier, this can be activated with the checkbox \"Goods are expected back\", this complaint behaves like an order. The quantity is displayed in the dispatch account until the complete delivery. It may also be the case that the goods have been ready for some time at the customer and only then the customer discovers that the goods are defective and sends them back. In this case, there is the possibility to search for the original goods withdrawal document on the complaint document using the order number. A link to a goods withdrawal document is always advisable, as this is the only way to ensure that the material flow and cost distribution is 100% correct and remains traceable for later. Since a withdrawal document is not always available, for example in the case of Kanban or manual warehouse parts without warehouse management, it is also possible to attach the complaint document directly to an order header so that the flow of goods can be assigned at least to one order or cost object. The return loop is also fully integrated for this document, i.e. if a goods receipt is not perfect according to this complaint document, it is immediately sent back via a return document. The difference between the return document and the complaint document is The complaint document always refers to a goods removal The return document must refer to a goods receipt as a predecessor. The return document can therefore only be used if the disposition process of the part is not yet completed due to a QA or missing goods putaway or staging. If this process has already been completed, there is still the possibility to send the goods back via the complaint document. Business Process If no quality assurance document has been created for the removal from storage, the quantity made available is deducted from the parts requisition item/order item that may have been placed before the goods are removed. It can now be removed again via the staging list. If the goods receipt now arrives for an item that has already been made available in the meantime by another withdrawal, the status of the goods receipt changes to \"goods putaway\" and must be put away.

This results in further subtasks such as checking the invoice, making the initial account assignment and posting in the financial accounting. ClassiX® supports this process by an ergonomic, semi-automatic capture of the incoming invoice. By means of an automated check, which presents the invoices to be checked directly to the respective employees for checking, the time delay caused by transport and communication between the departments/employees involved is minimised.

This results in further subtasks such as checking the invoice, making the initial account assignment and posting in the financial accounting. ClassiX® supports this process by an ergonomic, semi-automatic capture of the incoming invoice. By means of an automated check, which presents the invoices to be checked directly to the respective employees for checking, the time delay caused by transport and communication between the departments/employees involved is minimised. Due to the assignment of the incoming invoice via the document history to the demand triggers, the initial account assignment is also carried out automatically. the posting to the financial accounting is carried out via the invoice receipt book."

The third field contains the operator for a string comparison, the fourth field contains the comparison string. The two conditions are automatically linked with 'and'. The fifth field contains a CX_VALUE as result, which is returned if the whole condition is fulfilled. The middle area shows the objects that are currently in the plugspace. Here you can add and remove any objects. Only the data fields 'int' and 'str' have to be set, because they are used for comparison with the conditions. In the lower area, various methods of the class can now be checked by simply pressing the corresponding buttons. The respective result is displayed in the list between the buttons, or can also result in an error message. The checkboxes below can be used to control which flags should be set. The exact effect of these can be found in the documentation for CX_CONDITIONED_BAG. The 'BindMessage' check box controls whether a message is defined for error handling or not."

Garbage Collection Each module tests an invariant value for immutability - i.e. protection against garbage collection - while all modules intentionally produce a lot of stack data. Reload modules There are three different implementations for the Beta module, but they all respond to the messages sent by the main programme. From time to time, the current version for module beta is replaced by one of the others in random order. The test runs endlessly, so it is intended for a longer runtime. As soon as an error is detected, an error message appears. At the same time, a log file is created in the directory where the ClassiX® application was started. This allows to follow the test procedure and possible errors are recorded. // This module performs all actions in random order, thus we may detect errors // that occur under certain conditions only. // These actions are: // sending message ALFA, BETA, or GAMMA // sending message CLOSE_WINx with (x = A, B, C) // reloading module Beta with different implementations (1 - 3) // // Actions and errors are written into file MSGTEST.LOG // // // This test routine covers the following basic functionality: // // - Corrent Message Passing // Sended and received messages are counted and checked. // Window objects check arrival of messages according to parent-child-hierachy. // CURRENT / NON_CURRENT received by any module are tested to arrive in proper sequence // // - Garbage Collection // To detect possible errors in garbage collection, invariant values are repeatedly checked and // all modules produce deliberately lots of garbage. // // - Reloading of Modules // Module Beta is frequently reloaded, chosing arbitrarily among there are 3 different implementations. //.\n\n### Response:",

        "output": "The module qm_message_qm can be described as follows: This routine tests the following functions and tries to detect errors: Message Passing Sent and received messages are counted and the counters are compared. CURRENT / NON_CURRENT for the modules is monitored and it is tested whether the messages received from window objects arrive according to the parent-child hierarchy. Garbage Collection Each module tests an invariant value for immutability - i.e. protection against garbage collection - while all modules intentionally produce a lot of stack data. Reload modules There are three different implementations for the Beta module, but they all respond to the messages sent by the main programme. From time to time, the current version for module beta is replaced by one of the others in random order. The test runs endlessly, so it is intended for a longer runtime. As soon as an error is detected, an error message appears. At the same time, a log file is created in the directory where the ClassiX® application was started. This allows to follow the test procedure and possible errors are recorded. // This module performs all actions in random order, thus we may detect errors // that occur under certain conditions only. // These actions are: // sending message ALFA, BETA, or GAMMA // sending message CLOSE_WINx with (x = A, B, C) // reloading module Beta with different implementations (1 - 3) // // Actions and errors are written into file MSGTEST.LOG // // // This test routine covers the following basic functionality: // // - Corrent Message Passing // Sended and received messages are counted and checked. // Window objects check arrival of messages according to parent-child-hierachy. // CURRENT / NON_CURRENT received by any module are tested to arrive in proper sequence // // - Garbage Collection // To detect possible errors in garbage collection, invariant values are repeatedly checked and // all modules produce deliberately lots of garbage. // // - Reloading of Modules // Module Beta is frequently reloaded, chosing arbitrarily among there are 3 different implementations. //."

These are the bills of materials which are generated by the system by exploding master bills of materials, taking into account the characteristics and their values specified from a customer order, warehouse order or advance requirement. The term \"explosion\" refers to the selection of entries from, for example, variant parts list items or the calculation of quantities and/or characteristic values. As a special feature it should be noted that in the so-called tree view of the parts list, the calculated total quantity is displayed for each parts list entry, although only individual quantities are entered. If you change a quantity on any level in the parts list, all quantities on the levels below are automatically updated, i.e. multiplied out and the required total quantities are displayed. Normally, ClassiX® assumes that at least a \"rough\" variant bill of material is defined for each part in the system. This avoids having to define and enter a separate master bill of material for each special case in advance. Within the scope of technical processing and design, this order-specific exploded production bill of materials is then adapted or designed more precisely with regard to parts, characteristic values and quantities. The changes are then only valid for the respective order item. To quickly create new parts lists, it is possible to drag a part from the parts master into the production parts list structure using the mouse. This way only the quantity needs to be adjusted and if necessary the new item needs to be exploded (if it is an assembly - red gear symbol!). In principle, however, it is also possible to completely redefine the order-specific production parts list. Note: If, for example, within an order-specific production bill of materials - which was exploded or generated from a \"standard\" bill of materials - somewhere on a lower structural level, one part is exchanged for another part, then this production bill of materials no longer \"matches\" the original \"standard\" bill of materials. Basically, this is then also a completely new assembly, in general terms, all higher-level parts have been redefined as a result - although they still have their original part number in this production bill of materials. This procedure should therefore only be used in order to be able to quickly and pragmatically comply with any customer request for (simple) \"exotic\" parts (e.g. exchanging the screws for other screw heads). As the production parts lists are retained in the system, it is always possible to trace what has been installed where: However, the order itself must always be queried in the system. It is therefore recommended to make changes to production BOMs only for variant parts (the \"uniqueness\" of the BOM is anyway only ensured by the characteristic values defined in the order) and possibly to mark a characteristic of such parts with a version. Attention: Due to changes in the production bill of materials, it can happen that the routing of the parent part no longer matches the current production bill of materials. In order to be able to find out these items, there is an item\"Display number of entries (production bill of material/master bill of material)\" in the view options in the menu \"Edit\".

In its simplest form, it is just a designation for a combination of other articles. Although a sales set is a part roll, it is the only part roll that does not need to be related to a part. For example, if the combination of the sales articles - the sales set itself - is stocked, it must be assigned to a part (consisting of the combined parts). For example, a spare parts set would be a sales set consisting of different spare parts.

The possible packaging (bag, sack, carton) of a sales set can be assigned to the part of the sales set as a parts list, accordingly the compilation of a set can be assigned to the part of the sales set as a routing. A special form of the sales set is the assembly set, whose individual parts are directly processed as a parts list.Conditional individual parts in sets Conditional individual parts can be included in sets.

Such service call objects can be created e.g. directly from an industrial plant - this should be the origin of the customer's problem - whereby the customer, the plant and the plant group are automatically taken over. The core functionality of this module is that for each service call the employee who is to take care of the service call can be directly assigned. For this purpose, the employee can be assigned his capacity by first selecting the employee concerned via the employee list and then opening the capacity planning via the menu item \"Edit->Set->Capacity planning\". The service call also has an automatic planning function: the determination button on the position can determine an employee who can be deployed or a free period of time based on the data entered so far on the position. On the one hand, it is possible to specify a working group (field Provider) and a planning date with duration on the position. The button then determines the first member of the working group who has the specified capacity (duration) at the specified time. If no working group is specified, all employees of the employee master data are searched. On the other hand, the planning date can also be determined if this is emptied and then an employee is selected. The button then determines when the employee has the planned duration of capacity available and enters the date automatically. If no freelancer or free capacity is found, the mask will not be filled in. Step 1: Setting the employee capacity The system now knows how much working time can be planned for this employee. Step 2: Planning of requirements Via the editing mask of the industrial plants, in the tab \"Plant groups\", a plant group can now be selected and on it the menu item \"Create service call\" can be chosen. A new document, the service call, is created. The plant group and the customer from the industrial plant are immediately transferred to it. In the new mask, the description of what the service call was about can now be entered, for example the error description that the customer gave over the phone. At this point, neither an offer nor an order has been created. After entering the description, the document is first saved by pressing the \"OK\" button. As soon as it is now clear that the service call is to be carried out and bindingly scheduled, sub-items can be inserted on which the date (planned date), the planned duration and an employee must be specified. A new project and a new order is created in the background with a plant group and a service provider group. The service provider group is displayed as a sub-item of the service call. The data entered here are immediately booked into the employee requirement and can be found as planned requirements in its capacity planning.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nHow is this module called?\n\n### Context:\nThis app is used to display parts consumption. It shows which quantities of one or more parts have been consumed in an adjustable period of time. This app is intended as an aid for logistics. Related to this are the apps Parts Usage (intended for use by technology) and Parts Usage (intended for use by service/sales). If you generally want to evaluate the use or non-use of a part in a certain period, you can do this by means of an inspection run.In addition to the output of the list with the parts with consumption in the selected period, the complementary list with the parts without consumption in this period is always output in parallel. The following movements are referred to as part consumption:Goods receipts that have not been put away (MRP goods receipt)Production order items that have not been put away (dispositive production). Outsourcing The parts are selected by means of the part selection window, which opens after pressing the toolbar button or the \"Select parts\" button or simply dragged and dropped into the list. With drag&drop, parts rolls are also accepted.By selecting/restricting the staging types of the parts (MRP parts, stock parts, etc.), you can control which parts consumption (goods receipts, MRP production, stock removals) is taken into account in the evaluation. If, for example, only stock parts are selected (staging types: warehouse management, manual stock, remaining quantity, Kanban, own provision of stock), then the planned parts consumption is not included in the evaluation. As a side effect, the list of \"parts without consumption\" also provides a so-called list of slow-moving items. The total consumption of a part results from the sum of the above movements. The evaluation of the total consumption is done according to the following logic: If an incoming invoice has been issued for these goods in the selected period, the price is taken from this invoice and multiplied by the total sales quantity. If no incoming invoice has been created, the system searches for other documents and uses their price for the calculation. When posting the above-mentioned documents, they are entered in the parts transaction file in relation to goods receipt or production - each subdivided into year and month. The corresponding quantities are registered here. Thus, when creating the parts consumption, only the parts operation files of the individual document types have to be fetched and the quantities compiled from them. An exception to this is the removal from storage. Here the quantities are not collected in the parts procedure folder, but in the warehouse statistics. This can be accessed via the warehouse account of the part. A record is created in the list for each part and for each period with consumption, unless the part does not have an operation folder. (For more on this, see the options window)Parts without consumption are listed in the tab \"Parts without consumption\". A double click opens the stock movement window for the clicked period. Attention! Validity is not taken into account in part consumption, i.e. consumption across exchange objects is not displayed! Attention (only companies with separate client turnover)! If the option \"Split variant parts\" is set via the options window, the split display is incorrectly displayed for clients whose material logistics are not separated according to domains/company codes. The total sum of all variant part characteristics is displayed behind each characteristic of a variant part. This is also not possible to separate subsequently, as the conditions for this are defined solely in the transaction descriptions. (What is consumption of one company, what is consumption of the other?) Attention! If a part is marked as \"constructive assembly\", it is not displayed as \"consumption\"! From the dispo account , the parts consumption statistics can be accessed via the \"Parts consumption\" group. If this way is chosen, the consumption of the last 12 months is displayed in the list, whereby the displayed filter remains on the currently valid period. So if you simply use the \"Create statistics\" icon, only the current month will be displayed. The variant filter possibly transferred via the dispo account must also be taken into account: If the statistics from the MRP account were called up after double-clicking on the MRP list with split variants, the statistics will only display the turnovers of the transferred characteristic. To delete the filter, click on the toolbar button \"Reset list and delete variant filter \".\n\n### Response:",

Related to this are the apps Parts Usage (intended for use by technology) and Parts Usage (intended for use by service/sales). If you generally want to evaluate the use or non-use of a part in a certain period, you can do this by means of an inspection run.In addition to the output of the list with the parts with consumption in the selected period, the complementary list with the parts without consumption in this period is always output in parallel. The following movements are referred to as part consumption:Goods receipts that have not been put away (MRP goods receipt)Production order items that have not been put away (dispositive production). Outsourcing The parts are selected by means of the part selection window, which opens after pressing the toolbar button or the \"Select parts\" button or simply dragged and dropped into the list. With drag&drop, parts rolls are also accepted.By selecting/restricting the staging types of the parts (MRP parts, stock parts, etc.), you can control which parts consumption (goods receipts, MRP production, stock removals) is taken into account in the evaluation. If, for example, only stock parts are selected (staging types: warehouse management, manual stock, remaining quantity, Kanban, own provision of stock), then the planned parts consumption is not included in the evaluation. As a side effect, the list of \"parts without consumption\" also provides a so-called list of slow-moving items. The total consumption of a part results from the sum of the above movements. The evaluation of the total consumption is done according to the following logic: If an incoming invoice has been issued for these goods in the selected period, the price is taken from this invoice and multiplied by the total sales quantity. If no incoming invoice has been created, the system searches for other documents and uses their price for the calculation. When posting the above-mentioned documents, they are entered in the parts transaction file in relation to goods receipt or production - each subdivided into year and month. The corresponding quantities are registered here. Thus, when creating the parts consumption, only the parts operation files of the individual document types have to be fetched and the quantities compiled from them. An exception to this is the removal from storage. Here the quantities are not collected in the parts procedure folder, but in the warehouse statistics. This can be accessed via the warehouse account of the part. A record is created in the list for each part and for each period with consumption, unless the part does not have an operation folder. (For more on this, see the options window)Parts without consumption are listed in the tab \"Parts without consumption\". A double click opens the stock movement window for the clicked period. Attention! Validity is not taken into account in part consumption, i.e. consumption across exchange objects is not displayed! Attention (only companies with separate client turnover)! If the option \"Split variant parts\" is set via the options window, the split display is incorrectly displayed for clients whose material logistics are not separated according to domains/company codes. The total sum of all variant part characteristics is displayed behind each characteristic of a variant part. This is also not possible to separate subsequently, as the conditions for this are defined solely in the transaction descriptions. (What is consumption of one company, what is consumption of the other?) Attention! If a part is marked as \"constructive assembly\", it is not displayed as \"consumption\"! From the dispo account , the parts consumption statistics can be accessed via the \"Parts consumption\" group. If this way is chosen, the consumption of the last 12 months is displayed in the list, whereby the displayed filter remains on the currently valid period. So if you simply use the \"Create statistics\" icon, only the current month will be displayed. The variant filter possibly transferred via the dispo account must also be taken into account: If the statistics from the MRP account were called up after double-clicking on the MRP list with split variants, the statistics will only display the turnovers of the transferred characteristic. To delete the filter, click on the toolbar button \"Reset list and delete variant filter \"."
