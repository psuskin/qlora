These can be restored at any time (see "Apply") if the test characteristics have been changed by various tests and, for example, the conditional positions no longer produce a result.InsertOpens the list of all features that can be inserted from hereRemoveDeletes the currently selected attribute from the listTo be observed:Each change to a test feature is saved.
