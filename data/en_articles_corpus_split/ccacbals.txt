ccacbals: With this module, the costs accrued on cost centres can be listed. On the one hand, the costs are displayed for the selected posting period (the so-called period costs), on the other hand they are cumulated from the beginning of the fiscal year belonging to the posting period up to the specified accrual period or optionally up to the end of the corresponding fiscal year. A further option enables the additional output of the cost elements posted per cost centre. A difference line is output if the total of these cost centre/cost element postings does not match the total costs posted to the cost centre. Costs are posted from financial accounting to the cost centres. Since these postings may also be posted to a cost object at the same time, these values are displayed separately (see columns "thereof with cost object"). One has the possibility to separate especially the revenue postings (=negative costs) from the other "net" costs (see"net" columns). A double click on a list entry navigates - if period values exist - directly to a list of postings, otherwise to an overview of the period balances of the selected fiscal year. By using the right mouse button you always reach the overview of the period balances of the selected account in the selected fiscal year. Module name: ccacbals.mod. Classes: CX_COST_CENTER.
