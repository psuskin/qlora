sstgroup: The sales statistics groups take over the functions of advance account assignment to cost types/goods accounts and the definition of article group discounts. This is made possible by the fact that they are assigned to the sales roles via the evaluation group "sales statistics" (SALES_STATISTICS). Definition of article group discounts: As described in the sales pricing overview, discounts or surcharges can be defined for a group of articles. This group must be linked via the "Sales Statistics" (SALES_STATISTICS) or at least have a common node. If an article is dragged into an order item, the system searches for a discount or surcharge via the statistics group assigned to it or a higher node and then transfers this to the item.
