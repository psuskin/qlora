autopcal: In the stock/requirements overview you can clearly see when material bottlenecks occur for selected parts. For each calendar week in the specified period, colour-coded boxes indicate whether sufficient material is available to cover requirements. This evaluation is also available as a stock/requirements list in a detailed list view. List window: Bitmaps in the list If one or more items are marked in the list and the button "Create new order" is pressed, these marked items will be sorted by the main suppliers of the parts. So the main supplier (A-supplier) of the part is used for the price determination of the parts. If no supplier has been entered for a part, the price defined by default in the order item role is used. For more information on pricing, see here. Module name: autopcal.mod. Classes: CX_ITEM.
