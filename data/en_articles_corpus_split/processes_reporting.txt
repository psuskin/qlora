processes_reporting. Introduction: Reports are the compilation of operational information, usually in the form of a list (e.g. a list of all orders that have not yet been delivered or only partially delivered). They can be created for internal or external use. The information can be passed on through various media, so reports can be produced in paper or electronic form. A report is usually different from a document that is used to output a receipt. An example is the output of an order confirmation, an invoice, etc. by letter (paper) or e.g. also as a PDF attachment to an email. Call: ClassiXÂ® offers various evaluations, such as the order cost evaluation. This is already a report, but cannot be output without a defined report. For the output of reports, a list is always necessary, which represents the data basis of the report. Thus the result of the order cost evaluation is a list with all information. However, a report can also be created using simple lists, such as the order list in the corresponding selection mask. This button, which is usually located in the toolbar, is used to call up the reporting module. {img type="fileId" fileId="302" thumb="box" width="100%"} Using the "Clipboard" tab, a list as it is displayed in the calling window can be copied and then pasted into a text file or Excel, for example. The "Reports" tab can be used to create and print reports based on a database. Either the list from the calling window or an internal list defined especially for the report serves as a database. It is also possible for the report to define its own database. Whether this is the case can be seen from the report symbol. Normal' report. Report with its own database.
