ProfilingCluster: Example of an XML export Notes The log of a profiling run can be clustered using a tool. For this purpose Profiling.bat has to be started (in //iv/main/Inst/Profiling). Prerequisite is an installed Java 1.4. The tool asks for the file name with the profiling log and then starts the analysis. At the end the run is confirmed with a message. The result is stored in an HTML file, which can be further processed with Excel, for example.
