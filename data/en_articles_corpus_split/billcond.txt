billcond: A conditional BOM item of a bill of material contains a conditional list of individual BOM items, the so-called variants. This provides a tool for defining different parts in a BOM item, e.g. due to different characteristics of the part to be produced. Different quantity specifications can also be stored in an individual bill of material item as a table. In the course of a bill of material explosion, the item whose condition is fulfilled first is inserted into the production bill of material. Attention: See also special features of conditional tables. Input window: This window is used to maintain conditional BOM items. Module name: alloccon.mod. Classes: CX_CONDITIONED_ALLOCATION.
