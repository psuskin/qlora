cheqregi: This module is used to manage cheques received in specially set up entry books. Received cheques can be entered (status: received), open items assigned, posted in a second step in the financial accounting (status: posted) and a list can be printed as a deposit form for the bank (status: deposited). This module is used particularly in countries (e.g. USA) where payments by cheque are widespread. Outgoing cheques are created and printed in the payment run . Input window: This window is used to record and further process received cheques. First, received checks are entered, which are then displayed in the list of received checks. In a second step, received checks are transferred to financial accounting, giving them the status "posted". These posted checks also remain in the list of checks received. As a last step, the cheques booked are submitted to one of our own house banks. In the system, these cheques are marked as "deposited", which means that they then move from the list of received cheques to the list of deposited cheques. Booking window: This window is used to list all incoming books of checks stored in the system. List window: This window is used to list all incoming books of checks stored in the system.
