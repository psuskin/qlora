offorcal. Description: After an order item has been created, the basic conditions that led to the price and cost formation can change. For example, there may have been changes in the master data (the price of steel, for example, changes almost daily) or attribute changes in higher items which affect the price of the subitem. In order to send the quotation/order to the customer with the current correct prices, you have the possibility to check the prices/costs of all items via this service. Price comparison for sets: For sets, there is a special feature when comparing costs if the set is of type 1 or 2 ("individual costs are ignored"). With this type, the costs are defined directly as a set. When comparing prices, the costs that would result from the master data of the subitems are now compared with the costs set in the set. Comparison pricing: This window serves to compare the detailed pricing in the offer/order item and the master data. Here not only the total sums are compared, but also the individual increase/decrease prices and surcharges/discounts. Module name: offorcal.mod. Classes: -.
