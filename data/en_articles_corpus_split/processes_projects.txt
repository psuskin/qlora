processes_projects. Flow definition: The functions of the MS Project interface are designed for the following process: A comparison of the data from ClassiX® into an already existing MS Project file is not planned, because the definition of the project planning process assumes that the rough planning is basically done in MS Project and that ClassiX® will only use it as a starting point for your own detailed planning. This results in the necessity of a powerful reconciliation function, which updates the data in ClassiX®, but not the other way round. However, due to these assumptions, there are some cases where no automatic matching can be performed. These are briefly listed below, together with their causes: A detailed documentation of the various messages and symbols can be found in the documentation of the cost unit.
