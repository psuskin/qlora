cxWorkTimeModel: Working time models can be created and assigned for employees and cost centres. Events are used to define the working times within a working time model.They determine, for example, when the working day begins and ends and when or how long the breaks are.By means of these working time models defined in this way, the capacity of the employee can be automatically determined and saved for a defined period of time in capacity planning. The system then recognises, for example, that the employee works 8 hours on Mondays and Tuesdays, but only 7 hours on Fridays.In order for capacity planning to take these working times into account, the employee must be assigned to a time rule that refers to the "capacity planning rule". This is specified on the time rule or directly on the employee if the employee does not clock in and the working time model is only to be used for his capacity planning.{img fileId="519"}.
