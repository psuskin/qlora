favourit: In the favourites window you can collect all the objects you want to have quick access to. These can be sorted and managed in subfolders, e.g. frequently used contacts or telephone numbers. All objects can be sorted here by drag & drop into the tree. In addition, you can also create telephone numbers that cannot be directly assigned to a person or that you just need to note down quickly. For all elements in the tree you can also enter extra data, such as a descriptive comment. In addition to the management of favourites, all functions are combined here to export ClassiXÂ® contacts, e.g. to Microsoft Outlook. General: The main window with the favourites. Here the folder structure with the contained objects is displayed and all other functions are made available via menu and toolbar. {img type="fileId" fileId="394" thumb="box" width="100%"} The favourites window.

Folder: With the help of the freely createable folders, objects such as customers can be arranged in personal groups. A customer can be assigned to any number of these folders.
