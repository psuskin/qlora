appsWHModuleSynchronise: The AppsWarehouse® Module Synchronisation App determines the loaded modules of the current ClassiX® instance and lists them against a total overview of all files in the corresponding folders in the file system. A graphical indication shows which files have been loaded as modules by the system and which have not. On this basis, excess files and modules can be identified and the corresponding files simply deleted. In addition, the synchronisation app offers the option of opening files directly for closer examination. List window: This window is used to list the file directories, the modules loaded in the current ClassiX® instance and all files in the respective (sub)directories. By default, all directories are preselected after each call of the synchronisation app. If one or more directories are selected in the upper list, the lower two list displays for the loaded modules and the files are restricted to the selected directories. The files selected in the bottom list can be deleted and opened using the action buttons. Implementation: The AppsWarehouse® Module Alignment App fetches all loaded modules via and determines the path and the name of the modules in the data system. In addition, all files of the determined folders are retrieved via and displayed. To indicate which files are (not) used in the current ClassiX® instance, the file list is compared with the loaded modules - path and file name must match. The path equality check is already carried out implicitly when loading all files via the path supplied by the module. File names are then explicitly checked for equality.
