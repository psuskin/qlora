cxPattItemNumber: Specifications are automatically generated by the system if variant parts for which there is no distinct sub-part are to be booked into the warehouse as surplus or remaining quantity. The specifications save the characteristics of the variant part and the standard costs for the specification. This enables the automatic use of these quantities in parts planning and the warehouse value calculation in inventory and warehouse statistics. Input window: This window is used to maintain .
