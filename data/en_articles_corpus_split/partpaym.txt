partpaym: Payment plan conditions can be used to define partial payments (payment plan amounts) in both sales and purchasing. Each partial payment is defined by the amount and the date (event).Since payment plans are transaction-specific data, the master conditions only serve as a reference. When inserting the condition into an order, for example, the condition is copied here and thus always inserted locally.Payment schedules, when used in a document, can trigger an event such as the down payment request. This makes this condition different from all others. Input window: The input window is used to edit the master payment plans, which serve as a template for documents, and local payment plans. List window: Used to list the payment plans. Selection window: This window is used to select a payment plan. Module name: partpaym.mod. Classes: CX_PARTIAL_PAYMENT.
