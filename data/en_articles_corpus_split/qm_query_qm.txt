qm_query_qm: This module tests everything that has to do with queries and indexes for correct function. A sample database with various personal data is used for this. Normal queries can be tested with the input mask, where you can search the database according to any criteria. Just enter a search value in a field and press Enter. You can also edit the database by simply selecting a record, making the changes at the top of the screen and then clicking the 'save' button. Under the menu item 'Test' there are various instructions for creating and removing an index of certain parts of the database. Here you can also create and remove an index with Retrieve and test the explicit tracking with Call(BreakLink) and Call(MakeLink). Finally, this menu also contains functions with PrePostUpdate. The menu item 'more Queries.' opens a new window, which allows queries with retrieve and index update with the PrePostUpdate function UniqueIDIndexMaint(). The buttons 'A', 'B' etc. contain ready-made queries with which the PrePostUpdate function can be tested. Under the item 'Manager.' you will find the Query Manager, which can display all cached queries in detail. With 'Query Functions' you can create an overview of all query functions and the 'Index Manager' is the last point to manage all created indexes. Module name: reload_qm.mod.
