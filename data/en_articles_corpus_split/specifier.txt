specifier: With this application you can create, make persistent and then maintain prefixes (specifiers). One must be aware that only persistent specifiers can and may be changed. Therefore, you have to create a transient specifier at runtime and make it persistent before you can change it. Transient specifiers of the ClassiXÂ® system, i.e. specifiers that are loaded from the *.DIC and *.INI files when the system is started, must neither be changed nor made persistent. Once created and made persistent, Specifiers can no longer be deleted. Specifiers that have been created and made transient cannot be deleted either, but they will not be present the next time the system is started. Making specifiers persistent can only be done from the list window, this is a security measure. For example, if you have created several transient specifiers and don't want to keep one of them, you can make the specifiers you want to keep persistent, restart the system and then only the persisted specifiers will be available. The created transient specifier will no longer be displayed. List window: This list shows all prefixes available in the system. Selection window: This window is used to select a prefix.
