cxWorkTimeYear: In addition to the calendar for financial years for financial accounting, asset accounting and cost accounting, as well as the company calendar, a working time calendar can be maintained for recording and maintaining absences (holidays, sick days) and working hours with flexitime. The maintenance of the working time calendars is usually the responsibility of the personnel department. Input window: This window is used to maintain a working time calendar. After a working time calendar has been created (see the description of the fields), the periods must then be generated. The total period of the working time calendar should completely cover the periods of the individual periods. If the periods correspond to the calendar months, they can be generated automatically (see menu item "Generate periods automatically: months"), otherwise please create the sub-periods individually. In the sub-periods you must also set the status of a period to be posted to 'started'. You can edit one of the created periods by double-clicking on it. A working time calendar and its specific period may only be defined once in the system. Within a working time calendar, an exactly identical period may also not be contained more than once. If periods overlap, only a warning is issued. List window: Used to list the working time calendar year periods. Selection window: This window is used to select a year object in the working time calendar. Module name: cxWorkTimeYear.mod. Classes: CX_WORK_TIME_YEAR.
