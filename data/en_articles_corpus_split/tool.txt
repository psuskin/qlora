tool: Tools are defined in the CyberEnterprise® enterprise model as a part role. This means that tools can also have other parts roles, such as order or production roles, or be managed as assets in the asset master. They can also be kept in stock. The part assigned to a tool is called equipment and is also managed separately in the parts master. In contrast, in the CyberEnterprise® Enterprise Model, machines and vehicles(cars and trucks) are considered as special characteristics of parts themselves.
