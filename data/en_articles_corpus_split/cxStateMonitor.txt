cxStateMonitor: Status monitors indicate the current processing status of documents.Thus, an order item is first in the status "Created" after creation. After the sales release, it changes to the status "Design check". The designers now find this order item in their lists and can examine and technically release this order item, whereby it changes to the next processing status (explode bill of materials).In order to teach the system when a change from one state to the next should take place, there are the transition descriptions. Calculation formulas are stored here, which are evaluated at the time the documents are posted. Input window: This window is used to maintain states. You can select a state by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, then you can select the menu item "Search". If you select a transition to another state in this input window and then click on it with the right mouse button, you jump directly into this next state, the corresponding possibly other business process also opens!. <a0>List window</a0>: Used to list the states. <a0>Selection window</a0>: This window is used to select a state. <a0>Approval window</a0>.: Viewing and editing the approval status.
