invcontr: In this window you can get a quick overview of the current stock levels, the stock level of the last or the annual inventory. Functionality: You should first set the desired options via menu item and then select the warehouses or storage bins (button Search). The value of the warehouse will then be displayed. If you want to know how the value is composed, you can expand the view of the warehouse by simply clicking on the arrow. To see the whole stock you can also click on the button "Expand"; everything will be expanded immediately. Various display options are available here. With the menu item 'Edit - Select warehouse/storage location' or by clicking on the button 'Search' you can call up the current list of the individual warehouses, which can be broken down to each storage location. By marking the warehouses/storage bins to be valuated and selecting them via the 'OK'-button, the topmost storage level is displayed in the stock list/valuation, which you can expand or collapse with the buttons 'Expand' or 'Collapse'.
