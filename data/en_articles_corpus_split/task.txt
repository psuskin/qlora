task: Besides digital circulars (= notification) and requests (= planning), work orders (= processing) are the third pillar for the execution of tasks. Work orders are used to reserve time capacities of employees for a project. They can be created as follow-up documents for groups of service providers, or on their own without a connection to a cost unit. The (reserved) times entered via the work orders then appear in the capacity utilisation of the employee or his work group specified there, provided that it was also specified on the document. List window: This window is used to list the work orders. Selection window: This window is used to select a work order. Option window: All settings for the search can be made here.
