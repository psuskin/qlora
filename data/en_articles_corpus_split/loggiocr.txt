loggiocr: With this module, bookings on accounts payable are listed. The list of vendor postings is called up either for a single posting period or for all postings within a fiscal year. In the latter case, the current balance is output as a separate column - if sorted according to the column "Counter". This module is called up from the module for displaying the financial accounting balances of a general or personal account. List window: The preset sorting of the displayed postings is correct according to the column "Counter", the current, internal and therefore unique number of a financial accounting document. If, from the module for displaying the financial accounting balances of a G/L or subledger account, different periods of a fiscal year are selected one after the other by double-clicking, the postings of the respective period are displayed in the list without removing the postings of the previously selected periods from the list. If, on the other hand, the bookings of a whole year are called up, the list is emptied beforehand and behind the "Credit" column a new column "Current balance" can be seen, which shows the course of the balance of the bookings of the whole year - sorted according to the "Counter" column (see above). The penultimate column "Cleared" shows the date on which the entry was removed from the open item account. In the list of bookings a context menu can be called up with the following selection (by right mouse button). Module name: loggiocr.mod. Classes: CX_TRANSACTION.
