ctacbals: With this module the costs accrued on cost elements can be listed. On the one hand, the costs are displayed for the selected posting period (the so-called period costs), on the other hand they are cumulated from the beginning of the fiscal year belonging to the posting period up to the specified accrual period or optionally up to the end of the corresponding fiscal year. Costs can be posted to cost elements via financial accounting, via cost/service postings and via goods storage or removal. When goods are placed into or removed from storage or retrieved from a cost centre, they are only posted to the allocation cost element for storage stored in the client. A further option enables the additional output of the cost centres booked per cost type. A difference line is output if the total of these cost element/cost centre postings does not match the total costs posted to the cost element. In the special output form in the style of a company accounting sheet (BAB), the costs of the individual cost elements are also output per line, but the costs related to each cost element and cost centre are shown as columns of the individual line. A double click on a list entry navigates - if period values exist - directly to a list of postings, otherwise to an overview of the period balances of the selected fiscal year. By using the right mouse button you always reach the overview of the period balances of the selected account in the selected fiscal year. Module name: ctacbals.mod. Classes: CX_COST_TYPE.
