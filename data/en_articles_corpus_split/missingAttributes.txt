missingAttributes: If a formula or condition is to be calculated/resolved in ClassiX and variables (usually attributes) are missing, the user can query them in this window. This may be the case, for example, if a variant part or a conditional bill of material is to be exploded and not all attributes are specified. This query is only made at the time the condition/formula is resolved. The attribute values entered here are not written off, but only taken into account for the one-time resolution. Therefore, it is usually recommended to leave this window via "Cancel" and rather add the missing attributes to the document. Functionality: This window is used to record the variables. Module name: dynbind.mod. Classes: CX_ATTRIBUTE.
