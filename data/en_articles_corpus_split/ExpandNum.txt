ExpandNum: This module offers the possibility to elegantly extend enumerations in the classix.num or the corresponding customer derivation. New entries are read in from a file to be selected, compared with the existing entries so that no entry is created twice, supplemented with a unique number and sorted alphabetically. A new file is then created, the content of which is the complete definition of the enumeration of the selected data field. This block must now be copied and pasted into the selected num. Please make sure to delete the old definition from the num or replace the old definition with the new one. An Excel file or a simple text file is accepted as source file. If the file is an Excel file, the column in which the enumeration entries to be read must also be specified. Input window: This window offers the possibility to compare or read in enumeratin entries. See the description. ExpandNum: ExpandNum.mod.
