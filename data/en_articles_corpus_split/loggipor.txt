loggipor. Description: On the one hand, this app is used to check/display order items in a certain status (e.g. to evaluate the order commitment), but it is also used to select order items in order to transfer them to the goods receipts, for example. Accordingly, items from supplier and/or customer complaints can also be included in the evaluation. Both document types can lead to a goods receipt and can therefore be included here. Functionality: The order items recorded in the system can be listed according to a wide variety of criteria. Module name: loggipor.mod. Classes: -. Security: In addition to restricting access rights via the class and its data fields, the module can be restricted in its use via some of the received messages.
