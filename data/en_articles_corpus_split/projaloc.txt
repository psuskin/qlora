projaloc: At the time of an initial, rough planning of a project, the required resources (parts, workstations, machines, work groups or work areas) can be reserved here. Each of these target reservations is assigned to a project node (milestone) and a statistics group. The actual data arising in the course of order processing are then in turn compared to these target values in the statistics evaluation via the assignment to the project node and the statistics group. Functionality: This window is used to maintain project related resource reservations. Module name: projaloc.mod. Classes: CX_PROJECT_ALLOCATION.
