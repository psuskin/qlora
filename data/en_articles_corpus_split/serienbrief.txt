serienbrief. Procedure: The 'Recipients' tab takes you to the list of recipients. With the button 'Insert' you can add as many recipients as you like. At the same time, the corresponding process folders are automatically entered in the lower list so that the mailing campaign is also archived. Please note that for letters and faxes the Word document on the first tab always shows only the first recipient, even if the process is opened later from another process folder. However, all recipients are always taken into account when printing or sending. In order to print the letter or send the fax, please click on the corresponding button at the top of the toolbar. Here in the print preview you can check all recipient data. You can send an e-mail directly with the @-button or alternatively open it again in Outlook with the corresponding button. ClassiXÂ® always creates e-mails in Rich Text Format. If you want to send in another format, you have to open the e-mail in Outlook and change the format manually.
