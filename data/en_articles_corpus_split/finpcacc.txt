finpcacc: Personal accounts, i.e. customers, suppliers, employees and commission recipients (representatives) form so-called sub-ledgers in financial accounting. The connection to the general ledger of the financial accounting and thus to the balance sheet accounts of the classes receivables and payables are determined in CyberEnterpriseÂ® from the partner functions via the field reconciliation account. Normally, such an allocation to the control account remains unchanged, but if, for example, a previous supplier is bought by the own company, the control account must be changed from "trade payables" to "payables to affiliated companies" from this specific date. Another example is when a country is admitted to the European Union, then the reconciliation accounts of the person holding accounts from this country could change from e.g. "Foreign receivables" to "EU receivables". The totals and balance lists of debtors, creditors, employees and commission recipients (representatives) can also be called up via the respective reconciliation account, at the same time checking whether the balance of the reconciliation account matches the total of the person accounts assigned to the reconciliation account.This app is used, on the one hand, to make such a change to a reconciliation account of a person holding account, and, on the other hand, to make a posting - otherwise not permitted - between reconciliation accounts.
