Back from customer: The creation of return documents / credit notes in the host system means that credited stocks are immediately booked as warehouse stock. Therefore, the use of the HESTIA WMS function "Return from customer" does not trigger any stock postings in the host system. The host system posts to the "Available" warehouse by default. It makes sense to define in the company into which warehouse customer returns are to be booked. Accordingly, the state of the goods is selected on the mobile terminal when customer tours are put away.
