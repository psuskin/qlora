openitem: This module is used to maintain open item objects. When maintaining an open item individually, the mask structure changes depending on whether it is an open item of a customer, a supplier, an employee or a representative. In case of multiple selection of open items (e.g. from the payment proposal list), the due dates and payment blocks can be edited. OP Care Supplier: This window is used to maintain an open item of a vendor. OP Care Customer: This window is used to maintain an open item of a customer. OP nursing staff: This window is used to maintain an open position of an employee. OP Care Representative: This window is used to maintain an open item of a sales representative. Edit OPs for payments: This window is accessed from the payment proposal list and is used to automatically select the open items displayed in the payment proposal list according to the amount. This can be useful, for example, if large amounts are to be paid by check only. Edit foreign currency amount: In this window, the foreign currency amount of an open item can be subsequently edited. Module name: openitem.mod. Classes: CX_OPEN_ITEM_TXN. Security: In addition to restricting access rights via the class and its data fields, the module can be restricted in its use via some of the received messages.
