excelcel: With this module, a single cell can be read from any Excel file to be specified for test purposes. This module also offers the possibility to find the corresponding objects in ClassiX using numbers in Excel columns and to display them in a list. From this list the objects can be dragged into e.g. the favourites folder or other evaluation lists / structures. Input window: Besides the simple test of a cell content, this module offers the possibility to find and list the objects belonging to the number in ClassiX by means of numbers in an Excel table column. Example: In an Excel file, the second column of the second table contains various order numbers one below the other. These order numbers should now be searched for all together in the ClassiX system. So you open the input window and select the Excel file. Then select the class "CX_SALES_ORDER" in the group "Import complete file", enter table 2 and column 2. Now the "Read" button in the group "Read in complete file" can be pressed. All found objects are displayed in the list, from which they can be dragged and dropped into other lists (structures.) with the mouse. Module name: excelcel.mod. Classes: -.
