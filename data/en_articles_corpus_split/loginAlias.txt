loginAlias: This app allows a logged-in user to swap their login with another user's account. For this function, the user must have the system access right "Allow alias login". After a user is accepted, the machine behaves as if the selected user had logged in himself. This allows you to log in to the system as a user whose password you do not know. Possible scenarios are e.g. the re-enactment of certain errors with exactly this user (support) or the necessary access to a user account of a user who is not available. If a user is available, as a better alternative he can grant another user access to his user account by means of the substitute regulation. Input window: This window is used to register a user account by an administrator. Module name: aliasLogin.app.
