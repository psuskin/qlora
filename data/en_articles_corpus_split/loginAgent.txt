loginAgent: With this app, a logged-in user can take over the rights of another user account. In contrast to the alias login, only the rights are taken over; the logged-in user is used in change histories or for editor information. For this function, the user must have the system access right "Allow alias login".Possible scenarios are, for example, the processing of documents of users who are absent at short notice by the support or back office. If a user is available, as a better alternative he can grant another user access to his user account by means of the substitute definition. Input window: This window is used to accept a user account by an administrator. Module name: agentLogin.app.
