ZUGFeRD: ZUGFeRD is the definition of an invoice that not only contains the printable invoice in a PDF but also contains embedded XML data for machine-readable processing. The XML format always complies with the European Standard for Electronic Invoicing (EN 16931). The ZUGFeRD defined own format can, however, also contain XML data in the format of the XRECHNUNG contain.XRECHNUNG is a special XML format based on the European standard for electronic invoicing (EN 16931) used by German authorities. The basic schema is UN/CEFACT Cross Industry Invoice in XML Schemas 16B (CII). ZUGFeRD: When sending an invoice by e-mail, it can also be a PDF in the ZUGFeRD-format can be created. We use the EXTENDED format for this. If archiving is activated for the invoice, the PDF is also created there in the ZUGFeRD-format. For the export, the routing ID must be entered in the "Customer number" field in the "Additional data" folder in the customer input window. This ID is mandatory, otherwise the XRECHNUNG.XML cannot be created. To create the PDF, Ghostscript version 9.53.3 or higher must be installed and defined in the "BIN" directory in the environment variable CX_GHOSTDIR. XRECHNUNG: In the print dialogue of the invoices you can export the selected invoices in the format "XRECHNUNG.XML" via the button "File". During the export you will receive information about the file name of the created file and errors or warnings about your export. For the export it is necessary to enter the routing ID in the field "Customer number" in the folder "Additional data" in the input window of the customer. This ID is mandatory, otherwise the XRECHNUNG.XML cannot be created.
