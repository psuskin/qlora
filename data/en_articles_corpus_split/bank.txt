bank. Description: In ClassiX®, banks as partners are a special form of a company. In this special function a bank object is automatically assigned the partner function "Depot Manager" (CX_DEPOSIT_ADMINISTRATOR) when it is invested in the ClassiX® system. This partner function - not generally accessible in the standard system - manages the information on bonds, share depots and current accounts. Input window: This module is used to maintain bank data. You can select a bank by entering the bank number in the Number field and confirm with RETURN. Here you create your bank details. On the tab 'Accounts' you enter your bank account details at these banks and create the link to the cash accounts. If you want to use the automatic payment system, then you must of course enter all data completely. Fields marked with "italics" represent data directly from the company. If something is changed in one of these fields, the change is applied to all roles and the company itself. All this data can also be maintained directly in the company input window. List window: This window is used to list the banks. Selection window: This window is used to select a bank. Option window: All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed with the "OK" button. Module name: bankedt.mod. Classes: CX_BANK.
