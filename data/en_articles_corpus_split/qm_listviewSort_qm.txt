qm_listviewSort_qm: The ListView can simultaneously display objects of type CX_PERSON and CX_LEGAL_PERSON. Common to both is the data field "name", which is displayed in the first column. The second column displays various data fields, which can still be used for sorting: Either with a click on the column header, or by 1 SetSort. There are two different objects displayed in the same list. They have one field in common and one field is different. This is why SetFormat has two different formats for column 1.
