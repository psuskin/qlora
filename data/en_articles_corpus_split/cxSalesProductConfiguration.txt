cxSalesProductConfiguration: The variety of variants desired from the sales point of view leads to complexity in the article master. To master this complexity, ClassiXÂ® provides the user with various modules. One of them is the product configurator.The aim of a product configuration is to create a sales bill of materials using articles and sets. This can be done as with a modular system, in which individual components from the article master are assembled manually. However, it can also be done semi-automatically by using variant parts or sets with variant items. By querying variables (characteristics), the correct positions are automatically suggested. Another possibility is the import of a product configuration via AutoCAD or MS Excel, for example.The sales bill of material as a result of the product configuration is automatically valuated with costs and sales prices. In addition, it can be transferred to a quotation or order. Input window: This window is used to create a product configuration. List window: This window is used to list product configurations.
