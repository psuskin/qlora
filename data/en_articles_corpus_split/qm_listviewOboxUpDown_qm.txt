qm_listviewOboxUpDown_qm: The entries in the ListView can be moved with the arrow buttons. Moving is done by OboxUp or OboxDown, afterwards the underlying collection is updated via AdjustCollection. In the lower part of the window the list is displayed again. So differences between the ListView and the Collection can be recognized immediately. The window has two notebook flaps: ListView and List. On the first tab is a ListView, on the second an OList. Module name: reload_qm.mod.
