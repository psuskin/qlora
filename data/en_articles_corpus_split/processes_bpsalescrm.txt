processes_bpsalescrm: CRM (Customer Relationship Management) supports communication in the customer process with reliable figures, data and facts. The aim is to build long-term profitable customer relationships so that more sales are generated and the value of the company is increased. To ensure this, every exchange of information with the customer must be fully traceable. The CyberEnterpriseÂ® supports the CRM not only with suitable master information about customers and/or contact persons, but also with transaction processing and all other pre-formatted business documents (quotation, order, invoice, etc.). An evaluation of a customer relationship can be made via KPI monitors. Transaction processing offers the possibility to merge all communication channels of a customer. In most cases these are telephone, fax, e-mail or notes. These transaction documents are generated manually and can be stored in differently organised transaction folders. Transaction documents are assigned to different business processes and can have several defined statuses, which are controlled manually or automatically. Thus all discrete interactions with the customer can be viewed and monitored in order to optimally evaluate the information about a customer. Employees with direct customer contact are thus provided with all the relevant customer information they need, for example, when servicing or acquiring new customers. In addition to the activity documents, all pre-formatted business documents (quotation, order, invoice, etc.) are also considered as activities and are stored and posted in the activity folders of a customer or other business objects (partner, user, part, etc.). Subfolders for period, status, etc. are also automatically created. (see also transaction description).
