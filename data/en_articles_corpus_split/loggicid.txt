loggicid: This module is used to find parts request items that have reduced requirement quantities due to cancellations or secondary planning. It is possible to release (partial) quantities that have already been planned and are no longer required, or to cancel the planning (return document, goods storage, cancellation of the order, .). Functionality: This list contains all parts request items for which more goods have been planned than are still required after cancellation or creation of an auxiliary planning run. Is considered as already disposed: Further processing : Via the toolbar button old part requests can be marked as completed, i.e. they lose their "STOP" status and are thus deleted from change management. When the part request is completely posted, it is also deleted from the MRP account. All subsequent documents are retained and must be processed independently if necessary, i.e. old open orders will certainly no longer arrive, e.g. because they were not sent by the supplier, and can therefore be deleted manually. In this case the old order would have to be marked as "completed" or cancelled. The same applies to the requisition. THIS HAPPENS BY MARKING DONE NOT AUTOMATICALLY!!. Module name: loggicid.mod.
