invanaly: With this module, inventories are analysed in order to be able to draw conclusions about the quality of inventory accounting from completed inventories in the past, on the one hand, and to be able to check first of all whether the scope of the counting of inventories can be reduced by means of inventory sampling procedures, on the other. If a warehouse is suitable for inventory sampling, the samples can be drawn and checked from this module. Inventory analysis: In this window, you can compile inventory items of one or more physical inventory documents into a common list for the purpose of an analysis or for carrying out inventory sampling. The reason for merging different inventories - i.e. inventory documents - is that instead of creating just one inventory/an inventory document with all storage bins, it can also make sense to create several inventory documents subdivided according to different storage bin areas. In the latter case the inventory of another, already counted storage bin area can be entered and posted during the inventory in one storage bin area and this storage bin area can be released again. List window: This window lists the inventory samples stored in this machine. Option window: Here you can make settings for inventory sampling. The window can only be closed via the "OK" button. Once set, options can be saved as the default option for the logged in user. For this purpose, there is a context menu item on the "Preferences" tab in the "User Preferences" list which can be used to save the current options. Module name: invanaly.mod.
