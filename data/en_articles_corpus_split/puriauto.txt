You can select one or more requisition items in the list of approved requisitions and then call up this window. For each part, all suppliers from whom the parts have already been ordered are specified. Each supplier is only transferred once. You can then add or delete suppliers from the list. When you have prepared everything to your satisfaction, all you have to do is press the "OK" button. An order request will then be generated for each supplier, which contains all items.
