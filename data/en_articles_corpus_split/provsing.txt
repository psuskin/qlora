provsing: A parts-to-be-provided list consists of individual parts-to-be-provided. This module is used to record these parts to be provided, which must be provided to the supplier when ordering a part. The reference quantity is always related to 1 unit of the order part. So if 3 metres are entered as the quantity in the part to be provided, 3 metres always applies per unit of the ordered part. So if 3 parts are ordered, the quantity provided is 9 metres. It is not dependent on the standard order quantity!. Input window: This window is used to maintain parts to be provided. In addition to the part, the quantity and the characteristics, you can also set various options here as to how the item is to be exploded when creating a production parts list. The second tab "Document directory references" can also be used to link the item to document directories. A document could thus serve as an installation drawing, for example.
