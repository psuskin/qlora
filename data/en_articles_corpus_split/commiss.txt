commiss: The commission agreement is the document in ClassiXÂ® which records the client's agreement with a representative for the payment of a commission. As a rule, the commission agreement is the successor to an order, which is therefore the basis of the agreement. The amount of commission is defined in the commission agreement. The settlement is carried out via the creation of an outgoing credit note. Commission agreements can be created manually or automatically. They are created automatically if one or more representatives are assigned to a customer. When an order is created for this customer, a commission agreement is automatically created for each of these representatives. The amount of the commission is determined by the standard commission of the representative. However, the amount of the commission can also be specified individually for individual customers.
