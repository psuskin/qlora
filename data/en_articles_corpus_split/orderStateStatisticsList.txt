orderStateStatisticsList: The quotation / order header statistics module is used to evaluate, monitor (control) and plan these corresponding documents.EvaluationMonitoring (control)This module is ideal for creating order statistics, as it offers extensive search and filter options, for example. (sales area, statistics period, status, .). The column "Net value AE" is calculated from the "Value" minus "Total commissions". In the following column, this is converted into the local currency and displayed without currency so that the values can be edited more easily after transfer to Excel. The next column "adjusted" shows the amount for fully invoiced orders that results from the sum of all invoices and credit notes. This results in a possible difference between the original incoming order and the actually invoiced values. If an order has not yet been invoiced, the amount in this column corresponds to that in the previous column.The contribution margin is calculated from the adjusted net value and the cost of production and compared.The statistics are completed by the possibility of forming subtotals, for example, in order to compare the turnover of the sales areas.Monitoring is possible in particular by searching for dates, such as the delivery date of the orders and the output of the order status in the list. Functionality: The order statistics window consists of two notebook tabs. On the first one, the most common search and filter fields are displayed, as well as the list of found offers / orders. As soon as documents have been found, the group for subtotals can be displayed via the option menu. On the second tab there are further search fields, such as the search for customer, personal and other order data. All search fields, including those on the first tab, are linked AND. Using the "List output options" group, columns can be switched on or off as desired. Module name: statstvl.mod. Classes: -.
