itemAlloc: This module is used to search for specific movements of a part in the context of orders and part requests. A user is thus given the possibility to see, for example, when a part was sent to a customer. This module is intended as an aid for service/sales. Related to this are the modules Parts Usage (intended for use by technology) and Parts Consumption (intended for use by logistics). If you generally want to evaluate the use or non-use of a part in a certain period, you can do this by means of an inspection run. The selection can be limited according to document types (orders, parts requests, parts lists). The search for part usages (by ticking parts lists) can take a very long time (see also the parts usage module), the use in order items and parts requests runs via the operation folders of the part and is therefore faster. It should be noted here that the period delimitation for orders is based on the date of the order and not, for example, on the date of delivery. The parts are selected by means of the part selection window, which opens after pressing the toolbar button opens, or simply dragged into the list with the mouse. Partial rolls are also accepted here. Double-clicking opens the editing mask of the selected document. Generate recall actions: Among other things, this list is also used to create recall actions of certain parts, which have been classified as critical by the complaint statistics due to a high number of customer complaints and are to be recalled in general. The entries to be called back can be marked in the list and then deleted via the toolbar button " " a collected customer complaint can be created per customer. Option window: The following display settings can be specified in the options window:.
