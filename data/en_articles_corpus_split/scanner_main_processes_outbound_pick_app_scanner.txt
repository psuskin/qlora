scanner_main_processes_outbound_pick_app_scanner: Now we are in the dialogue loop for picking the individual parts, which is run through until either all picks have been made (automatic exit from the dialogue loop), or the pick container is full (exit by pressing "ESC").The following information is expected from the warehouse worker one after the other:Indication of the storage location where the goods are to be picked.Optional indication of the PRT if the goods in the storage bin are on a PRT.Indication of the article number or EAN code of the articleOptional specification of a pick note for this pick item (pick notes are also specified when the order item is entered).Indication of the quantityOptional indication of serial and batch numbers (whenever the item is serial or batch numbered).Validation At each of these steps, the warehouse employee's details are checked and, in the event of an error, a corresponding message is issued to the warehouse employee.Additional functions At the appropriate point within this process, additional context-specific functions are available to the warehouse employee (as shown above for the entry of the storage bin "Select row" or "Reallocation", at other points the "Print labels" etc.).Additional pick containers It is possible to use additional pick containers without first discarding the pick container currently in use. This can optimise the picking process to simplify or even avoid subsequent packing or consolidation.Interrupt picking In certain situations, the warehouse worker wants to interrupt the picking process (e.g. picking container full). He can do this by pressing "ESC". Scan bin ID: Indication of the storage bin where the goods are to be picked. Scan item ID: Specifying the item number. Enter quantity: Enter quantity. End picking (interrupt): In certain situations, the warehouse worker wants to interrupt the picking process (e.g. picking container full).
