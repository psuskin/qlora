projinfo: In addition to order/sales planning (SOFs) and short quotations (budget quotations), project information is one of the modules of the sales department. The sales department reports an upcoming project via a project info. Subsequently, a SOF can be submitted for the project info or a budget offer can be created. This is done by the field service, which is supported by the ClassiX® Juno system. Project information entered in Juno is automatically transferred to the main database of the ClassiX® ERP system. If the project information results in a business, the project information can be converted into a project (cost unit), through which the following offers or orders are processed. The aim of project information as a precursor to projects (cost objects) is therefore to separate the notification of (imminent) projects by the field service (sales) and the creation of cost objects by the office service.
