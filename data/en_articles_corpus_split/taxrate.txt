taxrate: This module is used to manage (fiscal) tax rates. You can create any number of tax rates. In addition to financial accounting, the tax rates are also used for the creation of offers, orders and invoices (order management), as well as for orders (ordering). They must therefore always be created. By specifying a tax type, the type of a tax key is specified in more detail, such as input tax or value-added tax with indication whether reduced, etc. A tax rate is also described by its use, which corresponds directly to the field "tax type" (national/EU/foreigner, etc.) in partner master data. This information makes it possible to automatically suggest the correct tax rate for quotations, orders and invoices (order management), as well as for orders (ordering). The proposed tax key also takes into account the validity of the tax key in the regions/countries. Input window: This window is used to maintain tax rates. You can select a tax rate by entering the desired key in the "Tax key" field and confirming it with RETURN or by double-clicking on a tax rate in the list window to call it up for editing. For the tax rates, enter the link to the corresponding tax accounts and also enter the link to the tax office in order to be able to generate the tax returns automatically. List window: Used to list the tax rates. Selection window: This window is used to select a tax rate. Module name: taxrate.mod. Classes: CX_TAX.
