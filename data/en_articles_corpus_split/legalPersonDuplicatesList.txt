legalPersonDuplicatesList: When duplicate matching, the name is split up according to the spaces and line breaks and searched for these in the company master data using wildcards. For companies found in this way, the name is not checked, only the country, town and street. If the street in the found company does not contain the term "P.O. Box" in the checked company or vice versa, the company is considered to be the same so that a manual check can be carried out. In addition, the sales tax identification number is also checked. The check is carried out in the input mask before saving if the automatic check at save is set in the options. Examples of duplicates: Why is this a duplicate?
