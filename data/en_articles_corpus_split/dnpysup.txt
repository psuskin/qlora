dnpysup: If a contract for work and services in the capital goods or plant construction sector is concluded with a supplier, the latter may demand a down payment as a guarantee for the fulfilment of the contract or as short or medium-term financing. This loan granted to the creditor without interest is agreed upon in the order via the instalment payment conditions. The down payment request document is not an accounting document but only a memorandum item which reminds you of a down payment to be made. Therefore, the down payment requests in the open items of the supplier represent a separate heading which does not change the balance. As the down payment represents a provisional payment for the entire work performance, it is to be offset against the final invoice. Functionality: On the one hand, down payments can be entered manually via the empty processing mask. For this purpose, the order for which the payment is to be requested must be selected and the corresponding data set. On the other hand, the down payment request can also be entered directly from the payment plan of the order. This method has the advantage that all relevant data is set automatically. Input window: This window is for maintaining vendor down payment requests. List window: This window is used to list the down payment requests Supplier.
