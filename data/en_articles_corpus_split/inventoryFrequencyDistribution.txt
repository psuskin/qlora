inventoryFrequencyDistribution: With this app, previously selected inventory items can be divided into freely selectable value ranges. This provides an overview of the value distribution of inventory items, which is particularly useful for stratified inventory sampling. The BIRT reports "Frequency distribution" and "Lorenz curve" are available as standard reports. Frequency and value distribution: With regard to a stratified inventory sampling, the upper limit of the 1st stratum (and thus the determination of the variance for further stratification), as well as the upper limit of the last stratum (and thus the determination of the many, low-value inventory items, which account for approx. 50% - 55% of the inventory value and therefore should only be taken by sample) can be determined here. Module name: inventoryFrequencyDistribution.app. Classes: CX_INVENTORY. Security: In addition to restricting access rights via the class and its data fields, the module can be restricted in its use via some of the received messages.
