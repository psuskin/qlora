Pythia_xmlimprt_py: With this module, anti-terrorism or other sanctions lists can be imported into the Pythia database or updated. The standard version includes the comparison with the sanctions lists of the European Union EU and the United Nations UN. In addition to the import/update of the sanctions lists, a comparison is automatically made with the persons/companies/one-time addresses that are listed in a whitelist or blacklist. If the information of a person/company from a sanctions list changes, which is assigned to a person/company/one-time address from these lists, then this assigned person/company/one-time address from either the whitelist or the blacklist is transferred to the checklist for renewed verification. After an import of a sanctions list a mass comparison with the person/company/one-time address of the host database and the contacts from Outlook should take place immediately afterwards. Selection window: This window is used to select the sanctions lists to be imported or compared. The sanctions lists provide data on persons and companies blocked by the EU or UN. Personal data: In addition to attributes such as date of birth (only the first named is taken over), gender, title, function or language, the data on the name of a blocked function are the decisive ones for carrying out a comparison. Attributes such as passport number or nationality are not processed. Company data: For companies, a comparison can only be made via the name:. Module name: xmlimprt.mod.
