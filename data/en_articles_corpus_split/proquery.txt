proquery: Through project research, ClassiXÂ® offers its users the possibility to get an overview of completed projects. The scope of functions ranges from general project data to the parts and serial numbers installed in the plant. Functionality: In order to explain the functionality of the project research we use a scenario: "Operator A wants to know whether part X has been installed in his plant." If you do not start the search at the beginning of the entry points (with the attachment), the fields from the entry point to the left are filled automatically. For example, if you select an order, the project and the attachment are displayed directly in the respective fields. Expanded list: In this window, the list whose "Expand" button was used to open the window is displayed in more detail by displaying additional information. The selection made here is passed on directly to the initial list of the search mask. Option window: All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed via the "OK" button.
