queryatt: You can search objects by their attributes (e.g. all parts that are black). Functionality: Almost all data in the ClassiXÂ® system can receive additional information via so-called attributes. For example, an attribute could be assigned to each company, indicating how many employees this company employs. Another one, how many screen workstations there are. This module is now available, for example, to search for all companies with more than 40 workstations. It allows a combination of an unlimited number of attributes, which searches for suitable objects in the list from which this search was opened. All attributes to be searched for can be inserted into the list with the "Insert" button. After the insertion the comparison operators (e.g. =, >, present, not present) and the possibly required comparison values can be set here. They are linked with"AND". So if two attributes are inserted in this list, both attributes (as set) must be present on the object in order to obtain a hit in the search. Example: Search via the list of companies: Attribute "NUMBER_OF_EMPLOYEES", comparison operator ">=" comparison value "40". All companies that have the attribute NUMBER_COMPLETEES with a value greater than or equal to 40 are found. Module name: queryatt.mod. Classes: CX_ITEM.
