costiobj: Cost objects are part of cost accounting alongside cost types and cost centres. However, the term cost object is also used synonymously with the term opportunity (marketing/sales), the term project (order processing) and the term framework contract (purchasing), depending on the field of expertise. A cost object thus describes a business object to which various existing objects and various documents can be assigned. Internal cost units are e.g. own development orders or trade fair appearances. The costs posted via financial accounting can also be posted to cost centres in parallel (similar to "statistical internal orders" in an SAP system). The documents assigned to an internal cost object, i.e. the documents posted with an internal cost object can also contain costs/services. Thus, costs/services can be assigned to an internal cost object either directly via financial accounting or via special (cost) documents (e.g. time sheets).
