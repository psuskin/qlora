projcost: This module is used to list the costs of a project summarised by item groups. For each article group the target 0 costs (costs from the project planning), the target 1 costs (costs from recorded offers), the target 2 costs (costs from recorded orders) and the actual costs incurred are displayed. This evaluation thus aims in particular to show the development of costs - separately for each item group. List window: In the upper area of the window, the documents of the cost object/project are listed. After calling up the statistics, the lower area of the window displays the costs according to target 0, target 1, planned/actual and actual for each individual item group. Module name: projcost.mod.
