auditing: This app is used for an application-related auditing of programme processes. Once activated, the trace instructions stored in the program code are sent from this machine to this app as an indication of the program sequences being processed. During program execution, it is thus possible to observe at which points in the program code the system is currently located - which program parts are currently being run through - and which objects are changed in the process. One could also speak of "semantic debugging" here. In addition, this app is used to implement access control. Functionality: Display of the programme code passages passed through (upper list box) and the objects changed in the process (lower list box). A double-click on the objects in the lower list box opens the corresponding input window (if available). A right mouse click sends the selected object to the object inspector.
