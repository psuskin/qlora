The following comparisons would be conceivable:Comparisons with other systems (benchmarking) Comparisons with older values on the same system Daily performance curves You can also use this app to change database parameters (e.g. those of the fetch policy (see below)) or to get the key figures of the database in the tab "Statistics". To do so, open this app, set the appropriate value and start any other app. After the called functionality is finished you can examine the results in this app. Performance measurement window: Various tests can be accessed via the Performance Measurement window.
