fwdfabal: The balances of G/L and personal accounts (debtors, creditors, employees and commission recipients) can be automatically carried forward from one fiscal year to the following fiscal year. The call can be made either for all accounts or for individual number ranges. For individual accounts it is also possible to enter the balance carried forward manually via the activity 'Post' and select the business transaction 'Opening entry'. Functionality: After selecting the closing, opening period and accounts, the balance of the closing period is automatically taken over as the opening balance of the opening period. At the end of the transfer, the generated posting document can be viewed directly. The balance carried forward can be executed repeatedly, only the open balances are then carried forward. The balance already carried forward into the opened fiscal year is compared with the balance of the closing fiscal year - regardless of the selected opening period in the opening fiscal year. Reconciliation accounts are generally not transferred directly; if they are called up here, there is no balance carried forward posting: reconciliation accounts are only carried forward via the subledger accounts assigned to the reconciliation accounts. The only exception to this is if a reconciliation account has been defined as a down payment account and no subledger accounts have been assigned: in this case it is treated as a normal G/L account and thus carried forward.
