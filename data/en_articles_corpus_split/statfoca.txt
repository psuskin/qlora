statfoca: Using the incoming order statistics, the expected value of incoming orders can be calculated for a specific period. The statistics are created on the basis of the order/sales planning documents. The evaluation can be run over one or more statistical periods in a target/actual comparison. In the evaluation of a single period, the target sales volume is only derived from the documents that were posted to this statistical period. In a from-to period evaluation, only the last documents within the selected period are taken into account for linked (copied) documents. The statistics can be displayed with subtotals made per month or per year. List window: This window is used for listing . Option window: All settings for the search can be made here.
