qm_queryExist_qm: This module tests queries with the ? operator. Queries can be entered in the edit field and executed with Enter. The result is then displayed at the bottom of the list. In addition, an auto test is also possible, which can be started with the corresponding button. But before that you should try 'Mr. Proper' so that the Auto-Test finds a clean database. Test module generates 2 persons (alpha, beta) and checks if the ? operator works correctly by making some queries and checking the number of returned objects with the target. The autotest assumes that there are no CX_PERSONS stored in the database. Module name: reload_qm.mod.
