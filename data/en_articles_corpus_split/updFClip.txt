updFClip: A list previously exported via the clipboard - and then possibly revised in Excel and copied from there to the clipboard again - can be re-imported with this module, i.e. the values from the clipboard overwrite the values in the list. The assignment of a line of the list and a line from the clipboard is done by specifying one or more columns, which together uniquely identify a line. Input window: This window is used to specify the key columns (to identify the rows) and the assignments of the columns to each other. Module name: updFClip.mod. Classes: -.
