bankcode: ClassiXÂ® manages a register of bank codes or bank identification numbers to protect you from incorrect entries. If you confirm a bank code with RETURN somewhere in the program, the system searches for a corresponding entry in the bank code/ sort code list. If there are several entries for the entered bank code, you can select the correct bank from a list. It is very common that you will find several entries under one bank code, this also applies to the SWIFT code. These codes are not unique. Internally, however, the individual entries are distinguished by a - unique - consecutive number of the data record. This register can be loaded from files provided by central banks (see below). You can also do this several times to update your register. When you update, the record is checked based on its serial number. Since only this sequence number of the data set allows a unique allocation, it is not possible for the user to change this field. Input window: This window is used to maintain bank code/BLZ. You can select a bank code by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search".
