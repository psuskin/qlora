olapSupplierList: With this module a supplier/article or article/supplier statistic can be created for certain periods of time. The basis of these statistics are 2-dimensional OLAP data cubes (see also monitors) between suppliers and article objects. Depending on the selection of the - primary - dimension (i.e. the point of entry) into the statistics, the second remaining dimension is the so-called secondary dimension. If you choose "suppliers" as the primary dimension, the "articles" are the secondary sub-dimension and vice versa.Depending on the selection of the primary dimension (suppliers or articles), the total values of the statistics can vary. This is due to the fact that with "suppliers" sales can also be made without articles (e.g. when using text articles or fixed values in incoming invoices). A statistic according to "Suppliers" can therefore be larger in total than the "same" statistic according to "Articles".The data is updated each time an order, an incoming invoice or a credit note is saved. Whether the values are shown in the totals of the statistics depends on the status of the respective documents. Below is a list of the statuses that are included in the statistics totals for the various documents (the documents themselves are nevertheless always kept in the corresponding data cubes, only the values are not always added up):Order Statistics are not recorded for the following statuses :"Only created""On demand""Call-off order completed""Canceled""Susts"Invoices and credit notes are written to the statistics after releaseAll statistic values are held in local currency only. List window: This window displays the supplier/article statistics after selecting the criteria. Module name: cshowsup.mod. Classes: -.
