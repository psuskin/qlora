General capacity planning: Planning the capacity for a resource is always done in 3 steps (please refer to the links to the different sections for more details on each topic): Step 1: Set the available capacity of the resource Step 2: Planning of requirements Step 3: Overview of the planned capacity:. Capacity planning in parts requirements: ClassiXÂ® offers two options for scheduling: Capacity check CTP Usual procedure with desired detailed planning: In brief, the process is as follows: Usual procedure with sufficient rough planning Capacity test CTP Functionality The capacity is defined on the basis of given available hours within a calendar week of a work centre or resource. Each routing item that requires this work center and/or resource adds its expected capacity requirements to the workload of the work center/resource. If the booked requirement plus the requirement to be checked is greater than the planned capacity, there is a bottleneck and the capacity check returns a message about insufficient capacity. Work sequences can extend over several calendar weeks. A work sequence can be spread over several calendar weeks if it has a throughput time of 2 days and starts on a Friday. The total target time is then divided by the number of days and then multiplied by the number of days required in the current calendar week. This results in the proportionally required capacity, in this example the first week has exactly 50% of the target time, the second week also 50%. Via the editing mask of the exploded work plans, the exact booking can be displayed via context menu (Show bookings) - a new window opens with the list of booked resources with proportional capacity in the respective calendar week and a coloured box indicating whether sufficient capacity is available.
