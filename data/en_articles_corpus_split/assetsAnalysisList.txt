assetsAnalysisList: A statement of changes in fixed assets shows the development of fixed assets from the original historical acquisition and production costs through the additions, disposals, transfers and write-ups of the past financial year, the accumulated depreciation, as well as the book value on the balance sheet date. The fixed-asset movement schedule therefore does not show the development during the financial year to be closed, i.e. from the residual book value at the end of the previous year to the residual book value at the end of the financial year (see the fixed-asset movement schedule), but from the original acquisition or production costs to the residual book value on the respective balance sheet date. A reconciliation of the columns of a statement of changes in fixed assets can therefore be made as follows: Original acquisition or production costs plus additions of a business year minus disposals of a financial year +/- transfers of a business year minus accumulated depreciation plus write-ups of a financial year = book value at the end of the financial year Normally, an asset history sheet is presented sorted by asset classes, which primarily follow the structure of a balance sheet. Since assets are also assigned to asset groups (classification according to properties) and cost centres, the asset history sheet can also be output according to these structured classification terms. List window: Used to list the attachment mirror objects. After selecting a structure and the business year, click on the totals button. The total sums of the fixed assets are then displayed in the "Fixed asset classes" line. The list can now be broken down to each individual fixed asset. Module name: asssched.mod.
