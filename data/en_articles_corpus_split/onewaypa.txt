onewaypa: One-time addresses are used in ClassiXÂ® in order not to inflate the master data if an address is used once and has no informative value for the company afterwards. For example, an order can be delivered to a ship that is temporarily in a port. The address of the port has no value for the company after delivery, so it is not worthwhile to create it as a company. One-time addresses can be created as one-time persons or one-time companies. This module is used to search and list the one-time partners. List window: This window is used to list one-time partners.
