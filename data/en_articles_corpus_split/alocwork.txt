alocwork: Indicates the use of a workstation. The term "work center" is used as a synonym for the resources work center, workgroup, and machine. Filtering The user can choose whether he wants to see a usage in production orders and/or in master data (master routings or resource in work centres). List window: When the display window is called up for the first time, the filter "Master data" is set by default. A double click on an entry in the list shows the occurrence(s) of the workstation in work plan positions (detail window): if a workstation is used from several master work plan positions, a list of these work plan positions is displayed. A double-click on one of these entries navigates directly to this master plan position. The context menu for navigating can be called up from a list entry using the right mouse button: here too, you can reach the occurrence of the place in routings (analogous to double-clicking, see above) or the corresponding user of the routing, i.e. the production role of a part. If you click on a usage from an order, the order-specific production parts list opens. Module name: alocwork.mod. Classes: CX_ALLOCATION.
