attrslot: A preset attribute wraps a dynamic data field with a value specification. This value is offered each time the preset attribute is used, but can then be overwritten individually. The type of presetting depends on the (data) type of the wrapped dynamic data field. For example, if the type is a STRING (character string), you can specify a text or leave the field empty. For example, if the type is CX_VALUE, you can specify the number of decimal places and the unit for the value. For enumeration types (enumerations: ENUMCHAR or ENUMSHORT) the value tables stored in the system (with binding to the dynamic data field) are offered for presetting. However, these tables can also be individually overwritten by the preset characteristics. The property of preset characteristics to manage their own tables also applies to other data types. For example, for a dynamic data field of type CX_VALUE, you can specify a table with values for the "width", such as "100 mm", "200mm" and "300mm". These values are then offered each time the preset attribute is used. If you want to allow only these values to be entered, you can do so by clicking on the "Exclusive" button. You can find more information in the topic Features. Attention: Attribute values are only supported in the formulas up to a maximum of 100 characters!.
