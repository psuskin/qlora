statwrap: The progress of a document in a process is described by its status. However, since this assignment to a status is often not sufficient to obtain more detailed information about the process, the status can be described in more detail by this module. For example, the "not delivered" status of an order could be given the information why the status cannot/ has not yet been moved on. Input window: The input window consists of two notebook flaps. In the tab "Status information" the status can be described, firstly by the short text and secondly by the comment. The short text has the function of a heading. A description of the status should be given here by simple/short entries. The selection of predefined texts from a predefined table, which is set according to the business process, serves as an aid. The processor can also enter a free text. In the comment field, the user can provide further, explanatory information. The agent and date are set automatically the first time the status is edited. Afterwards, the information can also be maintained by clicking the button for the agent and the date or fields. Module name: statwrap.mod. Classes: -.
