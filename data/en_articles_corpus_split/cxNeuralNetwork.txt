cxNeuralNetwork: This app is used to set the parameters of a neural network. Some parameters can/must be set directly when creating a new neural network, others can be adjusted during training. Therefore, the editing window is divided into a "Setup Parameters" window and a "Training Parameters" window.However, the first fixed setting is always a distinction between a "Regression" or a "Classifying" neural network, so this setting must be made first. Once created, this specification and the "Setup Parameters" can no longer be changed. Network: In this window all parameters of a neural network can be defined and maintained. Module name: neuralNetworkInitialize.app. Classes: CX_NEURAL_NETWORK. Security: In addition to restricting access rights via the class and its data fields, the module can be restricted in its use via some of the received messages.
