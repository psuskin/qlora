orderqui: The quote/order fast entry is a user interface which allows single-stage, unstructured quotes/orders to be entered efficiently, whereas the normal quote/order mask is more suitable for entering complex, structured quotes or orders (e.g. for larger, complex machines or plants).Due to a TAPI connection, this module is also ideal for entering quotations/orders via telephone sales. Callers are automatically recognised and can be directly transferred to a new offer or a new order.The quote/quick order entry mask is completed by displaying the own processes, the processes of the caller and the predecessors of the customer from the currently opened order. Functionality: This window is used for quick entry of unstructured quotations/orders. Determination of availability: The user is already informed about the availability of the sold goods during the entry of order items. The following rules control whether and at what time the goods are shown as available after the article selection. If the order item was entered completely or an already existing order was called up, the quantity available on the delivery date and, if necessary, the error stock is displayed in the item list. Maintain further attributes: For space reasons only the first 4 (most important) attributes of an article are displayed when editing an item. If there are additional attributes, they can be maintained in this window. Module name: orderqui.mod. Classes: CX_SALES_ORDER.
