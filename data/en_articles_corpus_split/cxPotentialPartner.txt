cxPotentialPartner. Description: In the early phase of a sales acquisition process, company contacts are assigned to interested party roles (even multiple roles). In the interested party role, information such as "Interested in", the status and the grouping of the interest of a company contact are stored. BANT criteria (B-udget, A-uthority, N-eed, T-ime) can be entered as characteristics. Each of these interested party roles thus defines a "lead". If the interest of a company contact grows, the next step in the sales acquisition process is to assign a sales opportunity (marketing cost unit) to the interested party (lead). Input window: This module is used to maintain the data of interested parties. You can select an interested party by entering the interested party number in the Number field and confirm with RETURN. Fields marked with "italics" represent data directly from the company. If something is changed in one of these fields, the change is applied to all roles and the company itself. All this data can also be maintained directly in the company input window. Data Acquisition Wizard: With this wizard, settings can be set for a group of selected prospects in one. The data fields can be hidden or shown by means of the checkboxes in front of the groups "Processor", "Group", "Status", "Interested in" and "Order term". Data fields that are shown are changed in the interested parties by the wizard. . These groups are not changed by hiding them. List window: This window serves to list the interested parties. Selection window: This window is used to select interested parties. Option window: All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed by clicking the "OK" button.
