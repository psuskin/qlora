costpobj: Along with cost types and cost centres, cost objects are part of cost accounting. However, the term cost object is also used synonymously with the term sales opportunity (marketing/sales), the term project (order processing) and the term internal cost object (e.g. R&D), depending on the specialist area. A cost object thus describes a business object to which a wide variety of inventory objects and a wide variety of documents can be assigned. The documents assigned to a cost object, i.e. the documents posted with a cost object can also contain costs/services. Thus, costs/services can be assigned to a cost object either directly via financial accounting or via special (cost) documents (e.g. time sheets). A company can receive different types of incoming invoices. The majority of incoming invoices are based on a purchase order, through which the invoice is entered in ClassiX. Thus, the invoice can be entered semi-automatically with regard to the data and an automatic invoice verification can be carried out against the order. A second type of incoming invoice are "free invoices", which are usually entered manually in the system without direct trigger/predecessor and therefore always have to be checked manually. By creating purchasing cost units, invoices for a maintenance, leasing or rental contract, for example, can also be entered and checked semi-automatically even though they are not preceded by a purchase order. Especially with monthly maintenance invoices, a manual run means regular, unnecessary additional work. The purchasing cost unit represents the contract concluded between the company and the customer.
