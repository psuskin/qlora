paydtaus: With this module, the open items selected from a payment proposal list are released for payment by creating a financial accounting payment document and (optionally) immediately afterwards the bank data medium is created in the German data exchange format DTAUS for domestic payments. The creation of the bank data medium in the German data exchange format DTAUS can also be called up/repeated separately for a payment run (payment document of the financial accounting). This format becomes invalid from 1.2.2014. Posting/creating payments Bank data medium in DTAUS format: From this window, the open items selected in the payment proposal list are released for payment by bank data medium. Create bank data medium in DTAUS format: From this window, a bank data medium in DTAUS format can be created for a payment document in financial accounting. To do this, enter the document number of the payment run (to be repeated) and the corresponding period. In the repeat run, you have the option of subsequently excluding payments by selection. Since the payments are already posted at this point, this should only be done in exceptional cases. You therefore require special access rights to this function and must then remember to maintain the excluded payments for accounting purposes. In the DTAUS file format, a maximum of 15 individual details of 27 characters each can be output per individual payment to indicate the purpose of the payment (= open item). If the own number is stored with the supplier, it is output in the first proof of use with "KD nnnn", then all paid documents are output with "NR nnnnn xxxxxxx,xxEUR" (nnn = invoice or credit note number, xxx,xx the paid amount (discount is deducted)). If more than 15 open items are paid per payee, these are divided into correspondingly cleared â‚¬1.00 payments. Module name: paydtaus.mod. Classes: -.
