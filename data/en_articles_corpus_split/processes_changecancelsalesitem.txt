processes_changecancelsalesitem. The quantity of the sales order item is to be cancelled.: For this purpose it is necessary to differentiate the procurement type of the part, as different conditions arise:. Purchase section: If no requirement request, purchase order has been created or goods receipt has been provided yet, cancellation is possible at any time via the order item menu "Edit -> Further processing -> Cancel order item". Stock section: Order items with the status warehouse reservation can be cancelled at any time before provision. After provision by a goods withdrawal, either the goods withdrawal must be deleted (statistics period is not yet completed) or a goods storage must be created to relieve the order. By creating the goods putaway, the provided goods are taken back from the order item and the item is again in the status warehouse reservation. Now it can be cancelled.
