holdinre: ClassiXÂ® offers the possibility to automatically consume excess quantities of disposable parts, i.e. the stock of these parts, before the remaining quantity is procured according to the type of provision - i.e. disposable. For this purpose, the warehouse reserve document is necessary because, in contrast to normal warehouse parts, the available quantity must be reserved directly for requirements (order or parts request item). A warehouse reserve document is automatically generated via the parts request (see: surplus quantities) or the technical release of order items (see: surplus quantities). Input window: This window is used to maintain inventory reserve documents. List window: This window is used to list the inventory holdback documents. Selection window: This window is used to select a warehouse reserve document. Module name: cxHoldInReserve.mod. Classes: CX_HOLD_IN_RESERVE.
