qs-purchaseinvoice. Release check: Since an incoming invoice should not be released if the goods to be inspected have not yet passed through quality assurance, the QS quantities are taken into account in the release process. Test suites are required in this area, as the QS flag can be set not only on the part but also on various documents. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the entire order/invoice quantity passes through QS. % No data is written away during the tests. Instead, the test is aborted with a comment if an error has occurred.
