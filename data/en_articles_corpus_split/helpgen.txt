helpgen: Program for generating a ClassiX® help in HTML format. The help is compiled from the information provided by ClassiX® (SystemObject Call(ParseLib), SystemObject Call(GetModules), modul Call(LoadExternalModule), module Call(GetWindows), TRUE/FALSE modul Call(ReportMessages)). Functionality: You will need the program gem.exe in the subdirectory of the CX_ROOTDIR "\Bin\") to generate a bitmap which will be integrated into the help as an overview of the modules of the technical documentation. Unfortunately, the bitmap can currently only reflect the standard module structure. Enter the desired data and then press the "Help gen." button. An Html file and a bitmap will be generated in the directory C:\, which are identified by the name of the base module with the respective extension (.htm .bmp). If you use FrontPage, you can import the generated help into the FrontPage web of the AppsWh help using the import function of the tool (see also "Import (command)" in the FrontPage documentation). Module name: helpgen.cxp. Classes: -. Security: In addition to restricting access rights via the class and its data fields, the module can be restricted in its use via some of the received messages. Received messages: none.
