units: In the ClassiX® system, all SI units and the most common currencies are defined by default. In addition to these standard units, further user-defined units can be added to the system with this module. These can be derived units based on the already defined units, e.g. "km" based on "m", "MJ" (Mega-Joule) based on "J" (Joule) or "T€" based on "€". Or you can define new basic units, like "pallet", "bottle", etc. For the latter, part-specific unit tables are then stored on the parts themselves. The units stored in the system can - as soon as they are based on the same units - be converted directly. If this is not the case, conversion tables must be defined. The ClassiX system provides the above mentioned part-specific unit tables and tables for currency conversion as conversion tables. All units defined in the system are stored as prime numbers, which ensures precise and fast conversion. Only a limited number of user-defined basic units, about 500, including units that have been deleted, can be generated at all. If you want to create units for testing purposes, please do this in a test system. The limitation of the total number of user-defined units is 9700.
