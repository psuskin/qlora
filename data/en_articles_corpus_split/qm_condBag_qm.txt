qm_condBag_qm: This module checks all functions for conditional object tables. In the upper area you can see the current table with the conditions. Here you can add and remove as many conditions as you like. Adding is done by entering appropriate values in the fields and pressing the button. The first field is the operator for an integer, the second field contains the number for comparison. The third field contains the operator for a string comparison, the fourth field contains the comparison string. The two conditions are automatically linked with 'and'. The fifth field contains a CX_VALUE as result, which is returned if the whole condition is fulfilled. The middle area shows the objects that are currently in the plugspace. Here you can add and remove any objects. Only the data fields 'int' and 'str' have to be set, because they are used for comparison with the conditions. In the lower area, various methods of the class can now be checked by simply pressing the corresponding buttons. The respective result is displayed in the list between the buttons, or can also result in an error message. The checkboxes below can be used to control which flags should be set. The exact effect of these can be found in the documentation for CX_CONDITIONED_BAG. The 'BindMessage' check box controls whether a message is defined for error handling or not.
