jobscond: A conditional work sequence of a work plan contains a conditional list of individual work sequences, the so-called variants. This provides a set of instruments to define different resources in a work sequence, e.g. due to different characteristics of the part to be produced. Different time specifications can also be stored as a table in an individual work sequence. In the course of a routing explosion, the item whose condition is fulfilled first is inserted into the production routing. Input window: This window is used to maintain conditional work plan sequences. Work sequence variant: This window is used to maintain a sequence of operations variant. The structure of the editing window may vary slightly depending on whether you are editing a work plan or a resource plan. Module name: alloccon.mod. Classes: CX_CONDITIONED_ALLOCATION.
