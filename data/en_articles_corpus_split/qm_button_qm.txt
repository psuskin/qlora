qm_button_qm: This test checks the display of the different button types. The first thing that appears is a normal button. Below this is a non-selectable button and one that reveals a tooltip. The next two buttons demonstrate the use of images. The first one contains only one image and the second one changes its appearance by swapping two images with one click. Module name: reload_qm.mod.
