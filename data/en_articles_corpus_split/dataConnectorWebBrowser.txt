dataConnectorWebBrowser: The CyberEnterprise Browser graphically displays data connectors and their connections to each other. Here it is possible to virtually walk through the entire CyberEnterprise. The CyberEnterprise is displayed as a graph. The nodes in this graph are the data connectors and the edges corresponding to the data fields. Only data fields are displayed which really refer to a data connector. If a connection between two data connectors is a relation with back reference, an arrowhead is shown on both sides, otherwise only along the reference. If a data field corresponds to a collection type, this is indicated by a small symbol at the beginning of the arrow. Module name: "module".mod. Classes: CX_"Class.
