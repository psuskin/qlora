PurchaseApproval. Define approver: The approvers are determined in the approval business process. Define purchasing areas: Purchasing areas are defined in the form of a general structure (e.g. Main Menu -> Organisation -> Structures) with the structure ID "PURCHASING_GROUPS". Nodes of the structure represent the individual purchasing areas; a responsible employee is assigned to a node (via drag&drop in the structure) as well as corresponding order items ( also via drag&drop or in the order item mask, field "Purchasing area"). Entering requisitions: The purchasing department is prompted by the requisitions to trigger orders. Every employee in the company can create requirement coverage requests. A distinction is made between three types: Own use must be approved by a superior. Customer and warehouse requirements are automatically approved if the "Approval" checkbox is not selected. Approvers are listed in the "Approval" field on the requirement request header. In order to have a requisition approved by a superior or to forward it directly to the purchasing department, it must be posted. The posting cannot take place automatically, as otherwise the approver/purchaser would receive the requirement coverage request before it has been checked by the processor. Edit requirement coverage requests to be approved: Requisitions to be approved are distributed to the respective approval folders (see above Define approvers). An approver opens the list "Documents to be approved" by double-clicking on the folder and can view, approve or reject the requisitions there.
