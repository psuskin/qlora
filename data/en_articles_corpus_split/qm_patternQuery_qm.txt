qm_patternQuery_qm: With this module queries with pattern matching (i.e. queries with '~') can be checked. For other queries see also Queries and Index Management or Queries with ? operator The button 'Autotest' creates 3 persons in the database and then tries to find them. The prerequisite for this is a database in which no CX_PERSON objects are present in order to compare the number of objects found with the expected result. For this purpose the button "Delete persons objects" must be pressed first. A freely selectable query can also be entered in the 'Query string' text field at the top right and executed with the 'Start' button. In the queries up to three variables can be used over %s, which are then replaced with the content from the parameter fields (from right to left). The result of this manual query is displayed in the list box. Module name: reload_qm.mod.
