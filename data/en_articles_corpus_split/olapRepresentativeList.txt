olapRepresentativeList: With this module a commission taker (representative)/sales item or sales item/commission taker(representative) statistics can be created for specific periods of time. The basis of these statistics are 2-dimensional OLAP data cubes (see also monitors) between representatives and sales item objects. Depending on the selection of the - primary - dimension (i.e. the point of entry) into the statistics, the second remaining dimension is the so-called secondary dimension. If you choose"representatives" as the primary dimension, the "sales items" are the secondary sub-dimension and vice versa.Depending on the selection of the primary dimension (commission recipient (representative) or sales item), the total values of the statistics can vary. This is because sales can be made with "representatives" even without sales articles (e.g. when using text articles or fixed values in orders or outgoing credit notes). A statistic according to "commission recipients" can therefore be larger in total than the "same" statistic according to "sales articles".The data is updated each time an invoice or credit note is saved. Whether the values are shown in the totals of the statistics depends on the status of the respective documents. Below is a list of the statuses that are included in the statistics totals for the various documents (the documents themselves are nevertheless always kept in the corresponding data cubes, only the values are not always added up):Invoices/credit notesAll registered invoices/credit notes are included in the statistics (registered credit notes are only considered if they are issued for a customer. Credit memos for commission recipients are therefore excluded, for example)All statistic values are held in local currency only. List window: After selecting the criteria, this window displays the commission recipient/item of sale statistics. Module name: cshowcus.mod. Classes: -.
