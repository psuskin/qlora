associatl: For each document, it is possible to create it with documents from the document master, local documents and, in the case of quotations/orders (+items), transactions. This is controlled via the Insert button and the menu that appears. When inserting, you can choose between local document references and global document references. Associations can also be other objects, such as transaction data, master data or calculations. These are inserted into the list by Drag&Drop. Associations can be stored for all document types via the document history. Associations (evidence): This window is used for general maintenance of associations. For example, it can be accessed via the document history for each document to associate it with document references or activities. Associations (part and part roles): There are separate processing windows for processing the parts and their roles (parts, sales item, order item mask, etc.) In this way, for example, the purchasing view of a part can be edited by the purchasing department and, among other things, can be blocked for other employees by the specific editing mask. The editing of the document can, however, be cross-departmental, if, for example, the design department maintains the documents that are to be sent to the supplier in the ordering process. The documents of the part and its roles can be managed centrally via this window. Module name: associat.mod. Classes: -.
