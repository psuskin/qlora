listvcol: Many of the lists/evaluations in the AppsWarehouse® of ClassiX® can be accessed via the symbols is called up from a buffer memory, deleted and can be saved. This functionality allows on the one hand to temporarily store a list once called up and to call it up again at another time. On the other hand, a user can allow another user - who does not have this access right - to view a list for which this user has an access right. A saved list transferred in this way can be restricted in its use (see the documentation of the respective evaluation). A list is saved for each user, but a user can save multiple versions of the same list. List window: This window displays all the lists saved by the logged-in user. These are displayed with category, list name, list identification (e.g. user abbreviation), creation date and number of list entries. The category can be used to allow a user to save several different contents of the same list. With the right mouse button you can transfer a selected list to another user. This user can view the list even if he or she does not have the permission to create the list. In addition, the text of the saved list can be edited with the right mouse button. Selection window: This window is used to select the saved lists. Only the list contents of all users saved for the current list are displayed. Selection Version: This window is used to select a version of a list saved multiple times. This window opens if you want to save a list that has already been saved more than once - a list that may have been saved at different times or called up with different parameters and then saved each time.
