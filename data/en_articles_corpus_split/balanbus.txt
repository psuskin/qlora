balanbus: This module displays the annual and period balances of offers, orders, invoices and credit notes booked in the business areas. In addition, periodised planning figures can be stored for each area. In the case of business unit nodes, the subordinate business units are also displayed!. Period balance window: After calling up this window, the period balances of the actual and planned figures of the current fiscal year are listed. The displayed fiscal year can be converted to all fiscal years stored in the system. By pressing the button the period balances can also be displayed graphically in a bar chart. Planning figures window: This window is used to maintain the plan figures. If no plan figures have been entered yet, all fields in the window are empty. In this case no fiscal year is selected by default. In the upper part of the window, the planned figures for the entire fiscal year are displayed, and directly below, within the group Breakdown by Periods, the planned figures for the individual periods for the selected business area are displayed in a list. After first selecting the desired fiscal year for entering the plan figures, the "Save" button appears: this saves the annual plan figures from the "Plan figures" field for the entire fiscal year and distributes them evenly to all periods. The period plan figures can be maintained manually by double-clicking in the list, which changes the annual plan figure as a sum of all period values. Module name: balancos.mod.
