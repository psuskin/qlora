icastedt: This module serves to create and delete parts or service-role relationships. Several roles can be assigned to each part or service, for example, a part can have the role sales article and product. Roles are used to enable the use of the business object. Input window: The window "Part/Service <-> Roles" consists of two notebook windows. In the first sub-window you can have the different roles listed for one part and in the other the corresponding part or service for the role is shown. If you open the window via the roll, the other window is automatically completed. The same happens when opening via the part, only that the "Role -> Part" window is only filled if the part has only one role. If this is not the case, it is hidden. By selecting a role, you can then access the "Role -> Part" window via the icon with the "theatre mask". Assign new roles: If a part has already been created, for example as a product, and now becomes an order part, you can simply add a new role to the existing entry. Select the entry in the parts list and click on the role icon. Next click on 'Create', select the additional role of the part and add it to the existing entry with 'Select'. The input mask for the order data opens automatically (in this example). You can now add or change the specific data in this mask. If the order part number is not automatically assigned by the counter, you should assign and enter it. Then close the mask with 'OK' to save your entries! Now two roles are assigned to the part. If you do not see them immediately, close the mask once and open it again to display the list updated. You can edit the product or order part data by double clicking on the respective role. Insert role: In this window you can add a new role to a previously selected part/service. Module name: icastedt.mod. Classes: CX_ITEM_CAST.
