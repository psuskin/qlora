Although only one (variant) part is specified (\"sheet 4711\"), by additionally specifying the values of the characteristics, it is possible to describe different characteristics of one and the same variant part and thus define different, exactly described parts.   A variant part can thus be used like any other part in the system, with the difference that all values for characteristics in the characteristics list must always be specified.   The advantage now is that a variant part only has to be defined once in the system, only once as master information in the part master. Nevertheless, a large number of different versions of this variant part are available for further processing in the DP system. If you need sheet metal 4711 in length=100mm and width=50mm, but at another time you need the same sheet metal in length=30mm and width=12mm, you have to enter values for length and width, but you always use the other information of the variant part already stored in the system.   In principle, the characteristics of a variant part - as in our example of the sheet metal - can take any value, but valid value ranges can be assigned to the characteristics or attributes.\r\n",

A. Vazsonyi* coined the term jokingly, tracing the procedure back to the (non-existent) Italian mathematician Zepartzat Gozinto, whose name stands for \"the part that (=Zepartzat) goes into (=Gozinto)\".  Starting point are parts lists which describe the structure of parts. Let us assume we have an end product E1, which itself consists of the two assemblies B2 and B3 and these in turn consist of the assembly B1 and the parts T1, T2 and T3. The assembly B1 consists of the parts T1 and T2. The structure of the BOM has the following structure as a tree: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"398\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} As can be seen in this BOM view, assembly B1 and parts T1 and T2 occur several times, furthermore, parts T1 and T2 occur simultaneously at the 0. and the 1. production stage. The tree is not very clear due to this redundancy of parts and assemblies.  The  dispositive view (when are which parts needed for what?) of the use of parts(use or dispositive view), which is particularly important for production planning, is achieved by converting the tree into a network, the parts list network or gozintograph: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"400\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Each part and each assembly only occurs once and now only at a so-called MRP level. In ClassiX®, the level within a gozintograph is output the  other way round, the topmost - to be delivered - end products are always referred to as the so-called level 0 parts, subordinate parts belong to levels 1, 2, etc.  Summarised according to parts, the following list representation of the disposition of the parts results: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"402\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} The above graph can also be drawn as a Gantt chart: The representation from left to right is to express the  chronological sequence of the demand for parts.

Since an inventory is intended to represent a comparison/check of the (book) stocks in the DP system with the actual stocks in the warehouse, inventories are first generated from DP data. There are three different possibilities:   After the inventory document has been created, a count list can be printed, with which the actual count or inventory can then be carried out in the warehouse. Once the actual counted stocks have been entered in the count list, they are then entered in the inventory document.   After reconciliation of the count and the EDP book balances, the inventory document is posted. Depending on whether or not you wish to correct the stock, either only the difference amount is posted or the counted quantity is also saved in the system as a physical inventory quantity with date. Booked inventories can no longer be edited afterwards.   For detailed information on use, please refer to the module documentation of the inventory.  Inventory sampling: By means of an inventory sampling, the number of storage locations to be actually counted is to be reduced. For this purpose, the warehouse must first be analysed for suitability for an inventory sampling. This is carried out in the inventory sampling analysis module. In the same module, an inventory sampling can be carried out if it is suitable. Documents on the statistical procedures can be requested via your system partner.\r\n",
            "This is the description of the documentation for \"GESTIN - Inventory sampling\" from the module solutions_gestin-77: Reduce your inventory costs by up to 95%. Guided, efficient and simple.With GESTIN, you no longer have to count your entire warehouse as part of your year-end inventory. GESTIN only searches for a few, few count items for you: If the error of this sample is sufficiently small, your book inventory can be confirmed as inventory stock.The legislator has expressly permitted such a procedure. And of course GESTIN is certified by a renowned, internationally active auditing company.  The basic idea of inventory sampling is based on the assumption that the daily stock movements carried out in a warehouse (or only in a specific storage area) are  basically not or only slightly incorrect with regard to inventory management, and that the book inventory of a warehouse management system is therefore  basically correct.By means of a statistically prepared stock census - with only a few random samples - exactly this assumption is checked.If the deviation of this random sample count from the book inventory is within a framework recommended by auditors and auditing associations, the assumption of a fundamentally correct book inventory can be confirmed (extrapolated) for the entire warehouse examined, thus dispensing with a full inventory of the warehouse.On the one hand, this means that only those warehouses whose book inventory balances are  basically correct are eligible for inventory sampling. However, it is quite common to exclude from the statistical sampling those areas of a warehouse whose book inventory is known in advance to be rather inaccurate (e.g. general cut goods such as yard goods, residual material). For such storage areas a full inventory is still necessary.On the other hand, it is also generally assumed that a warehouse management system is fundamentally not error-free, so in the end it is also a question of measuring the quality of a warehouse management system. Here, too, recognised statistical methods are helpful. Inventory ProcessingGESTIN has been specially developed to simplify the implementation of an inventory for existing ERP or merchandise management systems. By means of a powerful interface, data from the leading inventory system can be transferred to the GESTIN software, where it can be further processed for statistical evaluation.GESTIN is an add-on to the comprehensive materials management modules in the AppsWarehouse® from ClassiX®.Import of book inventory data from the leading merchandise management systemSupport of  serial number and  batch managementInventory analysisInventory procedureStratificationSequential Test Random physical inventoryThe sample of parts and storage locations to be counted, drawn using recognised statistical methods, is issued as a count list. After counting and recording only this random sample, the result is extrapolated in a stratification, checked in a sequential test and - if the error rate is low compared to the book stock - the inventory is concluded as correct. Otherwise, the inventory sampling must be rejected.Recording a countCheck for successful samplingExtrapolation (for stratification)Test for acceptance or rejection (for sequential test)Comparison of the count data with the leading merchandise management systemQuestions and answers (FAQs) on the use of GESTINGeneral featuresIn addition to the special functionality for inventory sampling, GESTIN is characterised by the fact that it was developed on the CyberEnterprise digital platform.
