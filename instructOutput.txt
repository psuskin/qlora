This is the description of the module "cxTextCondition" with the name "Text module": Text modules can be used in ClassiX® in two different ways. On the one hand they can be used as conditions and attached to different documents, on the other hand they can be used as text modules in the literal sense, i.e. as letterhead or section in a letter, fax, etc. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxTextCondition" with the name "Text module" regarding Input window: Important for the characterisation of a text module is, above all, the type to which it is assigned and the documents for which it has been validated. In the selection list "Type" you can choose how you want to use the text module. If you want to use it in the literal sense, i.e. as letterhead etc., you set it as a "general text module". In this case you can always call it up to insert it in a letter, for example. If you use the text module as a condition, select one of the other two points, depending on whether you want to assign it to purchasing or sales. Once you have done this, you will notice that some checkboxes have been opened and set in the document group to select the documents for which the text module is to be valid. For example, if you have a sales condition that is only valid for quotation and order, you can remove the check marks from the other two checkboxes. If you now want to insert a text module in a delivery note, the text module just created (only set for offer and order) is not available for selection. You should make sure that when converting documents, such as creating an order from an offer, only the text modules that are valid for an order are taken over.

The data set here are taken into account when generating IntraStat messages, but can still be changed there. Column Description Determination logic Default setting Date Output of the declaration period of the currently selected list Posting date of the header document - This date is also used to assign the IntraStat declaration to the posting period Document Output of type (delivery note or goods receipt) and number of the goods document Traffic direction A "D" stands for dispatched, exported goods (delivery note), an "A" for imported goods (goods receipt) Delivery note = "D" (delivery) Goods receipt = "A" (arrival) A direct delivery document can be either "A" or "D". The rules are as follows: If the supplier outside the home country is located in a country within the EU and this supplier delivers to the home country, this is type "A" -- It is imported from the EU to the home country. If this foreign supplier also delivers to another EU country, this document is not taken into account. If the supplier is a national and delivers to another EU country, the type is "D". The EU is supplied from the home country Example for direct deliveries (source chapter 9.1 of the official filling-in instructions): Situation (intra-Community triangular trade) A German company D sells to a Belgian company goods which D has acquired in France. The goods are shipped directly from France to Belgium. Question: Where should Intrastat declarations be made? Answer: France (dispatch) and Belgium (arrival) require one Intrastat declaration each, whereas Germany does not. In principle, Intrastat declarations are only to be submitted in the EU Member States which are physically affected by the movement of goods as the Member State of dispatch or the Member State of arrival. Country of destination/dispatch Country of destination (or country of dispatch in the case of incoming goods/direct deliveries) to or from which the goods have been moved Delivery note: Country of recipient (delivery address) Goods receipt: Country of the supplier Direct delivery: - For direction of traffic "A" country of the supplier - For direction of traffic "D" country of the consignee See also page 16 box 8a+b of the official instructions for completion . Region of origin / region of destination Region of origin (or region of destination in the case of incoming goods / direct deliveries) of the IntraStat notification Federal state of the client's location Mode of transport Route of transport of the document. Default setting is "Road transport" Transaction type Classification of the goods movement (specified by IntraStat) Default setting always "Final purchase / sale See also page 47 Annex 2 of the Official Filling Instructions . Part Number Number of the part belonging to the part roll If a part is specified on the document, it is entered here. The weight of the delivery is then determined from this part, unless it is explicitly stated there. Goods number Goods number of the part When booking IntraStat messages via the header document, the goods number is left blank by default to avoid errors. An error message "No commodity code" appears When the individual items of documents are loaded, the commodity number is searched for via the part master of the part connected to the document. This is taken over if found, otherwise it also remains empty. Attention: If the commodity code stored on the part is not recorded in the system as a combined nomenclature, the number is not taken from the part and an error message "No commodity code" is displayed. See also page 25, box 13 of the official filling-in instructions . Description Description of the part Weight Weight in its standard unit of measurement (unless a special unit of measurement is required for the specified goods number according to the list of goods) Delivery note: Net weight from colliding data of the delivery note header or sum of all items (part weight * quantity) Goods receipt: Total of all items (part weight * quantity) Direct delivery: sum of all items (part weight * quantity). The weight can only be entered if a valid commodity code has been selected, as the commodity code determines whether the weight must be indicated in a so-called "special unit of measurement". Quantity in supplementary units If it has been determined via the commodity code that this group of goods is not to be reported via its weight but with its quantity (e.g. household coffee machines), the quantity of the delivery in the supplementary unit must be entered here. To be taken from the quantity delivered of the transaction to be declared. See also Chapter 5, page 25, box 17 of the official filling-in instructions . Re. value The invoice amount in €, to be specified for certain types of business Delivery note: Value of the previous order item without freight and packaging costs. If the item itself is not calculated because a superior item has a fixed sum, there may be deviations between the value determined here and the value actually calculated. In these cases a warning message is issued on the IntraStat message. The invoice value is determined from the account assignment of the order item (first 3 elements of the accounted.amount vector = without freight / packaging ). If this vector is not present at the order item (no direct invoice successor item, item below set item or below price group), the order item value per unit is determined and multiplied by the delivery note item quantity. Goods receipt: Value from the order item without surcharges Direct delivery: Value from the order item without surcharges Stat. value This field does not have to be filled in if the goods transaction is a sale (key 11 in the transaction type field) or a commission or consignment transaction (key 12 in the transaction type field) and the total value of the corresponding shipments in the previous or current year did not exceed €42 million. This field is filled with the value of the Re. value field as default Errors/remarks Error messages and other remarks that are automatically written by this machine when the data is created.

This is followed in the third column by the supplier name and the order number belonging to the order item. Price: This is the price negotiated in a supply agreement with this supplier, which has become or will become valid as of the date below. Only in the case of real supply agreements is this price shown in green; in the case of movements that have passed through a supplier with whom no supply agreement has been made, this price is grey. The price is also grey if the supplier does not have its own price on its supplier agreement (price type: no value). In this case, the currently valid price is taken from the order item master record. Last price: The last price of the order item with date at this supplier is indicated here. Display mode The display mode at the bottom of the window is a filter for whether only supplier agreements or all transaction data are to be displayed in the list. Movement data is saved for each supplier who has supplied this part once. more on the subject of supplier agreements Movements in the list are displayed completely in grey/black and are thus immediately distinguishable from supplier agreements! You insert the buyers for the trading goods on the 'Customers' card. Click on 'Insert' to open the search mask of the customer master, from which you can select or create the corresponding customer with a double click. A small window then opens in which you can enter the sales agreement for the customer.

In the 'Edit' menu, the document type can be changed to label. The style sheet and the list of blocks are not available in this input window. An OLE object is provided for this purpose, in which the content of the label can be specified (the Word document should be the size of the label). In the application area, a label type can be selected via Type. The second option is to print a label sheet (A4). A label type can be selected via Type in the application area. The label grid must be specified in the module list box (module: label grid) and then modules with the contents can be inserted. When selecting a label raster module, the number of separating columns in a line must be taken into account. This is created manually in the 'configuration.counter' attribute of the document. In example 2 and 3 there are additional cells between the individual cells as separating columns. In order to be able to skip these, it must be known in advance how many are present in a row. If this is not done or is incorrectly specified, the content of the label is written into the separating columns. Example 1: Line without separating columns: configuration.counter = 0 Example 2: Line with one separating column: configuration.counter = 1 Example 3: Line with two separator columns: configuration.counter = 2 The entire contents of the label are placed in one cell at a time.

This is the description of the module "jobssing" with the name "Sequence of operations": A work plan consists of individual work sequences or operations. This module is used to record individual work sequences, i.e. work sequences that are only to be carried out at the workstation/resource specified in this work sequence. Only the set-up time and the piece time can be entered as a formula - and therefore variable. If a sequence of operations is to be defined variably with regard to the workstation/resource, a conditional sequence of operations can be inserted into the work plan. This is the description of the functionality of the module "jobssing" with the name "Sequence of operations" regarding Distribution or calculation of production costs: In principle, the production costs for a part are divided into two differently valued parts: Labour costs and material costs As a standard, the additional costs incurred in addition to wages and materials, e.g. for purchasing or stock management of the required parts, are included in the overheads. These are stored globally in the client. However, the following approach is preferable in order to be able to calculate production costs precisely according to other costs incurred during production, such as machine running costs and programming costs, without having to include all costs invisibly in overheads: In the part or at the work plan position, a material characteristic must be defined which contains the costs for e.g. the machine costs per hour according to the following format costs = 120€/h (see below in the picture in the work sequence) You must therefore create a material characteristic for each cost element. The characteristic can also be stored directly on variant parts and calculate itself from other constraints (calculated or conditional characteristics). To be able to take these costs into account, a formula in the resource of the work sequence is necessary (in the picture the standard costs of the working group): Standard costs = formula = costs+(40€/1h) Since the formulae do not know any compound units, instead of 40€/h --> write 40€/1h and put this in brackets. The machine costs per hour specified via the material characteristic are now added to the standard machine costs per hour. In order to check whether the costs are actually there without any error occurring, the formula can be extended by a query as follows In this case, the system queries in advance whether the costs have been found and otherwise uses the value 0?, whose unit is based on the next component for further calculation. In the parts precalculation we then immediately see the result: The marked line is our work sequence, which has received wage costs of 1.600€ for 600 minutes (10 hours) (120€ machine running costs + 40€ standard costs = 160€ per hour * 10 hours = 1600€). This is the description of the functionality of the module "jobssing" with the name "Sequence of operations" regarding Set-up time / piece time / throughput time: The times can be given as a value, formula or conditional table in the parts list. Examples of values that can be used in a formula or condition in the sequence of operations:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "jobssing" with the name "Sequence of operations" regarding Functionality: This window is used to maintain individual work sequences or operations. You can select a sequence directly by entering the desired sequence number in the sequence field and confirming with RETURN. To show that this sequence of operations is an external production you have to select a supplier under resources. In addition, a unit of performance that represents this external performance and must be defined at the supplier. In this case of external production there are several rules to be observed, so that e.g. the deregistration of the PDC hours but also the preliminary costing of parts runs smoothly: A further description of external production within the work plans can be found here. The second tab "Document directory references" allows you to link the position to document directories. A document could thus serve as a quality assurance instruction, for example.

This is the description of the module "costsobj" with the name "Cost unit (project)": Along with cost types and cost centres, cost objects are part of cost accounting. However, the term cost object is also used synonymously with the term sales opportunity (marketing/sales), the term framework agreement (purchasing) and the term internal cost object (e.g. R&D), depending on the specialist area. A cost object thus describes a business object to which a wide variety of inventory objects and a wide variety of documents can be assigned.The documents assigned to a cost object, i.e. the documents posted with a cost object can also contain costs/services. Thus, costs/services can be assigned to a cost object either directly via financial accounting or via special (cost) documents (e.g. time sheets).A (specialised) sales cost unit can be assigned inventory data of a plant (industrial plant, machine, part (e.g. for development projects)) and/or a business partner(customer, interested party, operator) or an operative partner(interested party, operator).Transaction data such as offers or orders can also be assigned to a sales cost unit. In this case, a "project" is thus the superordinate node for various offer or order documents. Usually at the beginning of a quotation or order processing there is the definition of a project, with specification of the external and internal project manager, the assignment to a plant and possibly also the determination of a first rough cost framework(order/sales planning) and a time schedule(network), which can be imported directly from a planning by means of MS-Projects and can also be reconciled with it.Using certain buttons in the toolbar, quotations and orders can therefore be created directly from a sales cost unit. This is the description of the functionality of the module "costsobj" with the name "Cost unit (project)" regarding Framework contracts and call orders: Blanket orders can also be defined above a sales cost object. The sales cost object takes over the definition of the outline agreement, for example, the partner and the contract period are defined. The "Framework contract data" tab is used to define the items, the total quantity agreed in each case and the price negotiated (project price). For this purpose the module of customer agreements is used. The call-off orders are recorded as normal sales orders, which are assigned to the outline agreement as cost objects. The creation of a call-off order is initiated via the sales cost object. For this purpose, the articles which are called off by the customer are selected in the list. Then the sales order with the order items is created via the context menu "Create call order". The respective quantity called off and the delivery date must be entered in the order item. In the customer agreement, the order items called up are listed in the "Receipts" tab. In addition, the quantity called off is displayed in the tab "Framework agreement". This is the description of the functionality of the module "costsobj" with the name "Cost unit (project)" regarding Input window: This window is used for maintaining sales cost objects. You can select a sales cost object by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". The editing mask consists of the tab for entering the project data, the tab for displaying additional data for the project, the tab for displaying the documents assigned to the project, the tab for editing the framework agreement data and the tab for editing the documents and/or other associations assigned to a project. This is the description of the functionality of the module "costsobj" with the name "Cost unit (project)" regarding Change sales cost unit settings with Wizzard: With this wizard, settings can be set for a group of selected sales cost objects in one. The selection of the sales cost objects can still be changed while the wizard is open. The checkboxes in front of the groups "Category", "Status", "Business field" and "Type" can be used to show or hide the data fields. Data fields that are shown are changed in the sales cost units by the Wizzard. These groups are not changed by hiding them. This is the description of the functionality of the module "costsobj" with the name "Cost unit (project)" regarding List window: Serves to search and list cost units. This is the description of the functionality of the module "costsobj" with the name "Cost unit (project)" regarding Status: The status of the insurance provider defines the different statuses that an insurance provider can have. The status is defined via the evaluation group "COST_OBJECTIVE_STATE". This evaluation group can contain both simple structure nodes and structure statuses . In the case of structure status, the status is automatically determined by transition conditions in further structure statuses. All simple structure nodes are displayed for selection and the structure statuses are displayed at the beginning of the status chain. Thus, for example, the structure term "COST_OBJECTIVE_STATE" could be structured as follows: - Completed - Releases In this example, the statuses FINISHED and RELEASED can be set in the cost object by the user. FINISHED blocks the complete processing of the cost unit. No additional data can be added to the cost unit. Existing data cannot be edited. RELEASED releases the processing of the cost unit. Additional data can be added to the cost unit. Existing data can be edited. {img fileId="532" thumb="box" width="100%"} Options for the processing and use of the parts can be stored at the individual statuses. These options are stored as attributes at the structure node (see also Attributes/characteristics and in particular the paragraph: Attributes with control function).

This is the description of the module "processes_variant02" with the name "Variant routings and parts lists": A variant bill of material and a variant routing are characterised by the fact that they consist of conditional items, which are defined by formulas depending on attributes. Only when a bill of material is exploded are these other items exploded to "real" bill of material items and the master bill of material becomes a production bill of material. Thus only the master data can contain upperen. The attributes that are significantly involved in the specification are mainly taken from the preceding document of the order item as well as the other higher order items. In this way, similarly constructed parts can use one and the same bill of material although they are not identically constructed. Example {img type="fileId" fileId="330" thumb="box" width="100%"}In this example, variant control is carried out using the attributes DICKE and SORTE_METALL.Without the variant parts list, you would have to create at least two parts lists, as the raw sheet metal differs depending on the type of installation. (And two parts of course, if there were no variant parts). However, ClassiX® uses the upper option, as the example shows. In this case there are two variants, which are dependent on the attribute THICK. Depending on the attribute, the part is then used for 3.0mm or 5.0mm. The main advantage here is the maintenance of the parts lists. Since similar parts lists are combined, the processing effort is minimised, although the creation may be more complex/difficult.

This is the description of the module "origpart" with the name "List of originating products": With this module, proofs of origin can be created for individual items of customer or warehouse orders. This is a list of all those purchased parts for which the respective suppliers cannot explicitly provide proof of valid certificates of origin (origin EU) at the time of delivery (the value of the non-originating goods in a delivery item determines the amount of import duties for some countries). Such declarations can be made by companies acting as "approved exporters" by the customs authorities. Alternatively, a list of the purchased parts clearly declared as originating, as well as a list of all purchased parts - regardless of their originating status - can be issued. The following information on the origin of a product can be entered(if an identifier is no longer valid from the date - as it is older than one year - the system will place a "?" in front of the identifier for further verification. e.g. "?N"): Description Identification Original product U not originating N Reference to invoice R not specified - Requested A With regard to the country of origin, the following information can be entered(if an identifier is no longer valid from the date - as it is older than one year - the system will place a "?" in front of the identifier for further verification. e.g. "?DE"): Description Identification Country code of the country of origin DE (Germany), CH (Switzerland), not specified - Various countries are eligible #. This is the description of the functionality of the module "origpart" with the name "List of originating products" regarding Functionality: Processing starts by dragging and dropping the order items (or groups) for which such a proof of origin is to be created into the list window. There are two buttons (see below) to select either sales or stock order items. The items selected in this way are identified - depending on their processing in the logistical business process - as purchased or manufactured parts, and in the process as either taken from stock or directly scheduled. Thus, not only the master information of a part is assumed: A part, which may be a production part by default, could also - e.g. due to capacity bottlenecks - have been directly procured from a supplier for the order in question, i.e. an order was triggered for this part in this order item. In this case, the part is therefore to be regarded as a purchased part and no longer as a production part. It can therefore happen that a stock-keeping production part has been removed from the warehouse for an order. In order to be able to trace the origin, however, the parts list of this production part must be exploded during the evaluation to see which parts with which origin this production part consists of. Note: Please note that when evaluating the proof of origin before the start, the system-wide validity date is set either to the reference date set manually via the options, or to the creation date of the earliest invoice of the order. If an invoice has not yet been created for the order, the order creation date is used. If the evaluation is aborted, the system date will NOT be reset to the current date, please make sure to reset the system date to the current date. This is done via the main menu "System-->Change date-->Session date", there the field "Validity date". If it is determined for a purchased part on an order position that there is neither an order nor a stock withdrawal for this, an error message is issued. Similarly, an error message is issued for a production part if there is neither a stock withdrawal nor a production-specific parts list. The further processing and evaluation of the parts is shown in the following table: A. Rules for determining the supplier, price and proof of origin for purchased parts held in stock: B. Rules for determining the supplier, price and proof of origin for purchased parts not kept in stock:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "origpart" with the name "List of originating products" regarding List window: List After selecting the items to be processed, the list is built up. In the following section you will find some explanations of the structure/columns of the list. The listing of each position starts with a blue-green (cyan) line, in which In the following lines - depending on the setting of the filters - all parts necessary to deliver the item (parts list information) are output. Some more detailed explanations of these columns follow: Column "Order price It is always rounded to 2 decimal places if the order price is greater than 0.01. It is always rounded to 4 decimal places if the order price is less than 0.01, provided that this does not make it zero. Procurement" column At the end of the list, the totals for the two (according to the 10% and 40% rule) value shares of non-originating goods, their share of the sales value and the total sum of the value of non-originating goods - with their share of the sales value - are again displayed. The sum line "Control value of originating goods" shows the value of the parts that were recognised by the system as originating goods. This is the description of the functionality of the module "origpart" with the name "List of originating products" regarding Option window: All settings can be made here. The window can only be closed with the "OK" button. Each time the main window is opened, the options described here are reset to the default settings.

This is the description of the module "olapCustomerList" with the name "Customers sales article statistics": With this module a customer/ sales item or a sales item/customer statistic can be created for certain periods of time. The basis of these statistics are 2-dimensional OLAP data cubes (see also monitors) between customers and sales item objects. Depending on the selection of the - primary - dimension (i.e. the point of entry) into the statistics, the second remaining dimension is the so-called secondary dimension. If you choose"customers" as the primary dimension, the "sales items" are the secondary sub-dimension and vice versa.Depending on the selection of the primary dimension (customer or sales item), the total values of the statistics can vary. This is because sales can be made with "customers" even without sales articles (e.g. when using text articles or fixed values in orders or outgoing invoices). A statistic according to "Customers" can therefore be larger in total than the "same" statistic according to "Sales articles".The data is updated every time a quotation, an order or an invoice is saved. Whether the values are shown in the totals of the statistics depends on the status of the respective documents. Below is a list of the statuses that are included in the statistics totals for the various documents (the documents themselves are nevertheless always kept in the corresponding data cubes, only the values are not always added up):Status offersOffer submitted (OFFER_SUBMITTED)Offer partially converted into order (OFFER_CONFIRMED_IN_PART)Offer completely taken over as order (OFFER_CONFIRMED)Orders in statusOrder confirmed (SALES_ORDER_CONFIRMED)Job stopped (SALES_ORDER_STOPPED)Job waiting for acceptance (SALES_ORDER_WAITING_FOR_ACCEPTION)Mission accomplished (SALES_ORDER_IMPLEMENTED)Invoices/credit notesAll registered invoices/credit notes are included in the statistics (registered credit notes are only considered if they are issued for a customer. Credit notes for commission recipients are therefore excluded, for example). Values for packaging and freight are distributed proportionally among the sales items (if available in the invoice or credit memo), therefore there may be differences in the distributions (value of goods - packaging - freight) between the values displayed in these statistics and the values displayed in the list of invoices or credit memos. The totals are of course identical.All statistic values are held in local currency only. This is the description of the functionality of the module "olapCustomerList" with the name "Customers sales article statistics" regarding List window: In this window, after selecting the criteria, the customer/sales item statistics are displayed.

This is the description of the module "objctsql" with the name "English:Object Query": Based on SQL (Standard Query Language), this module can be used to query data from the object-oriented database of ClassiX®. A common use of SQL is to output certain data fields (using the SELECT statement) from a table (specified with FROM) as a result list under certain conditions (specified with WHERE). Similarly, a list of objects can be selected in this module from which data can be output (FROM "REP collection"). The objects of such a list belong to a certain class or a class inherited from this class. Therefore you have to consider which ("SELECT") data fields you select, furthermore you can query any free data fields (slots) from the objects. Due to the use of an object-oriented database, the selected data fields - nested within themselves - can be references (POINTER or REL_1M) to other objects. This module supports the construction of such data access paths by simple navigation to the referenced classes, such as reference_to_object_1.reference_to_object_2.reference_to_object_3.target_data_field_in_object_3 (the individual references are connected with "." each other). Since such access paths can also contain function or method calls, the classes also output their methods. Once you have selected your ("SELECT") data fields, you can further specify the selection of data to be displayed by a ("WHERE") specification, which must be specified here in the form of a query expression or InstantView® script. The result of the script must always return either TRUE/an Object/1 or FALSE/INVALID/0. After entering all criteria, the result list is displayed in a separate window as an object list. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objctsql" with the name "English:Object Query" regarding Selection window: In this window, the "SELECT", "FROM" and "WHERE" data analogue to SQL are entered. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objctsql" with the name "English:Object Query" regarding Object list: This window is used to list the objects selected by the query. The data fields defined by "SELECT" are output as columns of the list. Double-clicking on an entry in the list opens the edit mask of the currently selected object.

This is the description of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file": Evaluation: Performance What should be taken into account when evaluating the logfiles, or what are indications of code that can be optimised? Evaluation: System crashes Blockade trigger - tree view This module is used to create various evaluations of log files and display them accordingly. The files are read out according to sessions (start of ClassiX® until end or crash). The remaining entries of the log file are thus assigned to the created sessions. If additional dbProf files are read in, these entries are assigned to the sessions by the OS Client ID, if possible. An option can be used to set whether or not the previous sessions should be reset before each import. If this option is not set, many days in a row can easily be read in. Either several selected files, entire folders can be read in (subfolders are automatically taken into account) or a time period can be specified in which all log files are automatically searched and loaded. Specifying a time period is best suited in MorphIT, because the MorphIT user does not have to worry about the location of the log files and whether they are on the same computer, especially since in this case no files have to be uploaded. The automatic reading of log files depending on the time period requires that the log files are stored in a temporal subfolder structure, i.e. the following option must be activated in logging.ini. log4cplus.OrganizeLogsByDate=true Selecting individual files also allows you to view files for sessions from different time periods and points side by side. In addition to the sessions and user logins, certain events such as deadlocks, timeouts, crashes, etc. are additionally summarised in monitors across sessions. After reading in, all sessions are displayed in the session list with the most important data. A session is opened by double-clicking on it and you can see what happened. In the Statistics tab, graphical evaluations can be created flexibly. The monitors can be assigned to the diagrams as desired. There is a maximum of 3 diagrams, whereby only one monitor can be assigned to a diagram. You can drag and drop the monitors into the diagram areas or select a monitor and then click on the corresponding "Add monitor" button. For dbProf statistics, the desired evaluation can be selected after a double click. In the X-axis option area, the evaluation variant can be selected, whereby the transactions are evaluated according to time or date. In the case of an evaluation based on time, all transactions are summarised according to their time, so that one can see, for example, which events have occurred at which time of day. In this case, it makes sense to load or select only sessions from a single day. The time span and the period length of the evaluation can be specified in the Options section. The period length self-explanatory determines the accuracy of the statistics. For statistics accurate to the minute, a period length of 1 minute should be selected, but this could lead to extensive graphs. If, on the other hand, you want to make a summary evaluation over several days, you should select the option by date. All transactions of a particular monitor are summarised in days and displayed graphically. You could also select the time of day under Options, outside which the transactions are not considered. The monitor user has the special feature that besides the normal evaluation of the login, the maximum number of simultaneous use of ClassiX on one day is graphically displayed. Either "All sessions" or "Selected sessions only" can be set as an option. With the option "All sessions" all loaded sessions are used for the evaluation, otherwise only the sessions selected in the session list are used. The option "All sessions" can be used to read and compare only dbProf files of different days. So it is not necessary to read in all files from each day. For any number of monitors the transactions can be viewed within a time span. This makes it easier to understand which events are interdependent within a limited period of time. In the tab Blocks/ Crashes/Locks the transactions mentioned above for the selected sessions are displayed. The locking conflicts can be viewed in a summary by "Locked By" (Who is locking the others?) and segment. Red lines in a list or also called ListView Fatals (crashes within a ListView) are displayed in the same tab. RO and RW long distance transactions are grouped by location and displayed in the Long distance TXNs tab. The average duration and the average number of pages read are also displayed. IV faults are displayed in a separate tab. This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding Evaluation: Performance: The following options are available for evaluating performance and determining the causes of good/bad performance:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding What should be taken into account when evaluating the log files, or what are indications of code that can be optimised?: 1.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding Evaluation: System crashes: For the evaluation of the system crashes the log files of the clients must be loaded, those of the server (cxdbprof.log) can be ignored. By double clicking on the monitor "Crashes" in the list of monitors all crashes are displayed. In the list each crash is described by three columns. (Error message of the crash, if a deadlock has occurred before, output of the C++ stack) In order to record a tendency of the number of crashes or to determine the increase/decrease of errors due to a difference, it is important to record key figures. This output of the key figures is done by clicking the corresponding button. By transferring the key figures daily to Excel, it is possible to make statements about the course of events. The following key figures are available:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding List window: To carry out an evaluation, any number of log files must first be selected. The log files are first evaluated according to sessions. A session is the duration from the start of ClassiX® until the termination or system crash. If another ClassiX® instance is started during a session, a counter is incremented in the current session. If the option "Reset sessions each time log files are read in" is not set, log files can be read in one after the other without losing the previously read in sessions. If a file ends before a session is finished, the session end time is set to the time of the last event. If a log file does not start when ClassiX® starts, a session is created that takes the start time of the first event of the file. If errors occur during reading in, these can be viewed later in the window Errors during reading in. Columns of the session list: Double-click on a session to open the session window. The evaluations for the lists, blockades/crashes/locks, ListView Fatals, long distance TXNs and IV errors are always immediately created and displayed for the currently selected sessions. This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding ListView Fatals: This list displays the ListView Fatals (Hard crashes within a ListView - Red lines) for the selected sessions. If these occur more than once at one point, they are displayed together. By pressing a Double-clicking on a list entry displays the contained transactions in the Contained Transactionswindow. Instantview error This list displays the Instantview errors for the selected sessions. Identical errors are summarised. By double-clicking on a list entry, the contained transactions are displayed in the Contained Transactions window. This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding Session: This window displays all transactions included in the session sorted by timestamp. Transactions that are held in a monitor appear in red in the list (except for the dbProf statistics). This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding Included transactions: This window displays all transactions included in the period sorted by time stamp. This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding Locking Summary: Locking conflicts are summarised by Locked by and by segment.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding Evaluation: In this window the diagrams of the evaluation are displayed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding Blockade trigger - tree view: If users create time-consuming bookings, it can happen that other users are hindered in their activities, as individual data is exclusively blocked by the booking. The other users then wait for the end of the transaction before they can continue. They only notice this circumstance by an extended duration of the action they are about to perform. Such behaviour is called blocking. As long as the user is waiting for the release of his data, it is possible that he has already locked data for himself, for which other users must then wait. Similar to the snowball system, a network of blockades could develop in an unfavourable case, which is all triggered by the time-consuming booking of the first user. To be able to find such time-consuming bookings that block many users, this tree view is available. Here you can see who the first blocker was, who he blocked, and who was blocked by the other users. Users who have only been blocked without triggering the blockade themselves are not displayed at the top level of the tree. The behaviour of the snowball system must be prevented by targeted improvements to the source code - this tree view should help to locate the critical parts of the programme.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding System crashes: If the log level "FATAL" appears in a log file, this indicates that the machine has crashed. The next message with log level "ERROR" is the crash message that appears on the screen. The current session is closed and for this current transaction (crash message) the data field "settings" is displayed. The only exception is a "FATAL" from the logger "cx.listview". With this one, the system does not crash because the ListView catches it. If the system crashes without an error message, the last transaction (LogLevel "FATAL") is regarded as the end of the session and displayed in the list of crashes. (StopAllSessionsOfLogFile) investigation: + cx.app INFO "Signal caught: SIGABRT" + cx.app ERROR + cx.main FATAL + FATAL session end.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_salespricing" with the name "Sales pricing" regarding General: ClassiX® offers a high degree of variability in sales pricing. Thus, prices can not only be stored on the article, but also defined individually for customers (customer agreements) or customer groups. In addition, there are extensive possibilities to define discounts/surcharges and over/under prices. The variability is rounded off by the fact that all prices and conditions can be defined using conditional tables and formulas. When creating a price or for example a discount, please use the following diagram to find the right solution in ClassiX. For example, to define a special price of a sales item for a defined customer group you will be guided directly to the customer group price (3). {img type="fileId" fileId="316" thumb="box" width="100%"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_salespricing" with the name "Sales pricing" regarding Formation of a selling price: In the simplest case the price is a simple value per quantity independent of any variable. The price becomes variable through the use of a formula or price table, as the price is now formed depending on various attributes/data fields. In addition to the basic price, the price can be assigned surcharges and discounts. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_salespricing" with the name "Sales pricing" regarding Customer price agreement: Customer agreements can be reached via the sales role on the one hand and via the customer on the other. In the sales article, you can see the agreements which have been made with which customers for this article and the customer's condon for this. To create a price agreement, insert a customer in the customer tab of the sales role by clicking the "Insert" button. The price agreement is created automatically and the agreed price can be entered directly. (Info: Besides the price you can also enter the customer's article number here). The same functions (price history, detailed processing, price tables, ) are available for processing the price of customer agreements as for processing the item price. --- If the article is now inserted in an offer/order to the corresponding customer, the price of the agreement is taken over instead of the standard price. {img type="fileId" fileId="318" thumb="box" width="100%"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_salespricing" with the name "Sales pricing" regarding Customer conditions: In the "Conditions" tab in the customer editing window, it is possible to define not only shipping, delivery and payment conditions etc., but also discounts and surcharges. If an offer/order is directed to this customer, these conditions will be included in the document. If a surcharge/discount is declared as list price related, it will not be shown in the print and the reduction/increase in value will be allocated to the item price. The "hidden" condition thus influences the sales price without the customer being informed of this.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "processes_salespricing" module, based on the provided description:

1. How do I create a special price for a specific customer group in ClassiX?
2. Can I define different prices for different quantities of the same product in ClassiX?
3. What types of discounts and surcharges can I apply to sales items in ClassiX?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_sales_masterdata" with the name "Sales - Master data" regarding Master data: As usual, the master data of the sales department consists of a customer master and an article master. In ClassiX® the customer base is accessed via the 'Customer' icon. This opens the search mask of the customer base from which you can select existing customers or create new customers by clicking on 'New'. The article master consists of the sales types, sales articles, spare parts and service articles. This makes it possible to transparently display even products that are manufactured in many variants. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_sales_masterdata" with the name "Sales - Master data" regarding Sales set: Sales types can, for example, be end products that are made up of several assemblies. Conditional individual parts in sets Conditional individual parts can be included in sets. Characteristics can be assigned to these conditional individual parts, which later appear in the offer or order items. If no characteristics were entered for these conditional individual parts, the quotation or order item automatically takes the characteristics of the selected individual part from the parts master. Characteristics of the lower parts When sub-parts are added to sets, all characteristics of the selected part are copied from the part master into the characteristics of the new sub-position of the set. These can now be set as desired and are then valid for all quotation/order items created from this set, if the characteristics have not been explicitly defined and thus overwritten. Calculation and quantity calculation for main and sub-items There are five types (Types) of how subitems are assembled with the main item (see the "Type" field displayed on the first tab "Offer/Order item" if a main item has been loaded); this defines the pricing rules and quantity calculation.

This is the description of the module "attrslot" with the name "Preset attribute": A preset attribute wraps a dynamic data field with a value specification. This value is offered each time the preset attribute is used, but can then be overwritten individually. The type of presetting depends on the (data) type of the wrapped dynamic data field. For example, if the type is a STRING (character string), you can specify a text or leave the field empty. For example, if the type is CX_VALUE, you can specify the number of decimal places and the unit for the value. For enumeration types (enumerations: ENUMCHAR or ENUMSHORT) the value tables stored in the system (with binding to the dynamic data field) are offered for presetting. However, these tables can also be individually overwritten by the preset characteristics. The property of preset characteristics to manage their own tables also applies to other data types. For example, for a dynamic data field of type CX_VALUE, you can specify a table with values for the "width", such as "100 mm", "200mm" and "300mm". These values are then offered each time the preset attribute is used. If you want to allow only these values to be entered, you can do so by clicking on the "Exclusive" button. You can find more information in the topic Features. Attention: Attribute values are only supported in the formulas up to a maximum of 100 characters!.

This is the description of the module "txnhisto" with the name "Document history": The document history provides an overview of a transaction and the order of its subsequent documents. This enables a chronological overview which shows the chronological sequence of the individual transactions. Each document can be opened by double-clicking on it, or selected by single click. The possibility of displaying associations and transaction documents of the header document and the documents under items means that no important documents are lost in documents with different versions and levels just because they were linked incorrectly. {img type="fileId" fileId="438" thumb="box" width="100%"} Booked in: The list "Posted in" shows all monitors, states and accounts in which the currently selected document is posted. If a state is selected in this list, the graphical process history can be called up via the context menu. This shows which states in the assigned business process (workflow) this document has already passed through and which are still to come. This information is taken from the context of the document and interpreted. If, for example, the part is a part that must be inspected by master definition via a QA document after goods receipt, this QA step is also displayed in the open states. More on this topic in the documentation of process routes. associations: For each document, it is possible to link it with documents from the document master, local documents and, in the case of quotations/orders (+items), also operations. This is controlled via the context menu on the "Associations" list. There are three options to choose from here:Transaction: A transaction is created for the document and linked to it. For offers/orders, this document is automatically registered in the activity folder of the cost unit (project). The subject line of the created transaction is provided with the item number and supplemented by the internal database address of the item.(This is required so that a possible recipient of a mail created in this way can dragthis mail onto the ClassiX® background and the corresponding item opens immediately. This way the recipient knows immediately which position it is about and does not have to search for a long time (not implemented yet!!!)). For more information, please refer to the transaction document. Document (local): A document is simply attached to the document object and copied into the database. This copy of the document cannot be used for any other document and must be copied into the database again. In this way the same documents are created several times in the database. Document master (global): Via this menu item it is possible to create document copies or to use previously created copies for this document as well. For more information, please refer to the document master. With the help of the two buttons 'Fold all in (or out)' the whole tree can be viewed or folded up again. This is the description of the functionality of the module "txnhisto" with the name "Document history" regarding Functionality: Displays the history of a document (transaction). The right mouse button opens the context menu for further display of a document selected in the list.

This is the description of the module "resolbom" with the name "Exploded (production) parts list": This module is used to process order-specific production parts lists. These are the bills of materials which are generated by the system by exploding master bills of materials, taking into account the characteristics and their values specified from a customer order, warehouse order or advance requirement. The term "explosion" refers to the selection of entries from, for example, variant parts list items or the calculation of quantities and/or characteristic values. As a special feature it should be noted that in the so-called tree view of the parts list, the calculated total quantity is displayed for each parts list entry, although only individual quantities are entered. If you change a quantity on any level in the parts list, all quantities on the levels below are automatically updated, i.e. multiplied out and the required total quantities are displayed. Normally, ClassiX® assumes that at least a "rough" variant bill of material is defined for each part in the system. This avoids having to define and enter a separate master bill of material for each special case in advance. Within the scope of technical processing and design, this order-specific exploded production bill of materials is then adapted or designed more precisely with regard to parts, characteristic values and quantities. The changes are then only valid for the respective order item. To quickly create new parts lists, it is possible to drag a part from the parts master into the production parts list structure using the mouse. This way only the quantity needs to be adjusted and if necessary the new item needs to be exploded (if it is an assembly - red gear symbol!). In principle, however, it is also possible to completely redefine the order-specific production parts list. Note: If, for example, within an order-specific production bill of materials - which was exploded or generated from a "standard" bill of materials - somewhere on a lower structural level, one part is exchanged for another part, then this production bill of materials no longer "matches" the original "standard" bill of materials. Basically, this is then also a completely new assembly, in general terms, all higher-level parts have been redefined as a result - although they still have their original part number in this production bill of materials. This procedure should therefore only be used in order to be able to quickly and pragmatically comply with any customer request for (simple) "exotic" parts (e.g. exchanging the screws for other screw heads). As the production parts lists are retained in the system, it is always possible to trace what has been installed where: However, the order itself must always be queried in the system. It is therefore recommended to make changes to production BOMs only for variant parts (the "uniqueness" of the BOM is anyway only ensured by the characteristic values defined in the order) and possibly to mark a characteristic of such parts with a version. Attention: Due to changes in the production bill of materials, it can happen that the routing of the parent part no longer matches the current production bill of materials. In order to be able to find out these items, there is an item"Display number of entries (production bill of material/master bill of material)" in the view options in the menu "Edit". If this option is set, information is displayed after each line in the production parts list tree: (x/x). The front x represents the number of parts list entries of the exploded production parts list below this entry. The back x represents the number of parts list entries of the master parts list of this entry. In this way, rough changes to the exploded production parts lists compared to the master parts lists can be detected. This is the description of the functionality of the module "resolbom" with the name "Exploded (production) parts list" regarding Special work plan: On each item of the exploded production bill of material, a special routing / one-off routing can be stored which is used for the following production order. In the same way, the total time of all work sequences from this special routing later on in the parts request is the lead time with which the first scheduling is started. So if a production part, which has a master routing over 9 days, is supplemented with a special routing of only one day, only one day is scheduled for this item later in the parts request. This means that the throughput times can be changed in advance using special work plans. Please note: If several BOM items are grouped together for the same part in the parts request, and a special routing has been stored for only one of them, this special routing is used for all BOM items (because of the only parts request item that is created from all identical parts!). 
Sure, I'd be happy to assist! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. Can I explore the explosion of a particular component in the production parts list?
2. How do I update the quantity of a single component in the production parts list without affecting the rest of the components?
3. What happens when I exchange one part for another in the production parts list? Does it affect the overall Bill of Materials (BOM)?
4. Is it possible to create a customized production parts list for a specific order?
5. How can I track changes made to the production parts list for a particular order?
6. What is the purpose of the "Display number of entries (production bill of material/master bill of material)" option in the view options?
7. Can I store special routings for each item in the exploded production parts list?
8. How does the system handle differences between the exploded production parts list and the master parts list?
9. Can I schedule production orders based on the special routings stored for each item in the exploded production parts list?
10. Are there any limitations on the number of special routings that can be stored for each item in the exploded production parts list?

I hope these questions cover most aspects of the module description!

This is the description of the functionality of the module "resolbom" with the name "Exploded (production) parts list" regarding One-time work schedule: If a routing is to be defined at the time the production bill of materials is created, a one-off routing can be created at each exploded production bill of materials item. This is a master routing that is only valid for this order and cannot be found later via the normal master search. In order to get an overview of all routings / one-off routings for a production bill of materials, it is possible to display the routings in the tree. A toolbar button with the routing symbol above the tree is provided for this purpose. If a one-off routing is to be extended or even created, it is sufficient to drag the workstation from the resource list to the higher-level bill of materials item with the mouse. If a master special task list was already connected to this bill of material, this connection is released and a one-time task list is created after a query. In this case the one-time task list does not open at all but only its first position with the work centre dragged into the tree. Here it only needs to be filled in and saved and then it also appears in the tree of the production parts list. By double-clicking, one-time task list items can be opened and edited directly. In order to avoid accidentally changing a global master routing, this function is only allowed for one-time routing items. This is the description of the functionality of the module "resolbom" with the name "Exploded (production) parts list" regarding Structural assembly: A component consists of several sub-assemblies to be assembled. In the exploded parts list you can see the subassemblies to be installed under the main part. However, the production department itself would like to save the sub-steps for the assembly and scheduling of subassemblies and assemble them directly only when the main part is assembled. For these cases, the subassemblies are marked in the parts list as constructive assemblies, i.e. the design department sees these parts as subassemblies, but in the production department the subassemblies of the constructive assemblies are all assembled together without the constructive assemblies. The production department sees this parts list as shown in figure 3 The subparts of a constructive assembly located in the exploded production bill of materials are moved up one level in the production order as if the constructive assembly were not even present in the exploded bill of materials and all subparts of the constructive assembly are moved directly to the position where the constructive assembly itself is located. Figure 1: Figure 2: Figure 3: The parts Test4 and Test5 therefore move below the top level, the constructive assembly is not considered further. In this example, all parts are required on manufacturing level 1. This is the description of the functionality of the module "resolbom" with the name "Exploded (production) parts list" regarding Disposable assembly: In the case of the disposable assemblies, one must distinguish between 2 different scenarios: If a bill of material is linked in a production role and an entry exists in the MRP product structure, the specified part is "pushed" on the entry of the MRP product structure below the production part when the production bill of material is exploded. All parts which are specified in the bill of material item list on the purely MRP assembly are therefore moved from the higher-level bill of material below the new entry. To create a purely MRP assembly, the system starts from the production role to be inserted in between, creates a purely MRP entry there and selects the bill of material with its items from the higher-level bill of material. This purely dispositive entry is then visible both in the initial production roll and in the production roll of the intermediate part. Attention! A purely disposable assembly is not visible in the normal production parts list display: In the dispositive manufacturing structure, the purely dispositive assembly "Test3" appears in the end. For this part a part request item is also created. The parts cx0005 and cx0006 are then arranged below it. An MRP assembly defined by the master is a production part that does not have its own bill of material and contains entries from other, higher-level bills of material in another production part in the "MRP product structure" list. (See here for technical pattern) A condition can only be entered for entries in the MRP product structure if the assembly is a purely MRP assembly. Further information on assembly parts lists and on purely disposable assemblies. 
Sure, I'd be happy to assist! Based on the given module description, here are some potential questions that an unfamiliar user might ask:

1. Can we create one-time routings for multiple production orders simultaneously using the "Exploded (production) parts list" module?
2. How do we extend or create one-off routings for a particular production order using the "exploded parts list"?
3. What happens to the one-time task list items when we edit or change the one-off routing in the "exploded parts list"?
4. Is it possible to view all one-time routings and tasks associated with a particular production order in the "exploded parts list"?
5. Can we filter the displayed routings and tasks based on specific criteria such as due date, priority, etc., within the "exploded parts list"?
6. Are there any restrictions or limitations on creating one-time routings and tasks within the "exploded parts list"?
7. How does the "exploded parts list" module handle changes made to the original master routing during the creation of one-time routings?
8. Does the "exploded parts list" module allow us to create separate routings for different levels of assemblies within the production order?
9. Can we associate specific resources or workstations with individual components or sub-assemblies within the "exploded parts list"?
10. How does the "exploded parts list" module integrate with other modules within SAP, such as Material Resource Planning (MRP), Capacity Management, and Quality Control?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "resolbom" with the name "Exploded (production) parts list" regarding Change of already processed parts lists: An important point here is that the directly superior production order items must be reprinted after a bill of material item has been added or deleted. For this purpose there is a date on the production order item after the change and on the header, which is supposed to say that the already printed production papers have to be collected and reprinted/distributed. This date can be seen in the production order processing mask and in the worklist in the 2nd column. It disappears again after "real" printing of the production documents. Adding parts list items If a parts request for a parts list has already been created and further processed, the corresponding parts list entries can no longer be changed. However, new items can be inserted under production order BOM items if the part request is not released. If the part request has already been released, the release must be cancelled. To insert an item in the parts list, mark the parts list item under which a new item is to be inserted. In the context menu, which can be opened by right-clicking on the selected position, the entry "Insert" has to be selected. A security question will appear which must be answered with YES. Now the parts list item can be created and edited in the usual way. All parts that are included in the production bill of materials must be exploded if there is a production bill of materials for the part, even if this item is actually only to be ordered. How the part is to be planned is set later in the part request. If the parts list item is now complete and is to be processed further, the entry "Edit->Straggler->Extend parts request" must be selected in the main menu. A new parts requisition item is created for each newly created parts list item (without merging with existing parts list items!!), which is planned immediately, i.e. the new parts requisition item is given its standard planning type (warehouse reservation/purchase requisition/production order) and the procurement time is determined and saved based on this. Now the item only needs to be scheduled and further processed using graphical scheduling from the parts requisition: After the appropriate steps have been taken, the part request must now be released at the end via the menu "Edit->Further processing->Release part request". Deletion of parts list items If a parts list item is to be deleted, this can also be done from the parts list. However, the following conditions apply: After checking the conditions, the parts list items are deleted, as are the attached parts request items, provided they are not still needed by other parts list items. exception: If a cancelled successor document is already attached to the part request of the BOM item to be deleted, then both the BOM item and the part request item (if no longer required) are cancelled and displayed with a red X in the BOM. This is the description of the functionality of the module "resolbom" with the name "Exploded (production) parts list" regarding Known change scenarios: Here are instructions on what exactly to do if a change is to be made:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "resolbom" with the name "Exploded (production) parts list" regarding Creation of an advance requirement for a part from a parts list: Via the menu "Edit>Preliminary requirements>Create preliminary requirements for part from selected item" a preliminary requirements item for the part can be created for the selected item. All required characteristics from the parts list or the order item are transferred to the advance requirement. Furthermore, the required quantity and the order as predecessor for the advance requirement header are copied. Even if a production part of a bill of material is taken over into a preliminary requirement, which still has subparts that in turn require further characteristics, these are directly taken over into the preliminary requirement item as they were set in the order or the bill of material. If the part for preliminary planning is a production part, the production bill of materials for this item is also copied. This ensures that in the case of processed production parts lists, these changes are also transferred to the advance requirement. This is the description of the functionality of the module "resolbom" with the name "Exploded (production) parts list" regarding Detaching of parts list nodes from the parts list into a preliminary requirement: If the customer requests changes to an order item that has already been processed, it may be necessary to change the main part on the order item. As this would change the exploded bill of material, and production orders have already been created, for example, this change can no longer be carried out. There are now 2 options available: If you open the exploded parts list of the order item, a new menu item "Edit->Preliminary requirements" is available. It contains 2 entries: "Move selected node to advance requirement" and "Move all subitems of selected node to advance requirement". Attention! Constructive assemblies are dissolved! This means that when a constructive assembly is selected and the menu item "Move selected node to preliminary requirement" is chosen, not the constructive assembly itself but only its sub-items, which are not constructive assemblies themselves, are moved to a preliminary requirement. Only one preliminary requirements header is created for a bill of material, which then contains all the sub-items created. It is possible to extend an advance requirement that already exists for this order. To do this, the existing advance requirement must be opened before the BOM items are released. The system then checks whether the order header in the opened preliminary requirement is identical to that from the BOM item to be released. If not, a new preliminary requirement is created.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "resolbom" with the name "Exploded (production) parts list" regarding Input window: In the tree view, the parts list items can be moved freely in the parts list structure as long as they have not yet been further processed. Exceptions are order and stock parts: Sub-items of them cannot be shifted, as they are only in stock or can be ordered with their original parts list. If a part has already been moved once, the original parent position is saved to it. This means that it can also be extracted from parts lists of ordered and stock parts, for example if they have been moved here by mistake. If a part cannot be moved successfully, the reason is displayed on the status bar of the window. This is the description of the functionality of the module "resolbom" with the name "Exploded (production) parts list" regarding Care window: In this window the entries of a production bill of materials are maintained. In particular, it is possible to exchange the part and/or its bill of material, to make entries for the MRP structure and to make quantity adjustments. On the uppermost bill of material node, a check is carried out to ensure that the bill of material quantity matches the quantity of the predecessor order. Attribute maintenance In addition to the 'normal' options for inserting, creating or removing attributes, further functions are available in the maintenance window of the parts list items. Note: In a production bill of materials, the attributes do not refer to the same attributes at a higher level, as is the case in the order. Therefore, it should be avoided to insert attributes that are already defined in the production BOM or the preceding document. Serial numbers Here the serial numbers are displayed, which were used in the parts list items. Especially the serial numbers which were assigned by the supplier have to be entered here, as these parts do not appear in any production order.

This is the description of the module "purchcre" with the name "Incoming credit notes": Since the A/P credit memo entry and processing is very similar to the A/P invoice, you will find a detailed description within the A/P invoice. General: Incoming invoice credit notes are recorded and released in an almost identical way to incoming invoices. Thus, the masks for the entry look almost identical, but are still two different ones. However, the masks can be distinguished by the title and by the picture next to the number. The differences to the invoices: The first difference is, of course, that the values, even if they are shown as positive, are recorded negatively in the financial accounts. In the same way as for incoming invoices, "normal" and "free" items can also be entered for credit notes. The difference, however, is the previous check. Thus, normal items of a credit note can only be entered if the previous order item has the status "partially invoiced" or "invoiced". These "normal" items should be recorded if the credit note is intended to cancel all or part of the invoice or quantity invoiced. If the full invoice quantity is credited, the order item is again in the status "not invoiced". The other case is that a rebate/discount is subsequently credited to the invoiced quantity. In this case a credit note is recorded, but this should not have any effect on the calculation status of the order item. This corresponds to the free item, as is already the case with incoming invoices. The following aspects have an influence on the release of a position. Items that do not meet all controls must be checked manually and then released manually. A position must be checked if the position should be examined independently of any problems. the value deviation is too large. different header conditions on order and credit note were determined. it is a free credit item the total quantity of all credit notes relating to an order item is greater than the quantity invoiced. the total quantity of all credit notes relating to an order item differs from the quantity invoiced. it is a free credit item. Incoming credit notes for complaints Incoming credit notes for complaints can be entered via free positions. The complaint document must be selected as the predecessor here.

This is the description of the module "unittabl" with the name "Table of units": Unit tables define the conversion between different units. In this module unit conversions for parts are given, e.g. "1 bar" corresponds to "6000 mm". Specific weights/weights are also given in these tables of units ("1000 mm" corresponds to "3.25 kg"). The units defined here for a part can then be specified at any point in the entire system for this part. A special feature is the variant part with its sub-parts; if the sub-part does not have its own unit table, that of the variant part is used. Any conversions necessary for calculations are automatically carried out by the system using this unit table. Such calculations also arise whenever different units of measure have to be specified in the logistics account of a part for staging (handling unit), planning (purchasing/production unit) and stock management (stock unit). Different units for sales and order prices (€ per "any" unit) may also have been specified here, which also require conversion. To cover all the complexity of such unit conversions, unit conversions may be specified as a fixed pair of values, as a formula or as a conditional table. The following rules apply to the conversion: Direct Conversion Indirect conversion Remainders when converting Conversion rates. This is the description of the functionality of the module "unittabl" with the name "Table of units" regarding Direct Conversion: Direct conversion uses exactly one exchange rate to convert one unit to another. The list of exchange rates is run through in sequence and the first exchange rate with which conversion is possible is used. If a conversion is to be possible with several conversion rates, i.e. "across other units", indirect conversion should be used. This is the description of the functionality of the module "unittabl" with the name "Table of units" regarding Indirect conversion: In contrast to direct conversion, indirect conversion allows conversion "across several units". If, for example, "15 cans" are to be converted into "pallets", it is not necessary to define a conversion rate between these two units. If there is a conversion rate between "cans" and "boxes" and between "boxes" and "pallets", "cans" can be converted to "pallets" by "diversion" via "boxes". The length of the conversion path is not important. This is the description of the functionality of the module "unittabl" with the name "Table of units" regarding Remainders when converting: In contrast to the conversion of currencies, there is still a fundamental difference, as the source unit cannot always be exactly converted into the target unit. For example, do the following two conversion rates exist: they represent integer ratios, i.e. the conversion of "6 cans" into "boxes" does not result in "1,2 boxes" but in "1 box and 1 can". If the conversion is done indirectly, there can also be several remainders, so that e.g. "22 cans" converted into "pallets" results in "1 pallet" with the remainder "1 crate and 2 cans". Classix provides functionality for the management of such remainders in order to be able to display the remainder as the initial unit again, in this example as "7 cans". This is the description of the functionality of the module "unittabl" with the name "Table of units" regarding Conversion rates: When defining an exchange rate, four types can be distinguished. These are. This is the description of the functionality of the module "unittabl" with the name "Table of units" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain unit tables of parts. This is the description of the functionality of the module "unittabl" with the name "Table of units" regarding Examples: In the system a unit package is defined. Now it may happen that in certain cases the unit needs to be specified more precisely (e.g. "data package" or "Christmas package"). In order not to have to create a completely new unit, data and Christmas packages are both packages, a new designation can be entered in specific cases by means of a unit table. In addition to the designation, you can also enter a quantity (field "Unit2"). This means that a "Christmas package" does not necessarily have to be a synonym for "package", but can also correspond to "1 kg". For a "real" unit only one overdefined unit can exist. For example, if you define "data packet" first, then "Christmas packet" in a table of units and register this table, only "Christmas packet" (as a unit defined later) is a valid unit. This functionality of redefining units is not fully implemented. For example, in a ListBox, the redefined name is only displayed the first time it is displayed. In addition, the unit names defined in this way are monolingual because this window stores the unit name in the "uniqueID" field of the newly created CX_UNIT-RATE object. See also ChangeUnitNames.

I hope these questions provide useful insights into the functionality of the Table of Units module!

This is the description of the functionality of the module "unittabl" with the name "Table of units" regarding Conditional unit conversion: The conditional table is useful for variant parts if there must be a conversion that is dependent on a material characteristic. For example, for sheet metal. Sheets are calculated per kilogram in the order and ordered per piece. For these variant parts, the surface dimensions and material thicknesses can be freely set on the order. The different material thicknesses now result in different conversions from dm² to kg. These conversions can be entered in the conditional unit conversion. Example: Example 2 To get from one piece to the weight of the material (depending on dimensions and material), the unit conversion can be even more dynamic: Conversion 1: area in units Type: Formula Value: ValuePer(LENGTH_BROAD_PART*WIDTH_BROAD_PART, 1 piece) Result: dm²/piece Conversion 2: Material thickness in weight Type: Formula value: 7.85 [[kg/l]*STAERKE_ROHTEIL Result: kg/dm² If the attributes LENGTH_BROAD_PART, WIDTH_BROAD_PART and STRENGTH_BROAD_PART are now set in the order at a position with a piece of this sheet, the weight per piece can be determined. To make the calculation also dependent on the material type (different density), the type "table" is to be preferred for conversion 2: Type: Table Content: Result: kg/dm² Note that the l in the formula [[kg/l] is a small L and stands for litre, thus replacing dm*dm*dm or also dm³. This is simply clearer in the formula and has the advantage that the system does not search for another conversion from kilogram to dm and possibly end up in an endless loop.

This is the description of the module "mt940edt" with the name "Editing bank statements": This module allows to import account statements, which are provided by banks in the context of online banking as files (*.STA) in MT940 format, into ClassiX® and to transfer them to the financial accounting. On the basis of the imported data, the module automatically determines the appropriate account assignment, e.g. by searching for invoice, customer or other numbers or specific usage texts. This initial account assignment can also be carried out or maintained manually by the user. Since banks usually transmit the data from different accounts in only one file, options can be used to set whether the statement data of accounts (and/or banks) not defined in the system should simply be read over. It can also be specified in the data of current accounts stored in the system whether these should not be read in. If data from a file has not been read in, a corresponding warning message is issued. If individual (or all) postings on a bank statement have been automatically pre-assigned or post-processed, these (or the bank statement as a whole) can be transferred to financial accounting. This is the description of the functionality of the module "mt940edt" with the name "Editing bank statements" regarding List window: In this window, the account statements are read in, listed and processed for transfer to the financial accounting. The upper part of the window (bank statements) contains the list of all the bank statements found in the file. Each sheet of an account statement is listed in a separate line. Right-clicking on any entry in the upper list opens a context menu for editing. If one of these listed bank statements is selected, the postings imported from this bank statement are displayed in the lower part of the window (postings). Accounts can be assigned to the individual postings by using the right mouse button or by double-clicking on them to branch to the maintenance of this data(transaction window). When importing, the system automatically tries to assign the transmitting bank, including the business account concerned and its corresponding financial account, to the bank statement and to assign the individual postings to an account. Right-clicking on any entry in the lower list opens the context menu for editing. The data fields read from the file are shown in blue in the lists, the data fields assigned from the database are shown in green (cyan). This is the description of the functionality of the module "mt940edt" with the name "Editing bank statements" regarding Transaction window: In this window, you can maintain the data of each transaction of a bank statement. The fields marked in grey are only displayed and cannot be edited. This is the description of the functionality of the module "mt940edt" with the name "Editing bank statements" regarding Option window: In this window, you can specify options for processing a bank statement. This is the description of the functionality of the module "mt940edt" with the name "Editing bank statements" regarding Transfer to financial accounting: If a selected account statement is posted, several financial accounting documents - each separated by posting period - may well be created. These can then be further processed in the booking module from the list of unbooked documents. If a bank statement contains entries without value, these are not transferred to the accounting system. Bank statements entered in the financial accounting system cannot be subsequently changed. Many context-sensitive functions, such as finding partners, are also deactivated.

This is the description of the module "corporateGroupEdit" with the name "Affiliated companies": This app can be used to maintain the relationships of affiliated companies. For this purpose, it is possible to specify for companies which other company is the parent or parent company or which other companies are subordinates or subsidiaries. This information is used, for example, in the account assignment of outgoing or incoming invoices. The term 'associated enterprises' should not be confused with the term 'branch'. Enterprises are affiliated if they are independent companies that cooperate with each other through participations. Branches are locations/departments of one and the same company. Branches are maintained in the company master module.

This is the description of the module "paymprop" with the name "Payments - Financial accounting book": With this module, creditor payments to suppliers, employees, commission recipients or customers are selected from financial accounting and instructed to make payment. First, either by an automatic run or a manual selection , a payment proposal list is built up whose open items can be post-processed in the dialogue. For individual or several open items, the payment to be made can be edited, i.e. the discount amount as well as the payment amount (also as a partial amount) can be specified. The open items marked in the payment proposal list are then released for bank clearing (supported formats SEPA, DTAUS, MT101, DTAZV) or cheque printing, whereby the posting of the payment and the clearing takes place automatically in the financial accounting. The open items can be selected in several consecutive steps in order to pay by different payment methods (see also Conditional selection). Possible cash discount income is automatically determined and posted against the cash discount accounts defined in the tax keys. In the case of incoming invoices for fixed assets, any cash discount income is posted against the fixed asset account posted with the incoming invoice. This is the description of the functionality of the module "paymprop" with the name "Payments - Financial accounting book" regarding Automatic selection of payment proposals: You can create a payment proposal list using the selection criteria available here. Payments to employees, for example for travel expense accounts, or to commission recipients or customers can also be made from here. You can also open the window for selecting individual open items via the menu or toolbar. This is the description of the functionality of the module "paymprop" with the name "Payments - Financial accounting book" regarding Payment proposal list: You can add other surgeries to the list at any time: Selected payment proposals can be individually post-edited by double-clicking. This and the storage of fixed or partial payment amounts can also be accessed via the context menu (right mouse button in the payment proposal list). After the payment proposal list has been completely processed, the payments are posted via the menu item 'Payment', under the respective payment type, with 'Book'. You must select the payment proposals - which you want to release for posting/payment (see the menu item Select). In this way, you can choose different payment types or bank accounts for the payment proposals selected. The payment proposals then processed are then automatically removed from the list. If you want to process all payments via one bank or payment type, you can of course also select all payment proposals at once. Please remember that an interim account should also be set up for the selected bank. If the bank data medium is to be created at the same time, the path must be specified in the 'File' field. Please make sure that you have access rights to the path you have entered. By clicking on the button 'Post' the processing of the payment run is started and completed with the printing of the data carrier accompanying sheet at the bank clearing. Cheque printing is done in the same way as bank clearing. To ensure that the forms are correctly clamped in the printer, a test print can first be made there. The paid OPs are automatically cleared only after the bank data medium has been successfully created or after the cheques have been printed. Until then, the invoices remain in the open item account with their assigned payments. A possible cause for errors can be a missing bank connection in the person master data. If this is the case, enter the details accordingly and then repeat the bank clearing or cheque printing process. Bank clearing and cheque printing can be called up as often as required. The payment selection for employees, commission recipients or customers is done in the same way. This is the description of the functionality of the module "paymprop" with the name "Payments - Financial accounting book" regarding Conditional selection: This window is accessed from the payment proposal list and is used to automatically select the open items displayed in the payment proposal list according to various criteria. This may be necessary, for example, if you want to pay via Bank Clearing firstly only domestic or European suppliers (in data exchange format SEPA or DTAUS) and secondly only foreign suppliers (in data exchange format MT101 or DTAZV). This is the description of the functionality of the module "paymprop" with the name "Payments - Financial accounting book" regarding Selecting individual open items: Particularly in the case of manually posted incoming invoices, it can make sense to manually call up individual incoming invoices to be paid. This is the description of the functionality of the module "paymprop" with the name "Payments - Financial accounting book" regarding Edit payment: If the payment amount is to be specified manually for individual or several open items, these specifications can be made here.

This is the description of the module "olsync" with the name "English:Outlook Synchronisation": With this module the contacts in a folder of Outlook can be synchronised with any contacts in ClassiX®. The basic procedure is the following: First a connection between a contact in Outlook and a contact in ClassiX® must be established. Then the contact data (business address, private address, ) is assigned to the desired fields in Outlook. This assignment can be made individually for each contact and will be used later for all synchronisation processes. As soon as there is a connection between the contacts, they can be synchronised at any time. This is the description of the functionality of the module "olsync" with the name "English:Outlook Synchronisation" regarding Main window: The entire synchronisation is controlled and also started from this window. The most important part of the window is the list in which all contacts to be synchronised are displayed. Above this, it is shown which folder is currently selected in Outlook. Here, the default Outlook contact folder is selected by default. The button "Select" opens a dialogue with which a contact folder of Outlook can be selected. The small button next to it is used to update the list if something has changed in the Outlook folder. After selecting an Outlook folder, all contacts contained in it are loaded into the list. A symbol in front of each entry indicates what will happen in case of synchronisation with this contact. The table below provides an overview of the possible states. In principle, there are four different states. Firstly: a contact exists in ClassiX® as well as in Outlook and has already been connected. Then the contact data is simply written to ClassiX® or Outlook depending on the setting (see Options). Second: If a contact from the current Outlook folder has not yet been connected or does not exist in ClassiX® at all, then this contact has to be connected (if necessary a new person has to be created, see Connections). Thirdly: If a contact from ClassiX® is added to the list, the module assumes that it does not exist in the selected Outlook folder. During synchronisation a new contact is then automatically created and connected in Outlook (but the contact data must be connected manually, see Connections). Fourthly, a conflict has arisen in the determination of the status. This is for example the case if a contact from ClassiX® has been added to the list, which is already connected to an Outlook contact from another folder. This contact can then be reconnected by closing the old connection. This results in the following boundary condition for the synchronisation: Only folders can be synchronised. To start a synchronisation process, no contact may have the state "Conflict" or "Not available in ClassiX®". The assignment between Outlook contacts and ClassiX® contacts is user-dependent. This means that each ClassiX® user can define his own assignments, which are then saved. Since the contact data in ClassiX® are not user specific, conflicts may occur. For example, two different users could connect the same contact from ClassiX® with another contact from Outlook. If one of the users synchronises, the ClassiX® contact might contain data that the other user did not want to synchronise. This is the description of the functionality of the module "olsync" with the name "English:Outlook Synchronisation" regarding Connection window: In this window you can assign an Outlook contact to a ClassiX® contact, select the contact data (telephone numbers, addresses) to be synchronised and assign them to the fields of the Outlook contact. The ClassiX® contact and its data (name, first name ) are displayed on the left side of the window. Below this is a list containing all contact data found in ClassiX®. If nothing is shown on the left, it is a contact that exists in Outlook but has not yet been connected to ClassiX®. In this case the corresponding information is displayed as soon as a connection has been established. On the right side you can see all fields from Outlook that are synchronised. By Drag&Drop the individual contact data can now be dragged into the fields and thus be assigned. The exact assignment is left to each user, e.g. it is also possible to assign fax numbers to the telephone fields. The type is only checked for the addresses. If a contact information does not yet exist in ClassiX®, a button with which it can be newly created for the assigned ClassiX® contact. If a field is already connected, a button which can be used to undo the assignment. Connecting to a ClassiX® contact is also done by drag & drop. Any contact object can be dragged to the left side to establish a connection. You can also use the button "Select person" or "Select company" to select a corresponding contact object. If you want to create a new contact in ClassiX®, you can do so by using the buttons "Create person" or "Create company". Then a new contact object will be created and connected. With the button "Disconnect" (in the toolbar or on the top right of the Outlook contact) the connection between ClassiX® and Outlook is disconnected again. The button "Cancel individual assignments" cancels all assignments of the Outlook fields. This happens automatically when the person assignment is disconnected. With the button "Automatically assign Outlook fields" all fields can be automatically connected with the corresponding contact data from ClassiX®. All changes to the contact or field assignments are only accepted after clicking on "OK" and can also be cancelled with the "Cancel" button. 
Sure! Based on the given module description, here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask:

1. How do I begin synchronizing my Outlook contacts with ClassiX?
2. Can I choose which particular Outlook folder I wish to sync with ClassiX?

8. Does the module allow me to alter preexisting associations between Outlook contacts and ClassiX contacts?
9. Are there any constraints on the types of data that can be synced between Outlook and ClassiX?
10. Can I view a summary of the synchronization process and its outcomes within the main window?

I hope these queries are useful! Remember to always refer to the module name ("olsync") when asking questions related to its features and functionalities.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "olsync" with the name "English:Outlook Synchronisation" regarding Option window: Some settings for the synchronisation process can be made here. The first option is the master selection, which determines from where to where the contact data is written. If "ClassiX" is selected here, all contact data is always written from ClassiX® to Outlook. If "Outlook" is selected, it is the other way round. If the option "By date" is selected, the date of the last change on the respective page is compared with the date of the other page and the older contact is overwritten with the information from the newer one. Below this you will find the display options. If "Current folder" is selected here, only contacts from the current Outlook folder are displayed. However, if "All Folders" is selected, all contacts connected to Outlook from any Outlook folder are displayed. The check box indicates whether contacts marked as "Private" in Outlook should also be displayed. Only then these contacts can be connected and synchronised with ClassiX® contacts. Otherwise the private contacts from Outlook are completely ignored. Already connected contacts are always displayed, regardless of whether they are marked as "Private" or not. In order to remove these contacts from display, the connection must first be disconnected in ClassiX®. The last option on the left side is to define which information should be transferred from Outlook to ClassiX®. So it might not be desirable to change the data of the respective company for each Outlook contact in ClassiX®. Just activate the checkbox for the information that should be transferred. In the upper right corner you can control the behaviour when automatically connecting an Outlook contact with a ClassiX® contact. The first option controls the basic procedure, whether to try to find an already existing contact in ClassiX® or whether to create a new contact in general. The second option applies in case no contact was found during the search. In this case one can be created automatically or nothing can be done, so that a manual assignment is possible or necessary. The last option on the right side controls what should happen when a company from ClassiX® is added. Either only the company can be selected, only the employees of the company or both. The options are saved user-specifically so that each user can configure Outlook synchronization according to their preferences.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bpsalesbilling" with the name "Business processes - Sales - Billing" regarding Definition: Invoicing (from Latin-Spanish factura for invoice) is a process in accounting where an invoice is issued to a customer for goods and/or services that have been delivered and/or provided (in rare cases, foreseen). Invoicing also involves posting the business case to appropriate accounts. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bpsalesbilling" with the name "Business processes - Sales - Billing" regarding Process: The invoicing process begins with the entry of the order. When creating the order items, a rule is used to determine which items are given the billing status. Only items that have this status can be billed. So if a sales set has the billing status but not the lower parts, only the sales set can be included in an invoice. A single sub-item can therefore neither be invoiced nor credited. There are two ways to create the invoice. Firstly, the quick delivery/invoicing module can be called up from the order. Various options can be used here to control how an invoice is to be created. However, it is always the case that all order items that have not yet been invoiced are included in the invoice. Another way is to create the invoice manually. This way, individual order items can be transferred to the invoice via the invoice module. Invoice items always have an order item as predecessor. It is also possible to generate an invoice from a delivery note (e.g. via the quick invoicing module). This is useful, for example, if partial deliveries are to be invoiced individually. In this case the invoice item has the delivery note item as predecessor and this in turn has the order item. The registration is the end of the registration of the invoice. At this point, the invoice is pre-assigned and frozen. If the invoice cannot be assigned to an account, either the account assignment rules must be adjusted or manual account assignment must be carried out. Invoices which have the status "registered" can be transferred to the financial accounting via the outgoing invoice book. The commercial part of the invoicing process is now complete, unless the invoiced goods need to be credited. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bpsalesbilling" with the name "Business processes - Sales - Billing" regarding Status: The order items and the order header also have a billing status, which is determined via the invoiced quantity. Therefore, if an order item of three pieces has an invoice item of also three pieces of at least one registered invoice as successor, the order item is also considered to be invoiced. If this is not the case, it assumes the status "not billed" or "partially billed". An order is considered as invoiced when all its items, which have the billing status, have been invoiced. However, there are exceptions to this, as there are three types of invoices. Up to now, the type "Itemised (normal)" has always been assumed, which causes the behaviour mentioned. In contrast, invoices of the type "Itemised (flat rate)" have no effect on the order status. This type is used, for example, if additional costs are to be invoiced for an item, but the normal invoicing of the item still follows. The same applies to credit memos if the credit memo for an item should not result in the order item having to be re-invoiced. A third type is the invoice type "order-related". Here no order item is shown in the invoice but only the order header itself. This case is used for additional costs which cannot be assigned to an item or also for flat-rate credit notes. An invoice which results in the order changing to the status "Invoiced" automatically receives the Final invoice indicator. However, this indicator can also be set manually. This indicator is important for the order cost evaluation in order to be able to determine the closing period of an order.

This is the description of the module "outlook" with the name "English:Outlook": With the Outlook module, contacts from MS Outlook® can be synchronised with persons, contact persons and employees from the CyberEnterprise® PS database. Two different modes of use are available for this purpose: import and export mode. Which mode to use depends on the system (in MS Outlook® or in the CyberEnterprise® PS database) in which a contact is first created or already existed. If many contacts already exist in MS Outlook® or if the contacts are first created in MS Outlook®, then the import mode should be used. In this case, the contacts from MS Outlook® must be manually assigned to the corresponding objects in the CyberEnterprise® PS database via Connect, as contacts in MS Outlook® are not managed clearly separated according to (private) persons, contact persons or employees. If contact data is first created in the CyberEnterprise® PS database, it can be transferred to MS Outlook® using the export mode. This is the description of the functionality of the module "outlook" with the name "English:Outlook" regarding General: The arrangement of the areas in the editing windows is basically divided into two, i.e. independent of whether you are in import or export mode. On the one hand, there is a list of contacts to be edited in the left area of the window, and a preview area in the right area of the window, where the relevant personal data for the individual fields are displayed in MS Outlook®. This is the description of the functionality of the module "outlook" with the name "English:Outlook" regarding Import MS Outlook contacts into the CyberEnterprise PS database: The import mode is used to connect contacts from MS Outlook® with the objects already existing in the CyberEnterprise® PS database. In the list in the left part of the window, the contacts existing in the currently selected folder of MS Outlook® are displayed. A contact can be selected with the corresponding button and is also shown below. The two buttons 'Import Selected' and 'Import All' are equivalent to the buttons in the export mode, only this one is imported from MS Outlook®. When importing into the CyberEnterprise® PS database, please note that a contact from MS Outlook®, which was not created by exporting from the CyberEnterprise® PS database, must first be connected to its counterpart in the CyberEnterprise® PS database. For this purpose, the context menu contains the option'Connect' in addition to the items 'Remove' and 'Import'. This is only available if a connection is actually necessary, i.e. the objects from MS Outlook® and the CyberEnterprise® PS database have not already been connected previously. This is indicated by the small symbol next to each list entry. If the symbol for an employee, the symbol for a contact person or the symbol for a person, then it could already be automatically determined which contact from the CyberEnterprise® PS database belongs to this MS Outlook® contact. However, if the symbol is displayed, this connection must be established manually. When the import is started, the information about this contact is updated in the CyberEnterprise® PS database. Again, it is possible to make short-term changes in the preview area. If an attempt is made to import an unlinked contact, the Connect window is automatically displayed. After clicking 'OK' the selected person will be imported immediately. The Connect window is also displayed if a not yet linked contact is found after clicking on 'Import all'. If a contact is connected, the editing window of the selected object of the CyberEnterprise® PS database can be opened by double-clicking from the list of contacts. This is the description of the functionality of the module "outlook" with the name "English:Outlook" regarding Connect: To manually link an MS Outlook® contact to an object in the CyberEnterprise® PS database, the menu selection 'Connect' creates this input window, containing the most basic information about the contact from MS Outlook®. Now you can drag and drop the desired object from the CyberEnterprise®PS database into the lower part of the window. After a click on 'OK' the connection is established. This is the description of the functionality of the module "outlook" with the name "English:Outlook" regarding Export CyberEnterprise PS database objects to MS Outlook: The export mode is used to export personal, own employee or external contact data as a contact to MS Outlook®. In order to export contacts from the CyberEnterprise® PS database to MS Outlook®, they can be dragged and dropped into the list from anywhere. If you select a person, you can see in the preview area which information will be exported to MS Outlook®. Changes can be made here before the export. The small icon for each contact in the list shows whether or not it has already been exported to MS Outlook®. The symbol for an employee, the symbol for a contact person or the symbol for a person means that the export has already taken place and the symbol that this contact has not yet been exported. If a contact already exists in MS Outlook®, the associated information is only updated, otherwise a new contact is created. With the right mouse button a context menu can be displayed in the list (see below for explanation), with a double click the selected object can be edited. At the bottom edge of the window it is shown in which folder in MS Outlook® the contacts are saved. By default, the default folder of MS Outlook® is always entered here for contact data. For export you can either use the button 'Export all' to export all persons in the list to MS Outlook®. With 'Export selected' only the currently selected contacts are exported. Multiple selection is possible in the list. If a contact is connected, the editing window of the selected object of the CyberEnterprise® PS database can be opened by double-clicking from the list of contacts.

This is the description of the module "partnerCastEdit" with the name "Partners and roles": This app is used to create and delete partner-role relationships. Several roles can be assigned to each partner, e.g. a company and/or a person can have the role "customer" and also the role "operator" (of an industrial plant). Also, a person can be, for example, "employee" and also "user" (of the IT system) or a company can be "supplier" and also "manufacturer", etc."Partners" in CyberEnterprise® are therefore only companies (legal entities) or persons (natural persons), these central entities are assigned e.g. addresses, bank details, private details, etc., i.e. information that is independent of the type of business relationship. The actual way in which these partners relate to you in a business relationship is defined by their role.Both companies and persons can have one or more roles. This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerCastEdit" with the name "Partners and roles" regarding Input window: If the window is opened via a (partner) role, the second window is automatically completed. Something similar happens when opening via the partner, except that the "Role -> Partner" window is only filled if the partner has only one role. If this is not the case, it is hidden. By selecting a role, you can then access the "Role -> Partner" window via the theatre mask. This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerCastEdit" with the name "Partners and roles" regarding Assign roles: If a company is already created in the partner administration, for example as a "supplier", and now also becomes a "customer", then you can simply add a new role to the already existing entry. To do this, select the entry in the company list and click on the role icon. Next, click on 'Create', select the additional role of the partner and add it to the existing entry with 'Select'. This automatically opens (in this example) the input mask for the customer data. Most of the data has already been taken over from the supplier entry. You can now add or change the customer-specific data in this mask. If the customer number is not assigned automatically via the register, you should assign and enter it. Then close the mask with 'OK' to save your entries. Now two roles are assigned to the company entry. If you do not see them immediately, close the mask once and open it again to display the updated list. You can edit the customer or supplier data by double-clicking on the respective role. If, for example, you have assigned the role "Employee" (of your own company) to a person and this person is also the contact person (possibly as a side job) of another company, then these are roles of the same type "Contact": "Contact person of your own company, but also of the external company. In some masks, information about a person is filled with contact data, so it can happen that you want to influence which contact should be output there, which contact is the more important one. Since the first contact found is always output, you can also change the order of the roles with the buttons next to the list. This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerCastEdit" with the name "Partners and roles" regarding Organise roles: The occurrence of duplicates cannot always be avoided. Especially if the company entries in the partner administration are maintained by different departments and/or employees. Even if you have taken over supplier and customer lists from another system when setting up your CyberEnterprise® , redundancies will probably have been carried along. However, you can organise these redundancies subsequently at any time and thus eliminate them. In the classic case there are creditors with debit balances, in other words suppliers who are also managed as customers. However, it is also conceivable that banks or even the tax office are also customers of your company. You can easily resolve duplicate entries and organise them correctly. First decide which existing entry you want to assign the additional role to and mark it in the company list. Banks and tax offices are a special case here: If you want to assign an additional role to them, you must select the entry that is not already assigned the role 'Bank' or 'Tax office'. Next, click on the role icon. Now you have opened the role window for the supplier entry in the example shown. Mark the role 'Supplier' and click on the icon 'Change partner'. Now arrange the two windows in such a way that you can click on the customer entry and drag and drop it into the role window. The role 'supplier', which was previously assigned to the entry with '.GmbH' in the example, is now added to the entry with '.company'. Confirm this action with 'OK' and close the role window again. The company entry '.company' now has both roles, customer and supplier, assigned as properties. The entry '.GmbH' has no role assigned and can be deleted.

The document can be linked to an order item, a part request item or a bill of material item. All controlling business process possibilities of the following further processing are indicated on the document. On the basis of the customer complaints created over a period of time, statistics can be created via the evaluation "customer complaint statistics", which under certain circumstances can reveal a generally necessary recall of frequently complained parts. This is the description of the functionality of the module "saretour" with the name "Complaint" regarding Input window: The predecessor of a customer complaint can be order items, order headers, parts list items or parts request items. These must be dragged into the predecessor field with the mouse and saved with the OK button. If the complaint was created directly from an order item/parts list, the predecessor is already entered. The following disposition of the replacement goods is always done by an internal order, which is attached to the complaint as a successor. It determines the new disposition of the goods to be carried out (production order, purchase order, stock withdrawal). The delivery note is also subsequently generated when the customer receives an exchange. The status of the complaint document is then also switched to "delivered". The received goods complained about by the customer can now be returned to the supplier, stored, repaired or scrapped. The corresponding toolbar buttons are located on the position processing mask. If the goods are to be scrapped, simply tick the appropriate box on the mask. After posting the goods receipt, the document status then changes to "scrapped", no further posting is required.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_outprovisio" with the name "Own supplies - processes" regarding Description: In order to illustrate what a self-supply is, please refer to the following diagram: {img type="fileId" fileId="201" thumb="box" width="100%"} The company "Monti" needs 20 motors and 20 control units each to supply 20 pumps to the company "Pumpe". These 20 motors and 20 control units will be provided to "Monti" by the ordering company "Pumpe" "own". A self-supply item is usually in the status "Waiting demand" after creation. Waiting demand means that a quantity of a part is to be provided which has not yet arrived in the full quantity required for provision. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_outprovisio" with the name "Own supplies - processes" regarding The 2 fundamentally different types of provision:: Supplies may be required by different departments: Furthermore, there is a distinction as to whether it is a matter of provision or external production. In the case of external production, the supplier is sent the complete bill of materials for the part, whereby he only has to do the final work and does not contribute any parts himself. See extended workbench. We manufacture a part of the entire work plan ourselves, the external supplier has practically only one job to do, i.e. we receive a production order ourselves, which we have to process ourselves up to or from the external work sequence. With the typical provision, the supplier only gets a few parts of the bill of materials - the rest is provided by the supplier. The supplier does all the work himself, we have nothing to do with production and do not even receive a production order with this provision. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_outprovisio" with the name "Own supplies - processes" regarding Manual provision creation without master information: Attention! In addition to the method listed below (standard method), there is also the following: Insert an assembly set into the sales order, the part of which is a purchased part with own provision per logistics indicator. Below the assembly set in the order, free order items are now created for the parts that are provided. During the technical release, a parts request is created and the provisions and requirement requests are automatically generated! . The standard procedure is explained here using the example of the motors in the above diagram: The staging type in the item for internal provision controls how the internal provision document is to be staged for incoming goods. However, it is always processed further using the staging status list. It is also possible to provide a self-supply document via this document itself by setting the traffic light to green in the item processing mask. The system checks whether sufficient goods have arrived and if so, the document is marked as provided. The following steps are necessary in order to provide a supplier with parts that he himself needs to manufacture the ordered part:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_outprovisio" with the name "Own supplies - processes" regarding Customer order (level 0): The part to be provided is a. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_outprovisio" with the name "Own supplies - processes" regarding Production order (level > 0): The part to be provided is a. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_outprovisio" with the name "Own supplies - processes" regarding Automatic provision creation with master information: See also master documentation for assembly sets! There are order parts for which certain parts must always be made available (provided) to the supplier when the order is placed. These parts can be specified in the master information in so-called BOMs of material provided at the supplier. In the case of purchased parts with own provision, this is a mixed form of production part and order part, because MRP and work preparation can/must be integrated into the procurement process, since some parts may be provided that must first be produced or ordered themselves. In order to set up this type of parts and to be able to plan them successfully, the following steps are necessary: Customise master information Disposition process If a part, which is defined as a purchased part with internal provision by logistics indicator, has to be produced by the customer in a sales order, this can be marked on the exploded BOM item of the purchased part with internal provision (see description "exploded BOM item"). By setting the indicator, when the BOM item is subsequently exploded, the production BOM is exploded instead of the supplier BOM. A production order with all items contained in the exploded production BOM is then also created in the parts requisition for the order part with own provision.

Per PDC document (YYY) the target set-up time is added to the target time of the work sequence. The column"Actual hours(completed)" only shows the actual times of completedwork sequences. The column"Actual hours(completed - not delimited)" shows all actual times of completedwork sequences, the previous evaluation periods are taken into account. The column"Target hours(completed - not delimited)" shows all target times of completedwork sequences, the previous evaluation periods are taken into account. This"Actual hours(finished - not delimited)" value is compared with the column"Target hours(finished - not delimited)", the sum of the target times of completedwork sequences. This results in the percentage deviation which is displayed in the list. The target hours are always assigned to the first reported actual resource in order to obtain a pure comparison of the target/actual times and not an evaluation of changes of the target to actual resources. The column"Target hours(finished - not delimited)" can therefore even be empty, for example, if several confirmations come from different actual resources for a single work sequence. The target hours for the 2nd and all other resources are no longer assigned to them. The percentage deviation between target and actual hours (not delimited) is displayed in the column "Deviation". In the last two columns the valuation of the reported hours is shown with the costs of the respective actual work centre. "Is time confirmation on target quantity" means that a PDA recording is recorded with a confirmed time on a work sequence that was originally created in pieces. This can occur with external work sequences, as the external work sequences do not have target times but target quantities. If an ACTUAL time is now logged off here, this message is issued. 2. list type cost object The confirmed production hours are displayed cumulatively according to cost object, actual cost centre and actual resource. A valuation is carried out according to the cost rates of the actual resource. If the option Subtotal is activated, totals are output per cost object.

This is the description of the module "delinote" with the name "Delivery note": In this module, delivery notes can be recorded and further processed.Instructions for printing delivery notes can be found here. This is the description of the functionality of the module "delinote" with the name "Delivery note" regarding Creation of delivery notes: Delivery notes can be created for order items, incoming goods, stock removal and stock orders. To create a delivery note for one of these predecessors, open a new delivery note, save it, switch to the "Items" tab and drag the predecessors into the list. A delivery note item is immediately created for all predecessors. Here the part and the quantity are automatically taken over. It is also possible to create a free delivery note item. To do this, press the "Create" button in the "Positions" tab and select the menu item "Delivery note position". Now you have the possibility to create all data freely, like quantity, part and predecessor. All the above-mentioned previous documents can now be dragged back into the previous field. If no quantity has been entered or no part has been selected, the data of the predecessor are taken over. If data has already been entered, it will not be overwritten. Control of recipient / conditions: A delivery note can only be (automatically) extended if the recipient set in the delivery note header matches that of the order. Please note that order groups can also have a different recipient. If the latter is the case, the group can only be drawn into a delivery note individually. In order to prevent errors/discrepancies, the delivery notes are not automatically divided in the above case. Since the delivery conditions can also differ on the order groups, the same rule applies here as for the recipient. Each delivery condition can only be used once per delivery note, otherwise an error is reported. If an order group has a condition that has not yet been used in the delivery note header, this condition is copied into the delivery note. This is the description of the functionality of the module "delinote" with the name "Delivery note" regarding Types of delivery notes: There are basically 2 different types of delivery notes: The head type depends on the delivery note item types. So if a delivery note only consists of service items, the delivery note becomes the delivery confirmation. If there is a part in between, it remains an ordinary delivery note. A delivery confirmation assumes other conditions than a delivery note. The delivery confirmation first enters the status "In Acceptance" and is "completed" by manual intervention. The print forms differ here between "In acceptance" and "Accepted". It is also possible to book the delivery note as a removal from stock, if the corresponding option "direct delivery" is set and the part of the delivery note item is kept in stock. In this case, the delivery note also provides the order quantity so that no further stock removal needs to be created. This is the description of the functionality of the module "delinote" with the name "Delivery note" regarding Business process of delivery notes: How the delivery note fits into the overall shipping process can be found here , a description of the delivery process can be seen here. To describe the processing status of the delivery note there are three relevant states. This is the description of the functionality of the module "delinote" with the name "Delivery note" regarding Subsequent deliveries: Delivery notes can also be used for internal subsequent deliveries: Example: If, for example, an order item has been delivered completely, but a subpart of this order item is broken on the construction site through the fault of the company's own employees and is to be delivered subsequently, a retrieval can simply be created with the order item as the predecessor and then a delivery note can be created for this retrieval and the goods sent afterwards. If a delivery note has been created for an entire order group and after a while it is discovered that parts belonging to this order group were inadvertently not sent after all, another delivery note can be created for these straggler items. This will then no longer change the delivery status of the order item. For this purpose, a new delivery note must be created and the order item must be dragged directly into this delivery note again or selected. A query is made as to whether the item, which has obviously already been completely delivered, should nevertheless be included in the delivery note. If this question is answered with YES, such a subsequent delivery note is created. This subsequent delivery note is placed at the end of the preceding delivery note in the document chain, i.e. it is not directly attached to the order item but to the preceding delivery note.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "delinote" with the name "Delivery note" regarding Delivery note as removal from storage: If a delivery note was created as a direct successor of an interim storage document, it also serves to remove the temporarily stored quantity from the interim storage again. In these cases the delivery note even appears in the warehouse statistics. It is also possible to book the delivery note as a removal from storage. If this option "direct stock removal" is set on the delivery note header under the area "Conditions", the system checks for each new delivery note item whether the part of the delivery note that has been resolved from the attributes is stock managed and, in the case of an existing order item as predecessor, whether the disposition status is "stock reservation". If so, the check mark "Direct removal from stock" is also set on the delivery note item and the stock level is adjusted when the delivery note is posted. The delivery note also increases the staged quantity of the order and is posted in the final costing. In the final costing, a delivery note is valued like a removal from stock. In this case, the delivery note also provides the order quantity so that no further stock removal needs to be created. For more information on interim storage, see its module description.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerpflege" with the name "Master data" regarding Preparation: Before the daily work in the ClassiX® application can begin, all master data must first be created. As all these data are related to each other in the program, as in real life, it is recommended to plan the creation of master data carefully and to proceed methodically during the input. First of all, gather all your data together, bring it up to date and organise it clearly. It is advisable to prepare the data in Excel, for example, as they can then be automatically transferred to the ClassiX® application. Any other structured file format can of course be used in the same way. Since almost every software application allows the output of your data into such structured files, you can also transfer the data directly from another system into ClassiX®. Please keep in mind that the new start always offers a good opportunity to revise your master data and its maintenance. Think carefully about which data you want to transfer from where and on which level and make sure that you can provide the data in a well structured way. It is equally important that you determine how master data once created should be maintained in the future so that it is always up-to-date. For example, where in your company should new customers, vendors, cost objects, etc. be created and who can and may continue to maintain them? Will data also come from other programs in the future, so that an interface is needed to guarantee the integrity of the data and avoid double data maintenance? If you have prepared yourself methodically in this way, you will see that the start with ClassiX® is hardly easier and faster. If you are already using other ClassiX® modules, everything will be even easier, because the data already created there will not have to be created again. Likewise, master data created in ClassiX®-Office or in ClassiX®-Financial Accounting are immediately available in ClassiX®-Office or ClassiX®-Financial Accounting in case of later extensions by additional ClassiX® modules. As the data is created in stages, some of the relationships have to be maintained. For example, you can only link the tax accounts to the client data after you have created both the client and the chart of accounts. Of course, all master data can also be created manually and maintained as described in the following section of this chapter. This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerpflege" with the name "Master data" regarding Clients/company: When you log in for the first time in a completely new ClassiX® application, you have to confirm the login window empty, because no users have been created yet. Next you have to create the client master data, because all further data should be saved client-dependent. In the client master data, it is important to define the fields 'Number' and 'DB layer' uniquely in order to functionally guarantee multi-client capability. Number' is the client number used in the system and 'DB layer' for the physical differentiation of clients at the database level. The currency must also be entered. Address data and telephone, etc. should also be entered because the program can then refer to these correctly if necessary. Finish each field entry with the 'Tab' key and do not forget to save your entries with 'OK'. The client window contains several pages/tabs between which you can scroll by clicking on the title of the page. By clicking on 'Accounting' - or by using the key combination 'Alt'-'R' - you get to the third page where you enter which cost accounting functions you use in your company. When you have completed all the fields, you can enter further company-related data, such as bank details on the 'Additional data' tab of the new window by clicking the 'Company' button. You will notice that overlapping information does not have to be re-entered, because in ClassiX® all data is logically linked. Later, this menu item allows you to switch between several clients created in the system. This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerpflege" with the name "Master data" regarding User - System User: This is where the users are created who should and may use your ClassiX® applications. The login name (user ID) and password must be entered. Furthermore, the personnel number and also a time limit for the validity of the login can be added. In the lower part of the window you can also define restricted access rights. If you have just created your login here when creating a new system, please log in to the system again. Since a real person should be assigned to the login if possible, it is recommended to first create the personal data in the ClassiX® partner administration. You can also do this later. In general, however, you should keep in mind that 'user' is only the role of one person, and one person may have several roles. If you first create the person and then assign one or more roles to this person, you can avoid double entries and you will always have your data well structured. However, system users do not have to be created as persons at the same time!. This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerpflege" with the name "Master data" regarding Financial year and periods: After the fiscal year has been created, the periods must be generated. If these correspond to the calendar months, they can be generated automatically, otherwise please create the sub-periods individually. You must also set the status of the period to be posted to in the sub-periods to 'started'. By double-clicking on one of the created periods you can edit it. Similar to the creation of the posting periods, you can also create the working calendars.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerpflege" with the name "Master data" regarding Basic data - tax rates: For the tax rates, enter the link to the corresponding tax accounts and also enter the link to your tax office after it has been created in partner management. You can also enter the tax office data immediately and then switch back to this window, as all objects created in ClassiX® are immediately available for general use. This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerpflege" with the name "Master data" regarding Basic data - Business conditions: Create condition with 'New': Confirm with 'OK', then via menu or right mouse button: Edit' - 'Cash discount rate' - 'Insert', e.g. 'Fixed due date Due date: 10 days - Tab - Percent: 0 A description of how to use it in the documents can be entered below:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerpflege" with the name "Master data" regarding Document management in ClassiX®: In general, your business documents are composed of several elements (document modules): Header first page (e.g. company logo, business address), salutation, footer first page, etc. They then compile a specific document from the predefined modules. You can enter the individual modules directly as text in the 'Document Module' window, but you can also create them in your standard word processing software, such as Microsoft Word. The modules can also be modular. This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerpflege" with the name "Master data" regarding Partner master data - companies, persons and contacts: All contacts in the ClassiX® applications see themselves as partners. ClassiX® only knows companies and persons as central information units about partners. These are assigned e.g. addresses, bank details, private data etc., information that is independent of the type of business relationship. Both companies and persons can have one or more roles, which define the business relations. For example, a person can be both employee and user, or a company can be both supplier and manufacturer. The relationships and roles can be entered as they actually are. Companies with branches and contact persons, persons with business and private addresses, etc. All data is entered redundancy-free and the relationships are clearly displayed. As in all lists, by entering the first letter(s), each entry can be found using various search fields. It is also easy to branch to related data, edit them or add or create new data. A letter or e-mail can also be created directly from here. Furthermore, the list can also be printed or loaded into the clipboard and is then available for further processing in other programs. Please note that the number of entries displayed in the company and person lists is limited in the standard setting in order to display these lists faster. If you do not find entries, this may be due to the fact that you cannot find them. If necessary, enter the first letter(s) in the search mask or increase the number of items displayed via the menu item 'Options'. This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerpflege" with the name "Master data" regarding Rolls: Roles are of special importance in ClassiX® applications, because they represent the relationships between your partners. Roles enable, for example, creditors who are simultaneously debtors or employees who are also system users, without double entry of data in the system. Companies and people with whom you do business are first and foremost all 'partners'. Only then are they assigned the respective roles (interested party, customer, supplier, bank, employee, etc.). If, for example, you need to create a new customer master record, you should therefore first check whether you have already created it as a company, possibly with the role 'prospect'. You can then assign a new role 'customer' to the corresponding company master data and your data will remain well structured and free of redundancies. Using the example of the roles, the advantages of the object-oriented structure of the ClassiX® applications become particularly clear. The relationships with and between all your business partners and their roles can only be depicted so realistically in the system by the consistent object-oriented concept. Thus, your master data maintenance is considerably simplified. If you create a new partner, a corresponding person or company entry is created at the same time as the first assigned role is created (the only exception is the entry as system user). That means, if a contact person is created, then this person is also entered as a person master record in ClassiX® and if a customer is created, then the corresponding company entry is made automatically. If this customer already exists, for example as a 'prospective customer', then duplicates will occur - and the relationship between the data will be lost. In this example, it is recommended to look up the company directory beforehand and, if necessary, mark the company data record there and then assign the additional property 'Customer' via the role icon. Then the window for entering the customer master data opens. You can also create the customer from here, for example, as a branch of an already registered company by clicking on the corresponding icon, then entering the company data and then setting up the role 'Customer'. If you have vendors with customer accounts, you can of course also add this additional role from the vendor master.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerpflege" with the name "Master data" regarding Example of roles - Assigning the role 'customer' to a company: If a company is already created in the partner administration, for example as a supplier, and now also becomes a customer, then you can simply add a new role to the existing entry. Select the entry in the list of companies and click on the role icon. Next click on 'Create', select the additional role of the partner and add it to the existing entry with 'Select'. The input mask for the customer data opens automatically (in this example). Most of the data is already taken from the supplier entry. You can now add or change the customer-specific data in this mask. If the customer number is not assigned automatically via the counter, you should assign and enter it. Then close the mask with 'OK' to save your entries! Now two roles are assigned to the company entry. If you do not see them immediately, close the mask once and open it again to display the list updated. You can edit the customer or supplier data by double-clicking on the respective role. This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerpflege" with the name "Master data" regarding Organise roles: The occurrence of duplicates cannot always be avoided. Especially if the company entries in the partner administration are maintained by different departments and/or employees. Even if you have transferred supplier and customer lists from another system when setting up ClassiX®, redundancies will probably have been carried along. However, you can organise these redundancies at any time later and thus eliminate them. In the classic case, there are creditors with debit balances, in other words suppliers who are also managed as customers. However, it is also conceivable that banks or even the tax office are also customers of your company. You can easily resolve duplicate entries and organise them correctly. First decide which existing entry you want to assign the additional role to and mark it in the company list. Banks and tax offices are a special feature here: If you want to assign an additional role to them, you must select the entry that is not already assigned the role 'bank' or 'tax office'. Next click on the role icon. Now you have opened the role window for the supplier entry in the example shown. Mark the role 'Supplier' and click on the icon 'Change partner'. Now arrange the two windows in such a way that you can click on the customer entry and drag and drop it into the role window. The role 'supplier', which was previously assigned to the entry with '.GmbH' in the example, is now added to the entry with '.company'. Confirm this action with 'OK' and close the role window again. The company entry '.company' now has both roles, customer and supplier, assigned as properties. The entry '.GmbH' has no role assigned and can be deleted. This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerpflege" with the name "Master data" regarding Employees: In this window you can create and manage your employees. The information necessary for the company can usually be entered in the fields directly or via the menu item 'Edit'. Telephone, fax, e-mail, etc. can also be maintained by clicking the right mouse button in the field 'Business Communication'. The employees created here can also be found in the system as persons. If you want to add private data, it is advisable to do this via the list of persons. Do not forget to link the employee to the corresponding system user if necessary. For the employee, you define the validity using the entry and leaving dates. Please remember, however, that the validity of the user entry is independent of this! This must be the case, for example, because you may want to block an employee's system access before he or she leaves the company or you may want to continue to grant system access after he or she has left the company. This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerpflege" with the name "Master data" regarding Data entry example - Company: The input mask for entering a new company address is called up via the Company module (command Insert Company under Edit). The various company-specific communication data (address, telephone, fax, e-mail, Internet), bank details, contact persons, branch offices, etc. are entered here. Any number of communication data, bank details, contact persons, branches and search terms can be assigned to a company. It is also possible to assign one or more industries to a company (command Industries under Edit). This branch assignment is a first example of the use of structures for the meaningful organisation of your data for the later creation of overviews and evaluations. Furthermore, notes and processes for a company can be created here. Via the company list, the recorded company is assigned, for example, the business role of prospective customer and, as such, the possible role of end customer. Using these role assignments, companies can be selected for certain mailing campaigns, for example. Contact persons can then be entered from the company mask. These are then automatically created as person objects. The role of a person, as in this example the contact person of a company, is displayed with the contact person button in the menu bar of the list of persons. The contact person button can be used to determine the company affiliation of a person.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerpflege" with the name "Master data" regarding Suppliers - Creditors: Creditors are called up via the menu item 'Partner'-'Suppliers' or the supplier icon. To create a new business partner, click on 'New' in the opened list. The supplier window opens, in which you can now enter the relevant data. To edit an existing business partner, double click on the corresponding entry in the supplier list. The fields in the editing windows are confirmed with the 'Tab' key. At the end all new entries are saved by clicking on 'OK'. However, before creating a new vendor, you should first check whether a company entry for this business partner may already exist in the partner administration. If this is the case, you only need to add the role 'Vendor' to the existing data record. The number range is determined internally and can be easily set up and managed via the counter. However, the number ranges of customers and vendors must not be identical and must not overlap. Enter master data: Very important: Now confirm this master data with the 'OK' button! Otherwise they will not be processed. Then continue on the page ADDITIONAL DATA: Otherwise, add the points as required by the company. Additional information can be entered either directly into the fields on the different tabs, via the menu item 'Edit' or in the list fields also via the right mouse button and 'Paste': When your details are complete, click 'New' to proceed to the next creditor. Click 'Close' to close the supplier system. This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerpflege" with the name "Master data" regarding Customers - Debtors: Customers are called up via the customer icon and created and maintained in the same way as vendors. This is the description of the functionality of the module "partnerpflege" with the name "Master data" regarding Banks: Here you create your bank details. On the 'Accounts' tab, you enter your account details with these banks and create the link to the cash accounts: If you want to use the automatic payment system, then you must of course enter all data completely.

This is the description of the module "qm_condBag_qm" with the name "Conditional table (CX_CONDITIONED_BAG)": This module checks all functions for conditional object tables. In the upper area you can see the current table with the conditions. Here you can add and remove as many conditions as you like. Adding is done by entering appropriate values in the fields and pressing the button. The first field is the operator for an integer, the second field contains the number for comparison. The third field contains the operator for a string comparison, the fourth field contains the comparison string. The two conditions are automatically linked with 'and'. The fifth field contains a CX_VALUE as result, which is returned if the whole condition is fulfilled. The middle area shows the objects that are currently in the plugspace. Here you can add and remove any objects. Only the data fields 'int' and 'str' have to be set, because they are used for comparison with the conditions. In the lower area, various methods of the class can now be checked by simply pressing the corresponding buttons. The respective result is displayed in the list between the buttons, or can also result in an error message. The checkboxes below can be used to control which flags should be set.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "security" with the name "Access rights for users" regarding Overview: The ClassiX® system offers a highly differentiated system for monitoring and restricting access rights. This security system of ClassiX® is optional, it can, but does not have to be used. However, a user can modify his database so that access is no longer possible without monitoring access rights. The access rights are described in the core by security objects. In addition, evaluations(stored lists) of authorised users can be activated for other - unauthorised - users. Security objects can prevent or allow the following: ¹) This refers only to persistent objects from the database. For transient objects there is no control of access rights! The security objects describing the access profile of a certain user are linked to the CX_USER object for this user and are activated at login (logged in to the ClassiX® system). Registered security objects remain active until the next start of the ClassiX® system, they cannot be deactivated again. Now there is still the possibility that unauthorised persons gain access to sensitive data with self-written InstantView® code. You can also protect yourself against this. If a database contains a master security object, any unauthorised access with InstantView® instructions is impossible. If you still want to see certain data, you have to develop your own programs in C++. If someone has the necessary means and energy, he/she can access not only the data objects but also information about the stored classes. That means this is a serious possibility to read or even modify protected data without authorization! In the last section of this overview we show how this entrance gate can also be closed!. This is the description of the functionality of the module "security" with the name "Access rights for users" regarding Access to data fields: As mentioned above, read and write access to certain data can be prevented. The scope of such restrictions may relate to The information on this level firstly affects all data fields of an object, including dynamic data fields of course. Different access rights can be assigned for certain access expressions (CX_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY). Objects of the class CX_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY are always subordinate to either a CX_CLASS_SECURITY or a CX_OBJECT_SECURITY object. The most general case of a description of read/write permissions applies to all access expressions for all objects of a certain class or classes derived from it, the most specific case concerns a very specific access expression when it is applied to a very specific individual object. Different security objects of the classes CX_CLASS_SECURITY and CX_OBJECT_SECURITY²can be combined with an object of the class CX_SECURITY_SET. By combining general and more specific statements, access rights can often be described with only a few objects. ²) this also applies to CX_MESSAGE_SECURITY and CX_SECURITY_OPTIONS, see below CX_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY objects never occur directly in the security set. If the ClassiX® system checks the authorisation of an access via access printout to a certain object and a security set is active, the first element of the set decides which one is applicable for the case. If none of the security objects in the security set provides a statement, access is prohibited. If a security object is active in the ClassiX® system, the following applies: Everything that is not explicitly allowed is prohibited! But this is no problem: A CX_CLASS_SECURITY object for the class CX_CLASS (and derived), which allows everything, forms a background for special deviating specifications. The order in the security set plays a role here: general statements may only come after the specific ones. Security sets may contain further security sets as an element. All descriptions of access rights can be represented by security objects in the correct arrangement in a security set. As a set, you can create subgroups of certain rights and then assign a combination of such subgroups to a user in a security set that combines the subgroups. There is another possibility: Put specializing security objects in the collection spezializations of a security object with a general statement. It makes no difference in terms of content whether the security objectS1 describing the special cases is located in a set before the object with the general definition S0, or whether only S0 is found in the set and S0 refers toS1 via specializations. However, the latter method is faster. Fewer objects have to be tested,S1 only checks if the parent object could already make a statement (see performance notes). This is the description of the functionality of the module "security" with the name "Access rights for users" regarding What happens in case of unauthorised access?: The AdjustView command resets the NON_SELECTABLE state if write permissions exist. By adjusting an input window with AdjustView before the user's input, one avoids that the final DrainWindow with error 638 can fail. This is the description of the functionality of the module "security" with the name "Access rights for users" regarding Create and logically delete objects: Permission or prohibition for this can only be given per class - with CX_CLASS_SECURITY objects. Everything that has been said about the possibilities of combination when it comes to access to data fields also applies here. The following InstantView® commands are affected:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "security" with the name "Access rights for users" regarding Lock InstantView® messages: When a security object of the class CX_MESSAGE_SECURITY is logged on to the ClassiX® system (usually as an element of the logged on CX_SECURITY_SET object), it blocks the message. The following InstantView® commands are affected: It makes sense to use the TestMsg instruction to adapt the menus or buttons of an application in such a way that the affected sub-applications cannot be selected in the first place. This is the description of the functionality of the module "security" with the name "Access rights for users" regarding Special messages for blocking functionality: In some modules of the AppsWarehouse®, functionality is limited due to blocked messages. The following messages are defined:.

This is the description of the module "repclass" with the name "REP classes (entities)": A root entry point (REP) is an entry point to the database marked with a name. Any object can be assigned to this entry point, usually list objects (collections) are made accessible via REPs. The basic entities of the CyberEnterprise® enterprise model, e.g. customers, parts, orders, invoices, etc., are kept in lists, each of which is assigned to an REP (defined in classix.odb ). Due to the navigation possibilities in the database, it is sufficient to search one or more objects (queries) once via such entry points, from which all further information can be read out of the database by navigation only. This is the description of the functionality of the module "repclass" with the name "REP classes (entities)" regarding Display window: This window displays the lists (collections) assigned to root entry points (REP).
Sure! Here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "repclass" module based on its description:

This is the description of the module "cxProceedings" with the name "Events": This module is used for the overview and processing of all transactions for a business object. For example, a business object can be a partner, a user or a part. The window title shows who the displayed transactions originate from. If the transactions are listed from a contact person, the window title shows not only the associated company, but also whether and from which company role the contact person was called. When creating transaction documents, this information controls whether the transaction folder of the company or the company role is placed in the transaction document in addition to the transaction folder of the contact person. Transactions primarily include transactions that are automatically posted to the transaction folder of the corresponding business object. This is done according to the transaction description of the individual document types, such as invoices, orders, etc. Subfolders (period, status, etc.) are also automatically created in which the documents are filed. In this way, a structure is created, as can be seen on the right-hand side, for example. (The number in brackets indicates how many receipts are in the corresponding folder.){img type="fileId" fileId="526" thumb="box" width="100%"}Furthermore, there are so-called transaction documents that are manually posted in transaction folders. These include letters, faxes and e-mails, but also simple notes or visit logs. To categorise these documents in transaction fold ers, a folder structure can also be created manually.The transaction folder is for master data what the document history is for documents. Thus, in addition to the transactions, documents and cost objects can also be displayed and partially maintained here. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxProceedings" with the name "Events" regarding General functionality of the Tasks folder: The folder is divided into two parts. On the left side the tasks/task folders are shown in the tree structure. The task documents can be displayed or not displayed here in the tree structure by option. Independently of the options the tasks of the selected folder are displayed on the right side. Also on the left side there is the possibility to view or change attributes, documents or cost units assigned to this object. The right mouse button opens context menus, which can be used to insert or remove object references. System folder/"normal" folders The colour of the folder shows whether it was created automatically or manually. The folders shown in red are the automatically created system folders that were created by posting a transaction based on a transaction description. Transaction documents in these folders can neither be moved nor removed and it is also not possible to insert other transaction documents or "simple" folders here. Folders shown in yellow are manually created folders. The user is free to edit these folders. Display of the transaction documents in the list The presentation of the transaction documents in the list can vary from folder to folder. For example, there is a standard format for the list if there are only transaction documents (letter, fax, etc.) in a folder. If a folder consists of subfolders (and transactions), the system switches to a general format. If a system folder has no subfolders but only transactions, the system tries to determine the list format automatically from the status monitor or workflow of the corresponding document type. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxProceedings" with the name "Events" regarding General process window: The task folders have a uniform layout with a general functionality. However, there are slight differences, for example between the task folder of the part and that of the user, customer, etc. Therefore it can happen that the described fields or menu items are not applicable or available for all task folders. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxProceedings" with the name "Events" regarding Option window: Used to set the option when using the operations folder. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxProceedings" with the name "Events" regarding List window: Used to list the transaction account objects. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxProceedings" with the name "Events" regarding Selection window: This window is for selecting a transaction folder or transaction account.
Sure! Based on the given module description, here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask:

This is the description of the module "cxIndustrialPlant" with the name "Industrial plants": This module is used to maintain industrial plants. These can be self-produced or externally produced plants. Equipment, instruments or even complex industrial plants are considered to be plants. A distinction is made between machines that are used in the company's own production process. Projects (cost objects) are (can be) assigned to facilities when they are created. Since most documents are assigned directly or indirectly to a cost object, the reference to an industrial plant is also always given. For example, an industrial plant can be indirectly linked to quotations and or orders via the project assignment (quotation or order header) or indirectly linked to plant group items in quotations and orders via its plant groups and components. One thus obtains an important information tool for service (listing of the service operations of Customer Support) and a reference work for sales and quality assurance. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxIndustrialPlant" with the name "Industrial plants" regarding Input window: When creating and editing industrial plants, the main mask "Industrial plants" is displayed first, which contains various tabs. In the "master data" tab, the main information of an installation, such as number, password, search terms, type, operator, owner, are specified. In the same window, in the group "Location/Communication data", the location of the system is specified, as well as the communication data on how to reach employees at the system location. For this purpose, the address, telephone number, etc. of the installation can be entered by right-clicking. Infrastructure data (characteristics) of the facility are inserted in the next tab ("Infrastructure data") via the "Insert" button. Asset groups and their components can be displayed graphically in the next tab and inserted with a right mouse click. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxIndustrialPlant" with the name "Industrial plants" regarding List window: This window serves to list industrial plants.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxIndustrialPlant" with the name "Industrial plants" regarding Absence note Create system consultant: An absence note is a special activity note that is posted to the capacity load of the assigned employee. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxIndustrialPlant" with the name "Industrial plants" regarding Move projects/orders/assembly groups: Projects, orders and plant groups can be moved between two industrial plants via this window. This window is needed because the normal editing window of the industrial plants can be opened twice and therefore drag&drop is not possible. Thus, the main use of this window is to open the plant group tree of a second industrial plant in order to be able to move positions of the project tree of the current industrial plant into it. Moving always takes place in the following direction: Project tree of the plant displayed in the editing window ->Plant group tree of the window "Move projects, orders and plant groups". After the objects have been moved, you can right-click in the attachment field of this window to jump to the target attachment. If you open the project tree here, you should be able to find the moved objects here. Orders are assigned to an industrial plant on the one hand via the cost object. and on the other hand, the plant group and work certificate groups of the orders refer to the components of the industrial plant. When orders are moved, these references are set to the new industrial plant. If an order group is moved, the new industrial plant is transferred to the cost object of the order. However, if a cost object has more than one order, the cost object can now refer to two industrial plants. This means that the remaining orders may also have to be moved. The user is informed of this via the following message: Moving/copying does not move all the asset/work certificate groups of the projects. The projects will therefore subsequently be assigned to several industrial plants. Do you still want to proceed?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "unitCalculator" with the name "Unit calculator" regarding Technical Documentation: Any functionality needed to create a calculator is already available in the classes CX_NUMERIC and CX_VALUE. If this application appears to be relatively large, it is because the calculator was designed to be as comfortable as possible. The "pure" arithmetic operations, such as the basic arithmetic operations or, for example, the formation of reciprocal values, are all available via the above-mentioned objects. With objects of the class CX_VALUE, it is also checked whether the arithmetic operation may be carried out at all (e.g. "2 m" + "4 sec" is an illegal calculation). The main part of the application, however, deals with the graphical display of the calculator and the implementation of special calculation methods (e.g. "point before line calculation", "percentage calculation" or also "faculty calculation"). This application shows very clearly that basic functionality, i.e. the "general case", is contained in the model classes, while special requirements, such as "dot before line calculation" are implemented with InstantView®.

This is the description of the module "cashDeposit" with the name "Cash book": The cash book is used to record the expenditure/receipts of a cash office. You can create as many cash registers as you wish, and keep a record of their respective stock. Cash vouchers can be immediately assigned to an account when they are entered, but it is important to keep the cash balance correct. A cash balance is done in 2 steps: first a cash report is created, whereby their cash receipts are removed from the current cash book. The cash documents of a cash report can be changed afterwards only with regard to their period or account assignment. In the second step a cash report can then be transferred to the financial accounting. The cash documents of a cash report posted in financial accounting cannot be changed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cashDeposit" with the name "Cash book" regarding Cash book entry, cash invoice, cash sale: The standard case of a cash book transaction is a cash book entry, which consists of a transaction description, a revenue/expenditure amount and, if applicable, a tax value. If you want to put brackets around several cash book entries, this is a cash invoice. Cash invoices can be incoming and outgoing invoices. In the case of incoming invoices, for example the entry of a petrol station invoice for petrol and food, it is possible to enter the number of the invoice freely. Among other things, you can select a supplier as a partner. Then you can add the items to the cash invoice. This step hardly differs from the "normal" functionality of the cash book. The cash invoice becomes interesting when selling goods without open items, the so-called cash sale. When entering these invoices, the invoice number is automatically assigned via a separate number range. An invoice recipient does not have to be selected, but in addition to a customer created in ClassiX, it could also be a one-time customer whose data is only recorded in the invoice. Especially for the second case, it may be useful to select a price base group (price group, customer group, sales area). For cash sales invoices it is possible to specify a part and a quantity. Here, the stocked part or subparts must be indicated directly. The selection of a variant part is not possible, as this cannot be in stock. The sales price is determined automatically as revenue. After the cash invoice has been recorded, it can be printed and handed over to the customer. The second step is to create the stock removal so that the stock level correction can be carried out. This is done automatically via the menu "Further processing". As long as this step has not been carried out, it is not possible to generate the cash report. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cashDeposit" with the name "Cash book" regarding Main window: This window is used for the maintenance of account books.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cashDeposit" with the name "Cash book" regarding Create cash report: The creation of a cash report from current cash documents can be called up via the main menu "Edit>Cash report>Create". Here, either selected documents can simply be printed, or documents up to a consecutive number can be transferred (closed and posted) as a cash report. The transfer of the cash vouchers into a new cash report may only take place in a continuous number range from the smallest number not transferred to the number to be entered. If the option "Selected items" is activated, no closing can be created. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cashDeposit" with the name "Cash book" regarding Cash report: Window for displaying the cash documents of a cash report. Even after the creation of a cash report - but only before the posting in the financial accounting - the cash report entries can be changed with regard to their account assignment, the change of an amount is no longer allowed at this point. Editing can be done either by double-clicking on a single entry or by selecting several entries, right-clicking and selecting "Account Assistant". In the latter case, changes can be made to the account assignment of individual entries, particularly by the financial accounting department, before posting a cash report. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cashDeposit" with the name "Cash book" regarding Edit cash report: Window for subsequent processing of a cash voucher that has already been converted into a cash report.

This is the description of the module "salecedt" with the name "Sub-assembly set": The assembly set is a special form of a sales set, except that it is manufactured together with all its order sub-items in a production order, also known as an order bill of materials - a production bill of materials defined in the order. The resulting bill of materials is thus composed of all order items created in the order below the assembly set. The production bill of materials is practically already defined at order item level. In the parts master, the assembly set part has a production role without a bill of materials, but with a routing that contains the assembly only the assembly work of the individual components. Subassembly sets can also be used as purchased parts with own provision. If such a subassembly set is available in the order, one practically determines at the order level through sub-items which goods are to be provided for the order and in which quantities. With the technical release the disposition of the parts to be provided is initiated and the requirement request for the assembly set part is created. Conditional individual parts in sets Conditional individual parts can be included in sets. Characteristics can be assigned to these conditional individual parts, which later appear in the offer or order items. If no characteristics were entered for these conditional individual parts, the quotation or order item automatically takes the characteristics of the selected individual part from the parts master. If conditional items are present in an assembly set, the assembly set in the order is not exploded automatically, but must be exploded using the "Generate plant components" button after the attributes on the assembly set order item have been set according to customer specifications (e.g. mains voltage etc.), because this may be the basis for the conditional sub-items of the assembly set. Attention: If, after resolving the conditional assembly set items, the attributes on the assembly set item are changed, the resolved subpart of a conditional item does not change automatically! In this case the subitems must all be deleted and the assembly set must be exploded again! Characteristics of the lower parts When sub-parts are added to sets, all characteristics of the selected part are copied from the part master into the characteristics of the new sub-position of the set. These can now be set as desired and are then valid for all quotation/order items created from this set, if the characteristics have not been explicitly defined and thus overwritten. Calculation and quantity calculation for main and sub-items Type 4 (main part plus integrated individual parts) is the default setting and cannot be changed. However, the system distinguishes a total of five types (Types) of how subitems are assembled with the main item (see the "Type" field displayed on the first tab "Offer/Order item" if a main item has been loaded); this defines the pricing rules and quantity calculation. Description: (see order item). This is the description of the functionality of the module "salecedt" with the name "Sub-assembly set" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain the assembly sets. You can select an assembly set by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. By selecting the menu item 'Search' the list window is called up. Via the tab 'Individual parts' the individual parts of the assembly set can be maintained. It is possible to insert individual parts (sales article, spare part, performance unit) directly or to specify the use of the sub parts via a conditional table to control. Individual parts | parts list entry | upper Various input windows are available for maintaining the individual parts of an assembly set: Structure.

This is the description of the module "inprovis" with the name "Customer Supplies": If a customer places an order but already has parts in stock that could be used in this order, a customer provision document can be created from the parts request. To do this, select the part for which the customer provision is to be created in the parts requisition, open the context menu with the right mouse button and select the entry "Change main disposition-->Customer provision". When the parts requisition is processed further, more precisely when the first purchase requisition (or straggler purchase requisition) is created, a customer provision document is created for the customer provision item, which automatically pulls the following data from the parts requisition item: Part Description of the part Quantity Deployment date Customer from order header (is entered in the provision header) The created provision is treated as an order in the further business process. This means that a goods receipt must be created as a follow-on document containing the quantity received from the customer. The goods receipt must therefore also follow the usual route of provision from goods receipt. Consequently, the customer provision documents now also appear in the list of open orders. If only a partial quantity of the parts requisition item is to be provided by the supplier, this can only be done in the case of material withdrawals and purchase requisition parts requisition items. The required quantity must be reduced manually! The same applies to the quantity on the stock withdrawal document!

This is the description of the module "cxCombinedNomenclature" with the name "Combined Nomenclature": In the context of trade in goods into and out of the EU, the goods supplied must be classified by commodity code. This module is used to load, compare and maintain commodity codes according to the combined nomenclature of the EU and the SOVA master file of the Federal Statistical Office in Germany. The Combined Nomenclature is the classification of goods (list of commodity numbers) issued by the EU for statistical purposes in intra-Community trade (eurostat). The Federal Statistical Office of the Federal Republic of Germany provides the nomenclature in the form of the commodity code index as a link to the Sova master file (e.g. for the year 2012 in the file SOVA2012.txt). In addition, data on eurostat are also available as a download on the pages of the European Commission(http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon). There you can find the download of the combined nomenclature (in different official languages) under the metadata on the classification server and further as a selection of the combined nomenclature of the respective current year (e.g. for 2012: Combined Nomenclature, 2012). The entry "Structure of the classification in various formats: ANS, HTML, MDB, UDB, UTX, WXT, XML (these formats are described in the document "formaten.pdf")/Structure of the classification in various formats: ANS, HTML, MDB, UDB, UTX, WXT, XML (a document describing these formats is included)", whereby with this module the loading of data is currently only supported with files in .ans/.anf format. Since the total scope of these commodity number directories far exceeds the classification required by a company in the partial master, only those commodity numbers are (should be) maintained with this module that are actually required and used.The above data of the Combined Nomenclature are published annually and must be checked against the own data.

This is the description of the module "user" with the name "User": This app is used to maintain the users who are allowed to use your ClassiX® applications. In addition to a user's login information, such as ID and password, access rights can also be defined here.As a rule, it is the "own" employees of the clients defined in the system who are users. Being a user therefore means that a person - in addition to his or her role as an employee - has the additional role of user. The registration of a user is therefore in the true sense the registration of a user role.This also makes it possible to assign user roles to contact persons of other companies. Unlike employees, contact persons of other companies do not have an employee role as an employee of a "system client", but a contact person role as an employee of another company. This means that these persons can also be given another role as a user of their system. (e.g. their tax advisors or auditors - but also temporary agency workers - who continue to be and remain the contact person of the external company).If such "external" users also carry out activities in which, for example, documents are created with input/output of contact data, it makes sense to store this contact data (e-mail, telephone extension number) - purely in the role as user - directly at the user role. Otherwise, there is a risk that the system will take over the contact data of the "foreign" contact person role when printing a document or sending an e-mail.Even if, for example, the employees in the sales department are only to be contacted via a collective e-mail (e.g. sales@myCompany.com), this collective e-mail can be stored for each of these users in their user role. In the employee role itself, the actual contact data for internal company traffic can then remain unchanged and unmistakable.In addition to the user role-specific contact data, a user can also be assigned his or her own first place of work.In addition to user roles that can be assigned to a natural person, one occasionally needs user roles that cannot be permanently assigned to a specific person. This is the case, for example, if the system is to be used by "third parties", e.g. for anonymous use via an interface (API). For such cases, user roles can also be assigned to companies (legal persons). Whether the assignment is made to one's own company (e.g. for night runs) or to a third-party company (e.g. the operator of the online shop that transmits data) is not relevant here.In principle, it is also possible to create user roles without any assignment to a natural or legal person. However, the change history of data then also has gaps. This is the description of the functionality of the module "user" with the name "User" regarding Input window: This window is for user maintenance. You can select a user by entering the required abbreviation in the User ID field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to open the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". The login name (user ID) and password must be entered. Furthermore, the personnel number and also a time limit for the validity of the login can be added. In the lower area of the window, it is also possible to define restricted access rights. If you have just created your login here when using the system for the first time, please log in to the system again. Since a real person should be assigned to the login if possible, it is recommended to first create the personal data in the ClassiX® partner administration. You can also do this later. In general, however, you should keep in mind that 'user' is only the role of one person, and one person may have several roles. If you first create the person and then assign one or more roles to this person, you can avoid double entries and you will always have your data well structured. However, system users do not have to be created as persons at the same time!. This is the description of the functionality of the module "user" with the name "User" regarding List window: Used to list the users. This is the description of the functionality of the module "user" with the name "User" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select a user. This is the description of the functionality of the module "user" with the name "User" regarding User settings: This window allows the user logged in to ClassiX® to set his own settings. This window differs from the editing window in which the administrator can set the user settings. In contrast to the editing window, administrative settings, such as access rights, cannot be changed via this window. This is the description of the functionality of the module "user" with the name "User" regarding Set password: This window allows you to give a password directly to a user. This password can be entered as a temporary or a final password. If a temporary password is assigned, the user must change it to a final password immediately after login. Field Description User: New password Enter the new password. Repeat : Enter the new password again to check that both entries are the same. Set as temporary password This is useful, for example, if a user cannot request a password for himself by e-mail. The administrator can then do this for the user, but the user must change the password immediately after the first login. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the provided module description:

1. Can users be assigned multiple roles within the "User" module?
2. How does the system differentiate between user roles assigned to natural persons versus legal entities?
3. What is the purpose of storing contact data for external users in their respective user roles?
4. Can user roles be created without assigning them to a specific person or entity?
5. How does the system handle changes to user data in the absence of a change history?
6. What is the difference between the "Edit" and "Set Password" windows in the "User" module?
7. Can administrators modify access rights through the "User Settings" window?
8. Is it necessary to create a person record before assigning a user role to a natural person?
9. Can users change their own passwords through the "Set Password" window?
10. Are temporary passwords subject to the same complexity requirements as final passwords?

I hope these questions provide a good starting point for exploring the capabilities of the "User" module!

This is the description of the functionality of the module "user" with the name "User" regarding Single sign-on: Single sign-on (SSO) defines a functionality that is intended to simplify the handling of the large number of logins of the Windows applications used by reducing them to a single login routine. As a Windows logon has always been carried out at the start time of ClassiX®, the ClassiX® single sign-on functionality refers to this. To activate SSO in ClassiX®, the corresponding Windows Security Identifier ( SID ) must be entered in the Windows SID field in the user administration. If, when ClassiX® is started, exactly 1 of the Windows SIDs stored there matches the Windows SID of the Windows user, the login is automatically carried out with the values of the user found. The SSO functionality applies to the User + Login and Client + User + Login variants. When "Re-Login" to ClassiX®, the SSO functionality is bypassed.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "User" module with regards to Single Sign-On (SSO):

This is the description of the module "cxTxnNote" with the name "Operation note": On the one hand, an activity note documents a completed activity(activity), such as a conducted meeting, an activity instruction or a written letter, but on the other hand, it also documents a planned activity(planning). If an activity note is marked as "planning", it automatically receives the status "resubmission" from the selected business process, if there is one. These resubmissions can then be called up via the "My resubmissions" list and checked by interval. Both activity and planning can be active or passive. Active transactions are outgoing from the own company to a partner. Passive transactions are incoming from an external partner to one's own company (e.g. customer calls me, customer writes an e-mail to me, etc.). Activity or planning can be marked as "completed" to track processing.One or more recipients can be assigned to an activity note. For each individual recipient, a document is printed or an e-mail or fax is sent. Depending on what is selected as the type of transaction (letter, fax, e-mail, etc.), the corresponding contact information is output next to the name of the recipient, i.e. address, fax number or e-mail address. This means that transaction notes can also be used, for example, to create serial letters. These can be changed via the context menu on the corresponding line. Any number of transaction notes can be assigned to all business objects - organised via transaction folders. A business object can be, for example, a partner, a partner function (e.g. supplier), a part, a part function (e.g. the production function), a parts list, etc. or even another document, such as an order, an invoice or another transaction note. On the other hand, each operation note itself can be linked to any number of business objects. The transaction notes are then posted in these transaction folders and thus support the workflow of information. Transaction notes can also be created directly from a business object by specifying the transaction type (note, letter, telephone call, etc.). If the transaction type is letter, fax or e-mail, the business object (the partner or partner function) is automatically entered as the recipient, otherwise only its transaction folder is automatically registered in the transaction note.If the business object is a contact person, the transaction folder of the contact person's company or the company function from which the contact person was called is also inserted next to the transaction folder of the contact person.With transaction notes, customer contact management in the sense of CRM functionality is possible: storage of information about e.g. telephone calls, correspondence and e-mail communication with the customer(activities), or planning with usually a resubmission, e.g. to promote marketing/sales campaigns.Any number of external documents can be added to a transaction note. Word texts, Excel tables and drawings are displayed directly and the objects can be edited by double-clicking. To show on each page whether external documents have been added to a transaction note, their number appears directly on the corresponding tab. The list shows both the type of file and the application registered for this type. For security reasons, the documents added here are assigned directly to the transaction note and are not maintained as associations within the document history.Furthermore, a description can be entered for each external document (via the 'Description' button). As a last piece of information, the file name under which the file was/is stored on the hard disk is also entered. All attached files are sent as attachments when they are sent by e-mail. The processing of all Microsoft Office file types is guaranteed by default.In order to create document chains (for one and the same activity/planning), follow-up documents can also be created from an activity note. These are used, for example, to track the customer contact regarding a topic, e.g. first telephone call - info mail sent - second telephone call - presentation - third telephone call, etc. The links between a transaction note and its predecessor or successor documents are displayed in the document links tab.Each transaction note is assigned to a business process and can assume different statuses, which are controlled manually. New business processes can be created for the transaction notes at any time. The indicator of the new business process must start with "TXN_NOTE_WFL" to be recognised as a transaction note process.The field"Processor" identifies the employee or cost centre who must complete this "task" or in whose processes and possibly resubmissions this activity note is posted.You can find information on printing task notes here. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxTxnNote" with the name "Operation note" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain transaction notes. You can select an operation note by entering the number of the desired operation note in the "Number" field and confirming with RETURN. When creating an activity note, the date, time, type, creator and editor (from the logged-in user) and - if not specified otherwise - the activity folder of the user - are predefined. If a recipient is selected, the process is also registered in the recipient's process folder. The process note number is automatically assigned after saving the process note. The text field ("Message" field) of the receipt can also be entered in Word format. This happens automatically when you create the document as a letter or fax ("Transaction type" field, but only if transaction type is "active") or when you call up the menu item manually (Edit -> Format -> MS-Word). Saved transaction notes can be copied or a follow-up document can be created:. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. Can we assign multiple recipients to an activity note? How many recipients can we assign?
2. What types of transactions can be documented using cxTxnNote? Are there any limitations on the types of transactions that can be recorded?
3. Can we add external documents to an activity note? If so, how do we add them, and what types of documents can we add?
4. Is it possible to create follow-up documents from an existing activity note? If yes, how do we create them?
5. Can we change the status of an activity note from "planned" to "completed"? And vice versa?
6. How do we print or send documents related to an activity note? Can we customize the printing or sending options?
7. Can we associate multiple business objects with an activity note? If so, how do we associate them?
8. Does cxTxnNote offer any reporting features? If so, what kind of reports can we generate?
9. Can we set up automatic reminders or notifications for activity notes? If so, how do we configure them?
10. Can we integrate cxTxnNote with other modules or systems? If so, how do we go about integrating it?

I hope these questions cover most aspects of the module description!

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxTxnNote" with the name "Operation note" regarding Serial letters or circulars with personal cover letters: A transaction note can be used as a form letter or circular mail if several recipients are inserted in the recipient tab. In this way you can, for example, invite people to a trade fair or carry out comparable marketing campaigns. Now you want to address each addressee personally in your circular. A standard "Dear Sir or Madam" letter is not enough for you. You can implement this using document variables, which can be used depending on the cover letter type (Word or text). In Word, the variables are inserted in the way described here. If the message is entered as text, the access expression within the text must be enclosed by the following character string: "This is the text before the variable << access expression >> This is the text after the variable." In some cases, the access expression does not return a result. In order to still return a standard text in these cases, you can add two "OR characters" with the alternative text within the access expression. In the following example, the contact person of a transaction note is to be addressed personally. If this person is not known, a standard form of address is to be used:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxTxnNote" with the name "Operation note" regarding Emails with Cc/Bcc recipients and circulars: Transaction notes can be of the type "email" on the one hand and of the type "circular email" on the other. In the case of an "email", exactly one email is sent. All selected recipients are set as recipients of this one email. The recipients can also be set to the type "Cc" or "Bcc". To do this, proceed as follows: However, it is also possible - as described in the previous section - to send circular e-mails. In this case, not one e-mail is sent to all recipients, but one e-mail per recipient, ideally even with an individual cover letter. To do this, select the type "E-mail (circular)". If one or more recipients have been set to the type "Cc" or "Bcc", these recipients will not receive the e-mail directly as the main recipient, but will receive a copy or blind copy of all e-mails. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxTxnNote" with the name "Operation note" regarding List window: The list window is used to list operation notes. The list can be filtered through the upper search fields. The filter can consist of several fields at the same time. However, if the "number" is searched for, all other fields are reset (since the number of an operation note is always unique). Any entry in another field resets the "number" field. The window title always shows from which basic set or from which folder the displayed operation notes originate: e.g. "All operation notes" if listed from the set of all operation notes or "Operation notes from" if it is about operation notes of e.g. a user or "Operation notes in" if the operation notes originate from a subfolder. The display "Inserted operation notes" appears if the operation notes were taken over into the list by dragging and dropping other objects. The following objects can be dragged into the list by drag&drop: The additional display "( filtered )" appears if a value was entered in the search mask and the list is thus filtered according to these criteria. Double-clicking on an entry in the list or selecting an entry in the list and then pressing the "Edit" button in the input window opens the input mask for editing the activity note. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxTxnNote" with the name "Operation note" regarding Options window: In the options window, a default process and a default status can be defined, which are automatically set when a new operation note is created. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxTxnNote" with the name "Operation note" regarding Resubmission of operations (actions): The resubmission serves as a reminder to the user of transaction notes by means of a pop-up window. This window displays all task notes that are of the type "action", have a resubmission date in the past and are not marked as completed. The task notes are assigned to a user via the task folders. It is therefore also possible to have a resubmission document pop up for another user. This can be done by selecting another user in the group "To task folder of" via the insert menu.

This is the description of the module "product" with the name "Production part": The production part is a part roll and contains the relevant production data. This module is used to maintain production parts. A new production part can be created in two ways: From the input window of the parts master via menu item New button in the editing / list window of the production part If the production part is called up from the input window of the part master, the system first checks whether a roll of this type already exists and displays it if necessary. Otherwise a new production part is created and connected to the part master (only after saving). On the tab 'Production data' the data from the part master are taken over, which must be supplemented by the missing points. With the second option, a new part master record is created for the production part when saving, which you should maintain afterwards. A production part can be defined as a normal assembly (part has a bill of material and routing), factory assembly (part has no bill of material, only a routing), MRP assembly (the production part has its own MRP bill of material and is only defined from a logistics point of view) or engineering assembly (the part is not "seen" from a logistics point of view). This is the description of the functionality of the module "product" with the name "Production part" regarding Input window: You can select a production part by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to open the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". This window is divided into the different flaps.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "product" with the name "Production part" regarding Option window: All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed with the "OK" button. This is the description of the functionality of the module "product" with the name "Production part" regarding Production cost allocation or calculation: As a matter of principle, the production costs for a part are divided into two cost areas that are valued differently: Wage costs and material costs. The costs of a production part, taking into account all the necessary wage and material costs on the basis of the master parts lists and routings, are taken over by the preliminary parts calculation. As a standard, the additional costs incurred in addition to wages and materials, e.g. for purchasing or stock management of the required parts, are included in the overheads. These are stored globally in the client. However, the following approach is preferable in order to be able to calculate production costs precisely according to other costs incurred during production, such as machine running costs and programming costs, without having to include all costs invisibly in overheads: In the part or at the work plan position, a material characteristic must be defined which contains the costs for e.g. the machine costs per hour according to the following format costs = 120€/h (see below in the picture in the work sequence). You must therefore create a material characteristic for each cost element. The characteristic can also be stored directly on variant parts and can also calculate itself there from other boundary conditions (calculated or conditional characteristics). To be able to take these costs into account, a formula in the resource of the work sequence is necessary (in the picture the standard costs of the working group): Standard costs = formula = costs+(40€/1h) Since the formulae do not know any compound units, instead of 40€/h --> write 40€/1h and put this in brackets. The machine costs per hour specified via the material characteristic are now added to the standard machine costs per hour. In order to check whether the costs are actually there without any error occurring, the formula can be extended by a query as follows In this case, the system queries in advance whether the costs have been found and otherwise uses the value 0?, whose unit is based on the next component for further calculation. In the preliminary parts calculation we then immediately see the result: The marked line is our work sequence, which has received wage costs of 1.600€ for 600 minutes (10 hours) (120€ machine running costs + 40€ standard costs = 160€ per hour * 10 hours = 1600€).

This is the description of the functionality of the module "scanner_main_processes_outbound_shiptocustomer_app_scanner" with the name "Scanner goods issue to customer" regarding PickAndCollect customer: Event The warehouse employee selects a picking list and picks the goods from this picking list lying in his picking zone onto a picking cart or other picking container (pick container). As soon as the trolley/container is full or there are no further picks for this picking list in the picking zone, the warehouse worker places the trolley/container in a storage area for further processing. Usually this is a storage bin in one of the following storage areas During storage, the warehouse employee is shown whether the goods need to be consolidated (e.g. because goods from other picking zones still need to be picked for this picking list) and whether goods from this picking list are already picked in another storage bin. The warehouse employee tries to place the goods in the same storage bin where goods from this picking list are already stored. The strategies for depositing are defined customer-specifically in each case. The following entry points are available The menu item Settings is used to define the pick zone. If no pick zone has been selected, the selection of the pick zone appears automatically when the other three menu items are selected. This is the description of the functionality of the module "scanner_main_processes_outbound_shiptocustomer_app_scanner" with the name "Scanner goods issue to customer" regarding PickAndDrop customer: Event Goods that have to be picked as individual picks (e.g. whole pallets or large parts) are picked up individually by a forklift and transported directly to the appropriate place in one of the zones turned off. The pick to be made is automatically assigned to the warehouse employee. He has the choice of specifying a picking list (picking list selection via picking licence) or simply selecting the next pending pick without taking a picking list into account (automatic picking list selection). When parking, the warehouse employee is shown whether the goods need to be consolidated (e.g. because goods from other picking zones still need to be picked for this picking list) and whether goods from this picking list are already picked in another storage bin. The warehouse employee tries to place the goods in the same storage bin where goods from this picking list are already stored. This is similar to the storage of goods at PickAndCollect. The strategies for filing are defined customer-specifically in each case. The following three entrances are available: The Settings menu item is used to define the forklift trucks assigned to the employee and to select the picking zone in which the warehouse employee works. The second selection only appears if there is more than one truck picking zone. This is the description of the functionality of the module "scanner_main_processes_outbound_shiptocustomer_app_scanner" with the name "Scanner goods issue to customer" regarding Transport of goods: In the picking process, picked goods are placed in storage aids (PickAndCollect) or the goods are already in storage aids (PickAndDrop - storage aids). These are placed in storage bins after the picking process. In the case of large parts, it is ensured that these are placed on a storage aid after picking, which in turn is placed in a storage bin. The following entries are available: Under Settings, the warehouse employee selects the forklift truck as with PickAndDrop. Then he can pick up the licence to be transported. If the settings have not been run through, the selection of the stacker appears automatically when the other menu items are selected.

Remarks: The goods can be consolidated before dispatch. There are several possible combinations with "Pack for customer". See also "Processes - Outgoing goods - To customer - Consolidation customer". Packing can only be started when all the goods in a pick list are in exactly one shipping zone. If the goods are in several shipping zones, they must first be brought to the zone where the packing process takes place. Normally this is done with " Processes - Outgoing goods - To customer - Goods transport - Transport picked licence", but it is also possible with "Processes - Outgoing goods - To customer - Consolidation customer". The following entries are available:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "scanner_main_processes_outbound_shiptocustomer_app_scanner" with the name "Scanner goods issue to customer" regarding Consolidation Customer: After the picking process, the picked goods are placed on the storage locations. Depending on the case, an order of the goods suitable for shipping can already be achieved when picking the goods or when subsequently depositing the goods. If this is not the case, the goods can be consolidated. This saves space and thus shipping costs. Remarks: The employee is already informed when the picked goods are deposited that they have to be consolidated. As a rule, the goods are then placed in a staging area so as not to get in the way of goods that can be packed directly. The function "Processes - Outgoing goods - To customer - Pack for customer - Pack licence" can also be used for the pick containers standing in the staging area. The following entries are available:.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_documentEditing" with the name "Example printing (form creation)" regarding Comparison printing via MS Word with printing via XML: There are currently two printing methods, printing via MS Word and printing via XML. This section gives a first overview of how the printing methods work and their advantages and disadvantages. A more detailed description is given below. In general, printing via MS Word can be described as follows. At the beginning of the printing process, an empty Word document is created. Subsequently, the document modules assigned to the document are successively inserted into the generated empty Word document. The type or the sequence of blocks defines when and where the blocks are inserted. For example, the type "Footer" creates the footer of the document. The result is that the initially empty Word document is filled with content and can now be printed, saved, etc. When printing via XML, a template is stored behind the document. This specifies the layout of the printout. This can be done on the one hand by referring to the document modules to be used, but the content can also be stored directly in the template. For example, a reference can be made in the footer of the template that the document module is to be dragged to print the footer or the content can be stored directly in the footer of the template. When printing, the layout is dragged and evaluated (memorised), thereby setting the contents of all placeholders (document variables). The template is a Word XML document which is only converted into a Word document as a COM object after preparation. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_documentEditing" with the name "Example printing (form creation)" regarding Create a new document for XML printing: This section shows an example of how to create a new document for printing delivery notes. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_documentEditing" with the name "Example printing (form creation)" regarding Creating a document: The first step in creating a new document is to create the document itself. In this example, the document is given the number "SDN" and the name "Delivery note". The area "Sales" is defined in the application area and the restriction can be used to set that the document is only valid for delivery notes (class CX_DELIVERY_NOTE). {img type="fileId" fileId="281" thumb="box" width="100%"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_documentEditing" with the name "Example printing (form creation)" regarding Creating the template: The decisive step is now the creation of the template. The template is saved as a Word document in the directory "CX_ROOTDIR\appswh\data\Template\Forms\CX_PROJECT_NAME" under the name of the document, in this case defaultTemplate.doc. The template could look something like this. It has a header and a footer with corresponding document variables, which are described in the same way. It also has two section changes and further document variables. {img fileId="282" thumb="box" width="100%"} However, there are also a few hidden document variables. If you insert a few line breaks before the first section break, you will see that the document has a different header on the following page. The same applies to the two sections defined by the section breaks. The document variables, which are described in the next table, ensure that the content is read from the document modules defined in the document and inserted at the appropriate place. Alternatively, the content could also be inserted directly into the template as described above. Thus, one could remove the document variable "call(XMLPrintListHeader)" for inserting the building block of the list header and define the list header here directly, as the following image shows. {img fileId="284" thumb="box" width="100%"} However, it is also possible to insert content into the template without using document modules. This is even much easier, but does not offer the possibility of encapsulating modules and using them several times. It is easier because you can insert the content directly in the template. For example, it would be conceivable to insert the list header of the position list directly in the header of the template instead of the document variable "call(XMLPrintListHeader)". The same applies to the document header, footer and so on. And although you do not go via the document modules in this case, document variables can still be used as placeholders for inserting ClassiX data, such as "uniqueID" for inserting the document number. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the provided module description:

1. How many printing techniques are available in the processes_documentEditing module?
2. What exactly is the purpose of the "type" or "sequence of blocks" in printing through Microsoft Word?
3. Can you describe the distinction between printing via MS Word and printing via XML in the context of the processes_documentEditing module?
4. How does the module "processes_documentEditing" handle footers and headers in the documents it produces?
5. Is it possible to add content straight to the template rather than utilizing document modules in the processes_documentEditing module?
6. Can you provide examples of the types of document variables employed in the processes_documentEditing module to represent content from other modules?
7. How does the module "processes_documentEditing" manage various document headers and footers depending on the particular document being produced?
8. Can you walk me through how to produce a new document for printing delivery notes using the processes_documentEditing module?
9. Can you tell me what happens when a user modifies a template in the processes_documentEditing module? Does the change affect future prints?
10. Are there any restrictions on the sorts of files that may be printed using the processes_documentEditing module?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_documentEditing" with the name "Example printing (form creation)" regarding Document modules: Document modules are used to manage Word documents that are inserted into the template. The documents must be assigned an ID, which must be unique so that the documents can be exported and imported. It is advisable to name the modules like the document into which they are to be inserted, supplemented by an abbreviation describing the type. It could also be a consecutive number, but then the ID would not be meaningful. The following extensions have been established using the example of the document "SDN". The type of the document module controls which task the module fulfils and where it is to be inserted. Thus, the module "list header" is inserted at all the places in the template where the document variable "call(XMLPrintListHeader)" has been defined. The Word document can be stored conditionally in the document modules. These can be fixed conditions, such as whether the module "Header" is to be inserted on the first page or on the following page. However, the conditions can also be formulated depending on general system information (e.g. query regarding the logged-in client) or data of the document to be printed (e.g. query regarding the order type), etc. The "document header" module has a special feature, which is usually always conditional. There is a condition for the first page ("print.counter=11111"). The document that was stored here is output as the document header. The Word document behind the condition for the next page ("print.counter=99999"), on the other hand, is used for the header of the next page. The advantage is that despite a uniform header across all documents on the first page, an individual document header can be set up on the following pages without the need for a document. In addition to the Word document, the module can also define options such as "new page before the module". However, these options are only valid for blocks of the type "list position" or "list groups" as well as the blocks which are freely inserted before or after the list. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_documentEditing" with the name "Example printing (form creation)" regarding Document variables: In the MS-Word Editor the layout design for the document header can be created. If you have no experience in using MS-Word with dynamic data fields, it is recommended to first create a static layout design by defining the formatting of tables, fonts and inserted graphics (see above figure).

This is the description of the module "capcheck" with the name "Capacity utilisation": This module was implemented in order to get an overview of the overall utilisation of all resources in the company. It offers the possibility to see at a glance for a selected time period by means of green, yellow and red boxes, whether the actual booked workload is higher than the planned capacity, which is available to a resource, e.g. due to assigned employees (e.g. 4 employees of 40 hours each per week = 160 hours capacity at the machine). Employee deployment planning This capacity utilisation list can also be used for the scheduling of employees: Tasks from service provider groups, work orders and service assignments are posted to the employee's planning pool. In this way, it is possible to monitor which employee is working at what time and to what extent, or where he or she may be out in the field, absent due to holidays, illness or other reasons, or whether he or she is on emergency duty for the selected calendar week. For the capacity planning of employees there are a few special features: Flexitime days Flexitime absences can be entered via the employee mask. These are then displayed in the overview with a blue symbol with a white square. This should then mean that the employee is free (blue means no capacity due to holidays, illness or other absence), but can be contacted in case of bottlenecks. For this reason, there is a different symbol for the "flexitime" absence than for all other full-day absences where the reason cannot be identified. Emergency services The emergency service is also determined by an employee's absence. The overview then checks whether the employee has an emergency service on the first Monday shown and displays this in red under the employee name in the list. The emergency services are always valid per week in the usual cases. Receipts posted In order to display the documents that were used to represent the workload, you can use the toolbar or by right-clicking and then using the context menu entry"Capacity overview" to jump to a list of booked vouchers divided by calendar weeks. The planned capacity can be entered in the capacity planning module, which can be accessed via the resources (Menu in search list "Edit - Set - Capacity planning". It can also be set via the list of the capacity overview by double-clicking. The evaluation and display can be influenced via the option window. Restriction criteria Resource In the area "Resource" you can set for which type of resource an evaluation should be made. The following resource types are available: Production area Workplace Working Group Machine Employees Depending on the selected resource category, a restriction option appears in the embedded subgroup "Selected resource" to start the evaluation for only one resource or only one production area which in turn can contain several resources. It is also possible to drag and drop resources into the list. However, if there are several entries, the option "Empty list before new search" in the option window must be deactivated first. Evaluation options There are two other ways to generate the evaluation: by the day or by the week. However, this option is only possible for employees and work groups. List view The list can be displayed in various ways: Quick overview - coloured boxes are displayed for a quick overview of whether there is sufficient capacity for the booked requirements Detailed - No coloured boxes were used. In this mode all relevant data is displayed divided into columns, e.g. total demand, overhang, projected demand Shift plan - The shift plan is a short overview that also shows for which customer the planned capacity is needed, or for which customer the employee was scheduled. This is determined exclusively from booked service provider groups from quotations and orders. This way it is possible to clearly identify for each employee in a given period of time if and where he is scheduled to work or where he is currently located. - Attention: In order not to make the list too confusing, only the first 50 letters of all locations are displayed per day or per week per resource! So if an employee is at 6 different customers on one day, the exact location can only be determined via the capacity overview ( in the toolbar or by double clicking on the line)! Exemplary example of a deployment plan: {img type="fileId" fileId="374" thumb="box" width="100%"} Attention during employee evaluations: If the evaluation option "Employee Graphic Mode" is set, the evaluation logic behaves a little differently than in normal mode: In the list, only the days that have LESS workload than originally planned appear in red. For all other resources it is exactly the other way round, there the overplanning is marked in red. If no capacity has been specified for a booked period, or if an absence has been booked for the employee for this day (illness, holiday, etc.), the blue box is displayed. If the employee has a "flexitime day" absence, a white square is displayed in the blue box. Also in the graphics a difference can be seen: In red, the working time is marked that was actually assigned by the daily working time assigned to the employee, but not logged off by hourly data entry. This time is therefore unlogged working time. In white, the bar shows the time that was logged off by a time sheet, but the project hanging on the time sheet has the "do not calculate" check mark. This time is considered as working time that cannot be calculated further. In blue, the time is shown in the bar, which has been logged off by time sheets and can also be charged to the customer. Display A time range for the evaluation can be specified in the right group. A possible entry would be 25th week 06 to 30th week 06 or May to June or even 2005 to 2006. The longer the selected time period, the longer the evaluation will take, of course, but the more accurate the development can be, the more accurate the resources can be graphically displayed. Once all the details have been entered, you can click on the button or by pressing Enter in the date field the evaluation can be started. The progress is indicated by a progress bar at the bottom of the screen. When the determination is complete, the result is displayed as shown above: It is now very easy to see in which workstation the workload in which calendar week is greater than planned. The planned workload is calculated by multiplying the number of employees assigned to this workstation by their weekly hours. So if a red square is visible, either the schedule would have to be rescheduled, the employees would have to be asked to work overtime or an external worker would have to be called in for this week in order to increase the planned capacity. The workloads can also be displayed in a graph for individual resources (mark entry in list). For this purpose, the toolbar button to operate. Depending on the display graphics set in the option window, a window with a bar or line chart, flat or in 3D, appears: Here it can be read even more precisely how far a planned capacity has been exceeded or whether the utilisation rate for a resource is permanently lower than planned. In this case, the planned capacity could be reduced by reassigning an employee to a different work area and at the same time the planned capacity could be increased in his new work area. With the help of the graphics, a load overview can also be created retrospectively for a whole year. Overhangs If work from previous periods is still open, this is referred to as overhangs. These overhangs are listed separately as standard. In order to see which documents make up the total of the overhangs, the entry can be marked in the list and the context menu opened by right-clicking on it. In this context menu, select the entry "Display open documents of previous periods". The worklist opens and displays all these documents. From here the documents can then be logged off. If old documents are still found, they can also be simply set to completed by clicking on "Change status" (right click on worklist). Configured times from network plan.

This is the description of the module "machine" with the name "Machine": Machines are treated in the ClassiX® system as a special manifestation of parts, i.e. according to the linguistic usage of object orientation, one also says that machines are derived from parts, machines are inherited from parts. The same applies to industrial plants, which are also derived from parts. Machines are thus individually identifiable larger units used as plants. In contrast, tools are defined as part roles in the ClassiX® system, just as plants are defined as part roles in ClassiX®. Machines have a manufacturer, are assigned to a workplace and incur costs. In operation, they can have standard set-up and piece times, they require tools and have a direct connection to the plant master. For preventive maintenance, work plans can be assigned to the machines as maintenance plans. Based on these maintenance plans, maintenance orders (in the form of production orders) are created. All work created for a maintenance plan is recorded in the maintenance account of the machine. By means of the start date, the periodicity and the last work carried out, the system can then automatically determine in the maintenance module which maintenance orders are due next. This is the description of the functionality of the module "machine" with the name "Machine" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain machines.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "corporat" with the name "Company modules" regarding Description: This module is used to maintain company data. A company is mainly described by its master data, such as name, commercial register and tax numbers, and its address(es). User-specific data of a company is stored and maintained in role objects such as customer, supplier, manufacturer, operator, etc. Any number of different roles can be assigned to a company. The master data of a company represents the basic information that is known in all roles. Linking different (property) role objects to a company object thus ensures that no redundant data can arise. A company can generally be understood as a company location. A company location basically has only one postal street address, which can, however, be recorded several times (as a so-called sub-address) in order to locate various buildings, entrances (gates), etc. at this location more precisely (by means of a corresponding address supplement). The employees working at a location are assigned to this company location with their telephone numbers, etc. and can additionally be assigned to a specific place of employment at this location (one of the main or sub addresses of the location). Within a company location, areas can be assigned to a company. Areas are to be understood as "locations within the location" in order to be able to better manage the allocation of employees, sub-addresses, especially for very large companies or institutions such as public authorities (division into departments), hospitals (division into wards) or universities (division into departments and therein again into institutes). The information content of areas basically corresponds to the information content of a company location, therefore company locations can be converted into areas of other company locations (and vice versa). Areas can be structured in any depth and can be recognised by the symbol . The areas of a company are maintained here. (Postal) different locations of one and the same "legally registered" company are called branches. A "head office" cannot be a branch of another head office at the same time, this mapping is only single-level. "Head offices" are marked in list views with the symbol , "Branches" with the symbol . If a company is assigned a "head office", this company is automatically registered internally as a "branch". This registration is reversible. One effect of the relationship of companies as branch and head office is, for example, that one cannot give a person the role as "contact person" of one's own company (client) or one of its branches. It is only possible to give such persons the role of "employee" (see place of employment). The relationship between "head office" and "branches" of a company are maintained here. In addition, companies that are legally different from each other can be linked to each other on a pro rata basis. For this purpose, companies can be assigned to parent companies as affiliated companies. If a company is assigned to a group of companies, this company is shown in list views with the symbol marked. The information on affiliated companies is maintained here. This is the description of the functionality of the module "corporat" with the name "Company modules" regarding Input window: All menu items are still locked if a new company is entered. The input mask for entering a new company address is called up via the Company module (command Insert Company under Edit). The various company-specific communication data (address, telephone, fax, e-mail, Internet), bank details, contact persons, branch offices, etc. are entered here. Any number of communication data, bank details, contact persons, branches and search terms can be assigned to a company. This is the description of the functionality of the module "corporat" with the name "Company modules" regarding Company Internet Wizard: In this window, the data of a company can be automatically entered or compared with the data found on the Internet (home page or imprint).

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocpurch" with the name "Business processes - Purchasing" regarding General overview of the shopping area: {img type="fileId" fileId="195" thumb="box" width="100%"} The purchasing area is characterised not only by the procurement itself, but also by preceding and subsequent processes. Thus, a demand fulfilment is usually based on a demand that may have arisen through the most diverse types. These include the customer requirement (order item, production parts list, gozo item), as well as the requirement of a cost centre. Through the B&B list, requirements of stock parts (quantity shortfall) and/or of dispositive purchase parts (deadline control) can be uncovered. Other requirements can of course also be recorded. The next step is the requirement request, the precursor of the order. Rules can be established here under which the requirement coverage requests must pass through an approval cycle. Now the actual purchasing department comes into play, which creates the order according to the request data (part, quantity, delivery date) and the information from the order role of the part and the supplier agreements (delivery time, price, conditions, ). If information is not sufficiently available, the buyer can also make a request to the supplier. He is supported by the possibility of comparing prices. If a framework order exists with the supplier, the buyer can also use the release order. The documents following in the document history only affect the purchase order in so far as they have an influence on the status of the order. For example, a purchase order is only reported as complete when goods receipt or direct delivery documents have been created for the entire order quantity. The incoming invoice therefore has a corresponding influence on the billing status of the purchase order. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocpurch" with the name "Business processes - Purchasing" regarding Order of services: Ordered services are reported ready by checking the box "No (further) goods receipt expected" in the group "Process control" on the delivery schedule of the follow-up order, as there should be no goods receipt for this. Exceptions are orders for services in the case of external work sequences, i.e. if provisions are sent to the supplier with which, for example, the surface treatment is stated on the order as a unit of performance. Here it is perfectly legitimate to generate a goods receipt and even a QA for the unit of performance, since the performance can also be checked directly. If, for example, 3 out of 10 parts to be galvanised are not completely galvanised, a return document can be generated and thus a subsequent claim for this service. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocpurch" with the name "Business processes - Purchasing" regarding Approval procedure: By means of the settings in the client and in the cost centres (organisation chart), the approval procedure of the requirement requests (BA), the purchase orders and/or the incoming invoices can be activated and a control system can be set up. In addition to the control system, it is also possible (depending on the settings) to define an approver manually. General definitions and rules Authorisation procedure for requisitions The approval procedure begins to take effect already during the creation of the requisition by the automatic/manual setting of the approver, but it actively influences the purchasing process but only after the requisition has been posted. If an approver was determined/set at the time of posting, the BA is not automatically released and no purchase order can be generated for the items. The BA is now checked manually. On the one hand, the approver can see via his processes which BAs he has to check, on the other hand, the purchasing department can check via the BA status list which BAs still have to be checked to make sure that no BAs are left hanging. From both lists, the module for releasing/rejecting the BA(see here) can be called. If the BA has been approved, the purchasing department can now generate the order(s) using the tools at its disposal. However, to ensure that rejected requisitions are not lost, as the need is likely to still exist, the process is not yet complete here. In the case of rejection, the requirement coverage request is returned to the processor and is available for postprocessing or post-maintenance. The requirement coverage request must then be posted again (activated) and appears for resubmission to the approver. Acceptance of the rejection should be indicated by the cancellation of the requirement coverage request by its processor. Approval procedure for orders The approval procedure for orders is similar to that for requisitions. Thus, the rules defined in the client and in the cost centres are also applied here. The only difference is that order items that have already been preceded by a requirement request no longer need to be approved. Unapproved orders cannot be printed or otherwise output. Using the list window of the orders, the purchasing department can check whether orders in the status "to be approved" get stuck and follow up with the approver. Since non-approved orders cannot be printed and are therefore not automatically printed directly, mass printing takes into account the newly approved but not yet printed orders. Approval procedure for incoming invoices The approval procedure for incoming invoices is also similar to that for requisitions and orders. Thus, the rules defined in the client and in the cost centres are also applied here. The following special features are applied in the approval procedure for incoming invoices: An incoming invoice is not released if it has not been approved. In addition, an A/P invoice is not presented to the approver until it has been verified. Approval and verification are two different processes, which are usually also carried out by different employees. During the check, the correctness of the incoming invoice is checked by the person in charge (buyer, requester, etc.). The incoming invoice is then approved by the cost centre manager.

For this purpose, the corresponding documents can be filtered using various selection criteria. In addition to the filtered documents, the list also shows the initial account assignment belonging to each invoice/credit note. Thus the outgoing invoice book can also be used for control and evaluation. The outgoing invoices and credit notes are listed sorted according to the document number. If the client's outgoing invoices and credit notes are divided into individual domains, then the ones from the registered domain are displayed first, but you can switch to other domains or display the invoices or credit notes from all domains. This is the description of the functionality of the module "sinvbook" with the name "Outgoing invoice book" regarding Manual account assignment: An invoice can be manually assigned to an account after it has been registered but not yet posted to financial accounting. When registering, a preliminary account assignment is already made automatically if this has been set above the client. A distinction can be made between simple and detailed account assignment. If it is still necessary to adjust the account assignment manually, the functionality of this module can be used. The manual account assignment can also be used if the invoice cannot be preassigned due to an undefined account assignment rule.

This is the description of the module "cxIntermediateStocking" with the name "Interim Storage": This module is used to record intermediate storage. Intermediate storage is necessary if a commodity ordered from a supplier is to be sent by direct delivery to a packaging company and from there to the customer. In this example, instead of the direct delivery document on the purchase order, an intermediate storage document is created on which the packer's warehouse is then specified. As a result, the goods are temporarily in the packer's external warehouse (interim storage document acts like a goods receipt). Since it must still be possible to allocate the value of the goods to the company's assets until delivery to the customer, this warehouse stock is also listed in the warehouse statistics. Likewise, in the warehouse account of the part, the warehouse stocks at the possibly different packer companies where the goods are temporarily stored can be viewed. The goods that are temporarily stored via an intermediate storage document are not freely available because they were ordered directly for an order item. For this reason, the goods are also directly marked as reserved in the warehouse account (quantity on hold). So that it is still possible to recognise which requirement reserves this reserved quantity, the interim storage document is displayed in the MRP account via a normal delivery note until its complete delivery. Attention! If the intermediate storage is not available, the intermediate storage document is also NOT registered in the MRP account! Only the total stock of the storage part is counted up (total.quantity), but not the available stock (current.quantity). This also does not increase the quantity put back! However, the stock movements can be seen in the stock statistics. It is advisable to mark the supplier's warehouses as "not available for planning" so that it is not assumed that there is a stock in the company which does not exist. In conjunction with an intermediate storage document, the delivery note acts like a goods withdrawal document. It is also listed in the warehouse statistics. The valuation of these goods is, in contrast to the normal warehouse valuation, not based on the average price, but directly on the standard price of the order part. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxIntermediateStocking" with the name "Interim Storage" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain interim storage documents. For a more detailed description click here. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxIntermediateStocking" with the name "Interim Storage" regarding List window: This window is used to list intermediate storage.

The "standard information" on the procurement type and time from the master information of the parts master is used as the basis. Steps 3 and 4 (planning) may have to be carried out iteratively several times after manually changing the disposition type and/or procurement time of individual parts so that the planned dates can be met. This planning can also be carried out graphically supported by means of a Gantt chart. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. What is the purpose of the "cxItemDemand" module in SAP?
2. How does the "cxItemDemand" module automate parts planning in SAP?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding Post Calculation: In order to determine which costs have actually been incurred on a cost object (e.g. sales order), all costs ? its follow-on documents must be added up. These are, for example, goods withdrawal slips, BDE deregistrations, incoming invoices etc. Some parts that are required but not planned have no follow-on documents, but must of course still be debited to the sales order. This is done for these parts using the standard quantity specified in the parts list. Only when the parts requisition is released (traffic light on green), all costs of the non-planned parts are allocated to the cost units via the final costing. All further costs arise automatically with the posting of the follow-up document. Disposition types The following disposition types are available for disposition from the parts request: Explanation of the general term "Kanban Kanban is Japanese and means something like "card". It is a practical system of warehouse management in which a card is placed in each box in which parts are managed in the warehouse, under all parts at the bottom of the box. When the box is empty, the card becomes visible. Now the employee who has taken the last part out of the box must take the card and give it to the buyer indicated on the card. Depending on the replacement time of the part, there must then be 2 or more boxes of this part. Every time a box is empty, a new one is ordered. In the time in which the box is ordered but has not yet arrived or is being produced, the remaining boxes are used. 1. determination of the disposition type of the parts Based on the standard logistic identification of a part (in-house production, purchased or externally produced part) and its provision identification (disposable part, stock part, etc.), the type of disposition is automatically determined for each part in the Gozintograph. Thus, for example, non-stock-managed in-house production parts are set to the disposition type "production order", non-stock-managed purchased parts to the disposition type "requirement request" and stock parts to the disposition type "material withdrawal". Material staging indicators such as manual storage part are parts that actually have the MRP type "material withdrawal". However, since such parts are not taken from the warehouse on an order-related basis using material withdrawal slips, and are therefore not "processed", such parts are set to the MRP type "No MRP". Another irregularity is the "special material withdrawal". If a part requisition item is set to special material withdrawal, this requirement does not appear in the MRP account, but the item still has the status warehouse reservation - and can therefore be found via the staging list. These items must also be staged here, but no goods withdrawal documents are created. These parts also appear in the production documents as being to be taken from the warehouse. The determination of the disposition type can either be influenced automatically by separate control systems or changed manually. If, for example, a purchased part that is not normally kept in stock should have a stock (e.g. due to a return delivery from a previous order), the system automatically changes the disposition type from "requirement request" to"material surplus ". The same applies to a production part in stock that may have been "left over" from a previous order. The parts can then be taken directly from the warehouse. Parts requisitions marked with this MRP type appear in the staging list under "Stock reservation". The disposition type defined in a gozintograph - automatically or manually - can therefore be quite different from the "standard" procurement type. The "standard" procurement type determines the generally valid case and is (should) not (be) changed (modified) for specific orders. A gozintograph is used to completely record the fully resolved parts lists of all parts. If a part is located below or within an assembly whose MRP type is "requirement request" or "material withdrawal", then this part or its quantity share - together with all parts of its bill of material - need not be considered further for MRP, as it is already contained in its superior assembly. For such parts, the MRP type is set to "not required". Conversely, if the MRP type of the superior assembly is changed to "production order" (if it is also an in-house produced part), the subordinate parts are automatically taken into account again in the MRP - the quantities (parts) become visible again. The MRP type"No MRP" thus refers to parts that are definitely needed or must be used, but should not be planned. The MRP type"not required", on the other hand, refers to parts that do appear in the combined bill of material but whose superior part is not to be produced (the superior part does not have the MRP type "production order"). The determined or manually defined disposition type is displayed in the column "Disposition". In the next column - if necessary - notes are displayed whether the disposition type could cause problems in the following processing stages. If the check fails, a red warning point is displayed: 2. determination of the standard procurement time according to the disposition type The standard procurement time or also replenishment lead time is taken from the production role for the MRP type "production order" and from the order article role of the part for the MRP type "requirement request". For production parts this is the pure procurement time of the corresponding level (total lead time of the routing only for this production part, not for its assemblies). It is therefore not the total "delivery time" of the part. For parts kept in stock (material withdrawals) a duration of 1 day is entered as standard. In addition to the standard procurement time, it is also possible to have the procurement time determined dynamically. This dynamic determination only affects parts that have received the disposition type "production order". Here it is now checked whether a routing has already been exploded on the possibly already attached production order. If so, the total time of the exploded routing is saved as the lead time for the parts request item. If a routing does not yet exist for the production order, or if no production order has yet been created at all, the total time of the master routing is saved as the lead time for the parts request item. 3. scheduling of the necessary provision of parts Due to the sequence of the production stages and the procurement times of the individual parts, there is a scheduling network of the parts among themselves (order network), which is best represented in the form of a Gantt diagram. In forward scheduling, this collective order starts on a predefined date (the default value is the day of planning itself). In backward scheduling, the delivery date (or the staging date, if available) is used as the starting point. It is not possible to schedule into the past, i.e. even with backward scheduling the delivery or staging date can be postponed to a later date than desired. (A corresponding warning message is automatically issued by the system, the system then automatically schedules forwards!)

10. Describe the process of releasing a parts requirement and linking it with ex ante requirements.

Please let me know if you'd like me to reformulate any of these questions or provide additional details.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding Post Calculation: An influence on the delivery or provision date can be achieved by changing (shortening or extending) the procurement time: this results in an extension or shortening of the entire order network. The starting point of scheduling - e.g. the delivery or provision date in the case of backward scheduling - is first transferred to the collective order as the"latest finish date". If you subtract the procurement time from such a "latest end date", you get a"latest start date". The different lengths of the procurement times within a production stage result in"earliest start dates" for individual parts, which can be earlier than the latest start date. Adding the procurement time to the earliest start date then results in an"earliest finish date" again. In automatic scheduling over a period of time (e.g. "3rd week 2014"), the last working day of the period is set as the latest end in backward scheduling. This results in the latest start. Subsequently, the earliest start is determined from the latest start by deducting the duration of the period and the earliest end is determined on the basis of this. Excursus: The production orders are transferred to capacity planning with their respective earliest and latest completion dates . Automatic (non-graphical) forward scheduling: See the Automatic Terminationsection See also operating calendar and buffer times In the case of requirements from part requirements (departure date), the planned date is made up of the earliest and latest start, which also results in a time span. With the evaluation type "Strict", the earliest date of this time span is always used for the evaluation, with the setting "Medium" exactly the middle and with "Soft" the end of the time span, i.e. there is the least buffer for the real requirement. If planning (e.g. stock replenishment) is always to be carried out with a little air, the setting "Medium" is recommended, which is always set in the standard system. However, if there is little space in the warehouse or if the warehouse budget is always to be kept as low as possible, the setting "Soft" is recommended, whereby planning is always carried out on the actual demand date. Strictly means, therefore, that the goods are always already procured at the earliest possible date and may also lie in the warehouse for some time until they are needed, depending on how large the buffer times of the requirements were. 4. checking the availability of materials Checking material availability on the basis of the earliest or latest date in the parts request. This can be moved forward (with -) or backward by days or weeks. This shift is not calculated in calendar days but in working days, i.e. holidays and weekends are not included. During the check, the subsequent part requirements are normally also taken into account, i.e. parts that are available for the order are also displayed, but are in the red due to other orders. If you select the checkbox "Ignore later requirements", these subsequent part requirements will not be considered! On the one hand, it is possible to check the availability of stocked material on the desired date by checking the respective MRP account. The entries with the unavailable material are displayed selected in the list. On the other hand, material overhangs can be checked: If a part is by default a purchase or production part, but remaining stock (material surplus) from previous orders is still available, these entries of the list are also displayed selected for further checking. As a reaction, the MRP type can be changed, for example, from requirement request to material withdrawal, whereby this part is no longer procured via purchasing, but is instead withdrawn from existing (surplus) stock. These checks can also be graphically supported by means of a Gantt chart. 5. triggering of production orders, purchase requisitions and stock reservations Once the disposition types and dates for all parts have been defined within the gozintograph, the further documents such as production orders, purchase requisitions and stock reservations can be created automatically. 6. release of the parts requirement The release of the parts request blocks it from subsequent modification. A. Link with ex ante requirements If a sales order item is planned and preliminary requirements have been created for it, the following query appears, for example If you press "YES", it means that a remaining quantity still reserved over advance requirements will be withdrawn from this specific sales order, put into stock and thus released for general free disposal. If you press "NO" it means that you still want a remaining reserved quantity to remain available for this sales order and its further future dispositions. In case of doubt, you should therefore answer "NO" here, i.e. leave the reserved quantities with this sales order. B. Change in quantity Double-clicking on the part request item opens the individual disposition. Among other things, the quantity of the part requirement item can be changed there. For this purpose the editing field must be activated with the button next to the quantity specification. The quantity change is also carried out in the exploded parts list (predecessor of the parts requirement item) when saving the individual planning run. If the part requirement item has several predecessors, the system tries to distribute the quantity to all predecessors. This can result in the quantity of a BOM item being set to 0 or being greatly increased. If it is not possible to split the new quantity, a corresponding error message is issued and the quantity change is not saved. C. Deletion of direct follow-on documents(production order, requirement request, warehouse reservation) When deleting direct follow-on documents, the respective identifiers within the part request must be deleted, otherwise direct follow-on documents can no longer be created for the affected items. To remove the identifier, there is the menu item Delete in the parts request under Edit. The various identifiers can be removed with the submenu items below.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding Main window: In this window, a parts request (gozintograph) is processed that has arisen from the production parts lists summarised according to production stages within the framework of parts scheduling. The type of display and further processing of the parts request can be controlled via the options. In the main menu the activities related to the whole part request are summarised, functionality related to single selected lines of the part request can be reached by using the buttons or the context menu (right mouse button on a line). Double-clicking on a list entry brings up the maintenance window for a single list entry, an individual scheduling. The column "Work plan" is used for a quick overview of whether there is anything to be considered regarding the work plans for production parts: If neither of the two cases applies to the parts requirement item, the column remains empty. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding Option window: Each time the part request window is opened, the options described here are reset to the default settings. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding Individual disposition: In this window a single entry of the entire part request is edited. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding Dispatching structure: In this view, for a part selected in the list view of the part request, the entire, dispositive structure of the (sub-)parts actually required for this part is displayed. As it is only known after the disposition which parts are actually required, this disposition structure can only be called up after the disposition. Optionally, you can only choose whether you want to display the parts "without MRP". Displayed are the part number, the description, the required quantity, the type of disposition and - in case of multiple use - also the number of parts in which the respective part is used. By double-clicking on an entry within the tree, you can go directly to the corresponding entry in the list view, where you can then also view any multiple use (in the higher-level parts). (If parts are not displayed in the list view, please check the display options). This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding Cancellation of part requests: By cancelling a requirement trigger document (warehouse order, sales order, advance requirement), the parts requirement must also be cancelled so that the requirement no longer appears in the MRP account. When a part request is cancelled, all successors in the part request are also cancelled, e.g. in the case of production orders, all items belonging to them are cancelled. The following rules apply to cancellations, which are shown here schematically:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding Calculation of the remaining quantity in the case of shortfalls in completed storage contracts: If a storage order item is marked as finished before the complete quantity has been put away, the remaining quantities are written into the slot cancelled.quantity, the status of the storage order item goes to "put away". To end a warehouse order item early, a partial quantity must be created via a posted goods receipt. Here, on the one hand, there is the possibility of reporting the warehouse order as finished with a short quantity by ticking "Cancel remaining quantity", on the other hand, there is the possibility of doing the same in the warehouse order item itself via the traffic light. If a partial quantity for a stock order item has been placed into storage and the traffic light is then changed from green to red, the stock order item is not stopped or cancelled, but marked as finished. In both cases, the system branches to a cancellation document. Only after posting this cancellation document is the remaining quantity cancelled and the order status changed to completed or cancelled. Also all Gozinto positions are adjusted and the remaining quantity is written into the slot cancelled.quantity. If several BOMs have been combined when creating the gozintograph, whereby only one BOM item is to be stopped, cancelled or reported finished, then the quantity of the item to be cancelled must be determined proportionately. The following graphic is helpful for this:. 
Sure! Based on the given description of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)", I can provide some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask:

1. What is the purpose of the "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" module in SAP?
2. How do I process a parts request (gozintograph) in the "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" module?
3. Can I control the type of display and further processing of the parts request in the "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" module?
4. How do I access the activities related to the whole part request in the "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" module?
5. What is the function of the "Work plan" column in the "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" module?
6. How do I edit a single entry of the entire part request in the "Individual disposition" window of the "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" module?
7. Can I display the dispositive structure of the (sub-)parts actually required for a part in the "Dispatching structure" view of the "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" module?
8. How do I cancel a requirement trigger document (warehouse order, sales order, advance requirement) in the "Cancellation of part requests" section of the "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" module?
9. What happens to the successors in a part request when I cancel the requirement trigger document?
10. How does the "Calculation of the remaining quantity in the case of shortfalls in completed storage contracts" feature in the "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" module work?

I hope these questions cover most of the functionalities of the "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" module in SAP!

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding Subsequent conversion of the disposition type: If, for example, a part originally planned as an order part is to be converted to a production order after the parts requisition has been released, existing production orders, material withdrawals and purchase requisitions may change. For this reason, the conversion of a scheduled parts request item is not quite simple. First of all, it should be checked whether existing parts request items are changed/added by the changeover. This is done via the context menu of the list. - The entry to be changed over is marked in the parts request and the context menu is opened with the right mouse button. - A result window appears, which contains all newly added or existing changing parts request items. It shows the original and the newly determined quantity, as well as the statuses before and after the simulated changeover. In this way, it is possible to check in advance which further changes are to be expected: The tested position previously selected in the list appears as the topmost position as the entry object. If a previously "sleeping" part request item (old status "Not required") is now required,"New part request item" appears in the first column on the left. If the part requisition item already existed,"Changed part requisition item" appears here. If no existing parts requisition items with an MRP type material withdrawal, purchase requisition or production order have been changed, the item can be converted without hesitation. So in the example above you don't see any critical changes either, the only changed parts requirement items were and are set to "No disposition". The box"Hide unneeded" controls whether or not the "sleeping" part request positions that are not needed even after the simulated changeover are also displayed. However, if parts request items that have already been processed are changed, further quantity changes are necessary. This may require contacting the schedulers of existing purchase requisitions in order to adjust the quantity to be ordered and to coordinate the quantities and dates with the supplier. For production orders, existing production papers must be collected and reprinted. These scenarios are not yet implemented in ClassiX®, the changeover is aborted by an error message. - More about this later If the disposition type is changed now, exactly the part requirements are created which were previously already visible in the preview window. At present, only a subsequent change from purchase requisition to production order is supported. Now, the new parts request items have not yet been scheduled, which must be done manually via graphic scheduling. Before that, the lead times of the new parts request items should be reset. This is currently done automatically when switching the disposition type. If the final dates are correct again after the adjustment, the project is updated via the menu "Edit"-"Update project" and the dates are written back. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. How do I convert a scheduled parts request item to a production order in ClassiX?
2. What happens to existing production orders, material withdrawals, and purchase requisitions when converting a scheduled parts request item to a production order in ClassiX?
3. Can I simulate a changeover in ClassiX before actually making the conversion to a production order? If so, how do I access the simulation feature?
4. Will existing parts request items be changed or added when converting a scheduled parts request item to a production order in ClassiX? How can I view these changes?
5. Is there a way to hide "sleeping" part request positions that are not needed even after the simulated changeover in ClassiX?
6. What happens to the lead times of new parts request items when converting a scheduled parts request item to a production order in ClassiX? Do they need to be reset manually?
7. After converting a scheduled parts request item to a production order in ClassiX, how do I update the project dates to reflect the changes made during the conversion process?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding Overhangs and splitting: If a quantity of a standard MRP part is still available in a warehouse because, for example, the requirement of an original requirement trigger has been reduced or cancelled completely, this warehouse quantity (the so-called overhang quantity, see also " Check material overhangs" in the Gantt chart for part requirements) should be used up as quickly as possible. Overhangs can also occur when a part that was initially in stock is converted to "dispositive": any quantities still in stock at this time are then also treated as overhangs by the system. ClassiX® offers the functionality to consider surplus quantities already when creating the gozintograph. For this purpose, an option "Automatically consume surplus quantities" is available in all option windows for creating a gozintograph. If this option is set, an additional - initially still unposted - stock reallocation document is immediately created for each recognised surplus quantity when the MRP type is determined. This document serves as an identifier for the reservation of the surplus quantity for the order(s) processed in the gozintograph. The stock quantity is not actually reserved for the processed order(s) until the stock reset document is posted. This booking is triggered either manually by the user or by further processing of the gozintograph (e.g. by executing "Create first purchase requisition" in the case of excess quantities of purchase requisitions). The booking fails if another user has already used these surplus quantities while processing the gozintograph. If an excess quantity is recognised and booked for a production order, all - secondary - part requirements subordinate to this production order are automatically reduced by the corresponding quantity. If, for example, 1000 screws are needed for a production order of 100 pieces, but 20 pieces are withdrawn from stock as surplus quantity, the withdrawal quantity of the screws is automatically reduced to 800 pieces. The quantity of screws that is now no longer required (200 pieces) is marked as a cancelled quantity in the parts requisition item of the screws (during final posting, see above). If excess quantities are taken into account for parts requisition items (production order or purchase requisition), this has no effect on the scheduling (e.g. in the Gantt chart) of the corresponding parts requisition items: it is assumed that the respective excess quantity is available "immediately", the lead time of the parts requisition item is only based on the "main MRP", i.e. the lead time of the production or order part. This splitting (of parts dispositions) can not only take place automatically in the case of surplus quantities, but can also be triggered manually in the gozintograph via the menu selection "secondary disposition". For example, in the event of bottlenecks in production, a partial quantity can be ordered or, conversely, in the event of a supplier's delivery bottlenecks, a partial quantity can be produced by the supplier. In the latter case, however - due to secondary dispositions - the main disposition must be the production order, with the purchase requisition as secondary disposition. Which additional disposition can I create for which main disposition? To illustrate this, the following table: This table shows all types of ancillary planning. A few examples and an explanation are provided for clarification: In the left column you can read which main disposition type is on the part request item. In the columns to the right you can read off in the respective line which secondary MRP type can be created. It becomes clear that no auxiliary MRP "production order" can be created for any main MRP, only a purchase requisition and/or a stock reserve document can be created as auxiliary MRP. Since - as already explained above - the scheduling of a stock return document is irrelevant, only the secondary dispositions that are purchase requisitions (replenishment lead times) need to be taken into account additionally when scheduling a collective order. As can be seen from the table above, this only applies to the main disposition "production order" and "material withdrawal":. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. Can I use the "Automatically consume surplus quantities" feature to reduce the amount of stock held for a particular part?
2. How do I identify which parts have surplus quantities that can be consumed?
3. What happens if two users attempt to book the same surplus quantity simultaneously?
4. Can I adjust the lead time for a part requirement if there is a surplus quantity available?
5. How does the system determine which parts require secondary dispositions, such as purchasing or producing?
6. Can I create multiple secondary dispositions for a single main disposition?
7. Is it possible to prioritize one secondary disposition over another if they are both relevant to the same main disposition?
8. How does the system handle situations where there are insufficient funds or materials to fulfill all of the requested secondary dispositions?
9. Can I view reports or dashboards to monitor the usage of surplus quantities and the impact on my supply chain?
10. Are there any limitations or restrictions on using the "Automatically consume surplus quantities" feature, such as minimum or maximum order sizes?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding Rescheduling: See also calendar of operations A parts request that has already been started can be rescheduled in the same way as a parts request that has not yet been started. Please note that before any change is made, the approval of the parts request must be cancelled (set the traffic light to red)! To do this, select from the menu "Edit - Scheduling - Graphic - Rescheduling" or "Edit - Scheduling - Graphic - Backward / forward scheduling" and reschedule the part request. After scheduling, all follow-on documents that may exist for the individual part request items must be checked to see if the dates still fit, because during rescheduling, the dates of the follow-on documents (production order / requirement request) are not automatically adjusted. In order to know which parts requirement items have changed after rescheduling, a list is opened after "Update project" in the graphical scheduling, which shows all changed parts requirement items. This window can also be opened again at any time after closing it via the menu item"Edit - Check - Changed dates". If the dates are now to be transferred to the subsequent documents, select the respective entry from the list and open the context menu with the right mouse button. Here there is the entry "Copy appointments to follow-on documents". The latest end of the part request item is taken over as date for the follow-on documents. Please note that the work sequences are only adjusted to the end date (the work sequences are postponed by the same number of working days as the end date of the part request has been postponed)! If the duration of a production order has been changed via graphic scheduling, the routing is not automatically extended as well! This must be done manually afterwards! (The system cannot know which work sequence now takes longer or which work sequence has been added!) Material withdrawals whose dates have changed are ignored when the list of changed dates is reopened. Material withdrawals do not have a follow-on document and therefore do not need to be handled separately. When this list is opened automatically for the first time, directly after rescheduling from the graphical view, these material withdrawals appear additionally in the list, since at this point in time all changed part requisition dates are generally displayed here. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding Changing the processing time: With this dialogue it is possible to increase the total cycle time for the gozintograph and to distribute this as a percentage to the cycle times of the parts on the individual positions of the gozintograph. However, the lead times of individual work sequences of the production orders do not change, only the earliest start date and finish date are changed. This gives the individual cost centres/workstations more time to process the order and can thus avoid peaks. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding Self-provision: If, for example, a "brick lining" service is ordered from a supplier, in which this supplier is to install something in a finished assembly (brick lining), the assembly must be built to schedule before the brick lining is ordered. So from the parts list it must look like this: Order part "brick lining" has the following parts list entries in its production role: Sub-assembly A must be provided to the supplier in order to enable the supplier to perform the ordered service. Sub-assembly B is provided by the supplier himself. In the parts request, there is therefore the brick lining with the procurement type "purchase requisition". Now, however, a production order must be created below this purchase requisition so that the assembly is executed before the brickwork is ordered: There are two ways to do this: For information on the further course of the self-provision, see here. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding List window: Serves to list or search for part requirements (Gozintographs). All transaction types that exist in the ClassiX® system can be dragged into the list with the mouse. If there is a follow-up parts requisition for the item dragged into the list, or for one of its sub-items, these are displayed in the list. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select part requests (Gozintographs). 
Sure, I'd be happy to assist! Based on the given module description, here are some potential questions that an unfamiliar user might ask:

1. Can I reschedule a parts request that has already been started using the "Edit - Scheduling - Graphic - Rescheduling" function?
2. How do I check which parts requirement items have changed after rescheduling using the "Edit - Check - Changed Dates" function?
3. What happens to the follow-on documents of a parts request when I reschedule the request using the "Edit - Scheduling - Graphic - Rescheduling" function? Do the dates get updated automatically?
4. Is it possible to copy appointments to follow-on documents when rescheduling a parts request using the "Edit - Scheduling - Graphic - Rescheduling" function? If so, how do I do this?
5. Can I adjust the duration of a production order through graphic scheduling, and if so, how do I do this?
6. Does changing the processing time of a gozintograph affect the lead times of individual work sequences of the production orders?
7. Can I use the "Self-provision" feature to order a "brick lining" service from a supplier, and if so, what are the steps involved in doing so?
8. How do I create a production order below a purchase requisition to execute the assembly before ordering the brickwork using the "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" module?
9. What is the purpose of the "List window" in the "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" module, and how do I use it to list or search for part requirements?
10. Can I drag different transaction types into the list with the mouse in the "List window"? And if so, what kind of transactions can I drag in?

I hope these questions cover most of the functionalities described in the module description!

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding Automatic scheduling: The automatic scheduling offers the possibility to schedule the entire part requirement either from a start date forward or from an end date backward fully automatically. This type of scheduling simulates the resulting work sequences, if they have not already been resolved, and plans them into the actual utilisation of resources to identify bottlenecks. Furthermore, in the automatic scheduling window it can be checked whether parts are/will be available on the specified date. Bottlenecks (material or capacity) are pointed out, or they are automatically bypassed by scheduling shifts. It is also possible to clear up the remaining bottlenecks later in the manual graphical scheduling. There are two possibilities to circumvent the bottlenecks, or workplace-specific holidays or insufficient capacity: The set scheduling options are saved on the part request item (seamless scheduling and avoid bottlenecks). If another work sequence is subsequently inserted into a production order, it is scheduled with the same settings as the entire parts requirement before it. Note: The operating calendars of the individual workstations or production areas are taken into account for scheduling. For example, it is possible to schedule the welding shop fully in the first calendar week of the year, with all other production areas being free at this time. After automatic scheduling, a message will appear to indicate whether the planned delivery date could be met, and information on capacity and material bottlenecks will also appear in the list in the scheduling window. More about rescheduling and the general scheduling of the necessary provision of parts. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding Required capacity: This window provides an overview of all required workstation resources in the respective calendar weeks. Even if routings or production orders have not yet been exploded, the system simulates the requirements and adds them to the actual current requirements. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemDemand" with the name "Parts requirement (Gozintograph)" regarding preConstraints-postConstraints Connections of the part requirement items to each other: The connection in a part request of the positions among each other still below (to dispose before me) and above (will be produced with me after me) is done by the connection preConstraints (before me) and postConstraints (after me). This connection makes it very easy to determine for which part requirement item a different part requirement item is needed. No need to go through the complicated BOM predecessor item. If a part requirement item is to be cancelled, all part requirement items to be scheduled before this item must also be adjusted in the correct quantity ratio (or cancelled if cancelled item is the only predecessor) - these can now be determined very easily. If a part is required at several points in the parts list across several production levels, it always appears at the lowest level in the parts request, since these are planned first (it is double-wired by postConstraints!). Example: A blower to be manufactured in-house is to be installed in a switch cabinet. M6 screws are required for both the control cabinet and the blower (they are present in both parts lists). So the parts lists look like this: Switch cabinet: blower: A total of 70 M6 screws are therefore required. In the part request, identical parts are grouped together (e.g. so that the same production order is not created 3 times for the same part). Therefore it is now necessary to procure the screws in their entire quantity at the earliest required date, i.e. at the time the fan is manufactured. The part request item appears with the highest required level and will be scheduled as early as possible. Technically, the parts requirement position of the M6 screw is now connected to 2 postConstraints, namely that of the blower and that of the control cabinet. If the blower is now cancelled via the parts list, the parts requirement position of the screws is reduced in quantity and moved directly below the level of the control cabinet.

This is the description of the module "staffmem" with the name "Employee modules": The employee module is used to maintain the operational data of your own employees. "Own" employees (CX_STAFF_MEMBER) are contact persons of the clients defined in the system, employees of all other companies (CX_CONTACT) are managed separately as "general" contact persons . As a rule, these are "own" employees of the clients defined in the system, who also have a user role in order to have access to the ClassiX system and to be able to operate it. User roles can also be assigned to contact persons of other companies. After logging in to the system, these persons will be identified as processors of the documents they process. As far as the processing of documents is concerned, they are then no longer different from their own employees. Please note the following: By default, all employees of the clients stored in the system are displayed (unless they are stored in their own database domains). To display only the employees of the logged on client, the option "Only employees of the client" can be activated in the option window. This is the description of the functionality of the module "staffmem" with the name "Employee modules" regarding Input window: This module is used to maintain employee data. You can select an employee by entering the employee number in the Number field and confirm with RETURN.

The information necessary for the company can usually be entered in the fields directly or via the menu item 'Edit'. Telephone, fax, e-mail, etc. can also be maintained by clicking the right mouse button in the field 'Business Communication'. The employees created here can also be found in the system as persons. If you want to add private data, we recommend that you do this via the list of persons. Don't forget to link the employee to the corresponding system user, if the employee should have access to the system. For the employee, you define the validity using the entry and leaving dates. Please remember, however, that the validity of the user entry is independent of this! This must be the case, for example, because you may want to block an employee's system access before he or she leaves the company or you may want to continue to grant system access after he or she has left the company. If an image is stored in the person for an employee, this is also displayed in a reduced version on the "Person" tab. If no image is stored, the message "No image" appears here.

This is the description of the module "processes_bpsalescrm" with the name "Business processes - Sales - Transaction processing": CRM (Customer Relationship Management) supports communication in the customer process with reliable figures, data and facts. The aim is to build long-term profitable customer relationships so that more sales are generated and the value of the company is increased. To ensure this, every exchange of information with the customer must be fully traceable. The CyberEnterprise® supports the CRM not only with suitable master information about customers and/or contact persons, but also with transaction processing and all other pre-formatted business documents (quotation, order, invoice, etc.). An evaluation of a customer relationship can be made via KPI monitors. Transaction processing offers the possibility to merge all communication channels of a customer. In most cases these are telephone, fax, e-mail or notes. These transaction documents are generated manually and can be stored in differently organised transaction folders. Transaction documents are assigned to different business processes and can have several defined statuses, which are controlled manually or automatically. Thus all discrete interactions with the customer can be viewed and monitored in order to optimally evaluate the information about a customer. Employees with direct customer contact are thus provided with all the relevant customer information they need, for example, when servicing or acquiring new customers. In addition to the activity documents, all pre-formatted business documents (quotation, order, invoice, etc.) are also considered as activities and are stored and posted in the activity folders of a customer or other business objects (partner, user, part, etc.). Subfolders for period, status, etc. are also automatically created. (see also transaction description).

This is the description of the module "dispobom" with the name "Disposable assembly": With this module, the complete structure of a parts list - i.e. including the structures of all subordinate assemblies - can be changed in a production part role in order to better reflect the actual manufacturing process of the part in production. In design, assemblies are often only formed from a purely functional point of view, i.e. a "constructive" product structure is created which does not correspond to the "dispositive" product structure. Such deviations between the "constructive" and "dispositive" view of a bill of material can occur when a bill of material individual items within a subordinate assembly of this parts list are not first pre-assembled to this assembly in the production process, but are built directly into the higher-level assembly in one go(constructive assembly), individual items of the same level do not flow simultaneously, but at different times into different, higher-level(MRP-extended) assemblies (e.g. in the case of subordinate, individually loose parts that must first be provided for final assembly), or individual items are only prefabricated as sub-assemblies - not provided for by the design -(purely disposable assemblies). So if an assembly is declared as a so-called"constructive assembly" on the production part, this level is completely omitted in the MRP view of each higher-level assembly of this production part. If a "dispositive assembly" is declared on the production part, then items from different, subordinate assemblies can be "shifted dispositively (up)" into this assembly, i.e. the vertical range of manufacture of these items can be reduced. Finally, by defining a"purely dispositive assembly", individual items from any structure depth of the parts list can be combined to form a new part, a new assembly. The constructive product structure of a production part, which is built up from the point of view of design, can therefore differ considerably from the production-oriented dispositive product structure of the same production part, which also changes the structure of the part requirement. The restructuring of a product structure from the constructive to the dispositive type is defined on the basis of dispositive assembly objects which are added to a production role of a part. This is the description of the functionality of the module "dispobom" with the name "Disposable assembly" regarding Input window: An MRP assembly always refers to the production part whose MRP product structure is to be changed. If the production part itself does not have its own bill of material, i.e. if it is a purely MRP assembly, a bill of material can be freely specified, otherwise the specifications for the bill of material of the production part apply. With the button the constructive, with the button the dispositive product structure can be called up. If a production roll has a bill of material and if the MRP assembly contains an entry for a part from a subordinate assembly of this bill of material, this part is "pushed" below this production part when the production bill of material is exploded (reduction of the vertical range of manufacture) - according to the new MRP product structure. This also applies to purely MRP assemblies, the only difference is that in this case the production part itself does not have a bill of material, but this is specified in the purely MRP assembly itself (reduction or increase of the vertical range of manufacture). This purely MRP entry is then visible both in the initial production role (the freely selected parts list) and in the production role of the intermediate part, the purely MRP assembly. Fields. This is the description of the functionality of the module "dispobom" with the name "Disposable assembly" regarding Available product structure: The MRP product structure shows how the bill of material is later processed in production, or how the parts are planned or installed. The dispositive product structure of the parts list is displayed as a tree. The button in the upper left corner allows you to call up the constructive product structure. The following symbols are used:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "dispobom" with the name "Disposable assembly" regarding Constructive product structure: The constructive product structure of the parts list is displayed as a tree. The button in the top left corner enables the MRP product structure to be called up (see also the symbols used there). This is the description of the functionality of the module "dispobom" with the name "Disposable assembly" regarding Disposable assemblies: This window is used to display all the MRP assemblies of a production part and all the MRP assemblies registered in the system.

This is the description of the module "cxTxnDescriptor" with the name "Transaction description": Transaction descriptions define the processing of documents. Essentially, this involves the posting of documents to accounts/monitors, but it is also possible to carry out general data operations on all objects accessible from the document. As is common practice within the CyberEnterprise business OS, conditions (subtransactions, dimensions, data) are stored as CX_FORMULA objects.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAdvanceDemand" with the name "Advance requirements - AppsWH" regarding Input window - Advance requirements header: This window is used to maintain the general data ("header data") of a preliminary requirements document. You can select a preliminary requirements document by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with ENTER. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". An advance requirement document must be assigned to a sales order or quotation; in the document history it is a follow-up document. The possibility to create the preliminary requirement with a quotation makes it possible to plan or execute time-critical orders or production orders already in the final phase of the order placement. The calculation is posted directly with the preliminary requirements document. The assignment of the costs to an order is made via the predecessor. If the predecessor is an order directly or via the order which is the successor of the quotation. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAdvanceDemand" with the name "Advance requirements - AppsWH" regarding Input window - Pre-requirement position: This window is used to maintain preliminary requirement items. If the entry in text fields is terminated with ENTER, the text cursor moves through the fields in the following order Delivery date -> Part -> Quantity -> OK button, or Provision -> OK button It does not make sense to create preliminary requirements for level 0 parts, because the correct sales order item could be created in their place. In the case of constructive assemblies, it is not the constructive assembly itself that must be created as preliminary requirements, but all its subheadings must be created individually as preliminary requirements. The constructional assembly is not a real assembly, i.e. not a final part or component, it merely represents a grouping of parts of a superior assembly which is more clearly arranged for production. Residual quantity management: If a remaining, already planned quantity of an advance requirement item is no longer to be linked, it is possible to create a goods putaway using the open quantity. There is a toolbar button for this in the preliminary requirement item . Furthermore, it is possible to charge off the remaining, not yet allocated quantity at the cost of the cost unit and thus close the advance requirement. To do this, the "Closed" checkbox must be set on the advance requirement item and then a reason for closing must be entered. This tick can only be set if no open MRP transactions created directly for this preliminary requirement (for example, a purchase order for which no goods receipt has yet been provided) are registered in the MRP account. Provided that there are still open MRP movements, these must first be closed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAdvanceDemand" with the name "Advance requirements - AppsWH" regarding List window: Used to list the advance requirement documents. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAdvanceDemand" with the name "Advance requirements - AppsWH" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select an advance requirement object. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAdvanceDemand" with the name "Advance requirements - AppsWH" regarding Option window: All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed with the "OK" button. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAdvanceDemand" with the name "Advance requirements - AppsWH" regarding Business Pattern: An advance requirement item always has, if not just a warehouse reservation, at least one follow-up line, namely the line that leads to production or to purchasing of this advance requirement item. However, if this preliminary requirement item is now also assigned to one or more requirements because these have called off the preliminary requirement or partial quantities, this preliminary requirement item has further successors, namely these calling-off requirements, which can either be parts planning items or sales order items. If, for example, one wanted to move back from the incoming invoice of a preliminary requirement item assigned to a parts MRP item to a sales order item, then one would have to A) move back from the ER to the preliminary requirement item, then down the other subsequent string to the parts MRP item, and there finally C) up the other preceding string, possibly through an exploded bill of material, to a sales order item.

This is the description of the module "capacityPlanning" with the name "Capacity planning": To be able to calculate the planned workload of an employee, workstation, machine or other resource against the available time budget, a total planned time for a period (usually calendar weeks) must be entered. Here the full working time is given without taking holidays into account, e.g. for employees with 40 hour weeks for one year 8 hours daily. Capacity planning therefore only forms the basic time frame of the employee. Absence times, such as holiday or illness, are maintained via the employee's absence times, which automatically reduces the planned capacity in this period by the employee and all assigned work groups. Employees and work groups can be planned precisely by the day, other resources only by the week. For employees, it is advisable to schedule the capacity in normal daily working hours, i.e. as a rule, 8h is entered in the Capacity field and the grid is set to "Days". The weekly working time is only extrapolated and also entered for employees on the basis of the daily capacity (8h) times the number of working days within the calendar week. An evaluation is therefore later possible both on a daily and weekly basis. The planned capacity is then saved by clicking on the "Set capacity" button. This is the description of the functionality of the module "capacityPlanning" with the name "Capacity planning" regarding General capacity planning: Planning the capacity for a resource is always done in 3 steps (please refer to the links to the different areas for more detailed explanations of the individual topics) Step 1: Set the available capacity of the resource Step 2: Planning of requirements Step 3: Overview of the planned capacity:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "capacityPlanning" with the name "Capacity planning" regarding Input window: Capacity planning is carried out in the specified period (date range) in the selected grids (calendar weeks by default). These grids should only be changed in connection with the change in the posting of work sequences, so that the working times actually posted can actually be calculated against the planned times entered. For employees, the standard grid is "days". With "Set capacity" the entered planned times within the entered time period are then written to the resources (employees, workstations, work groups) located in the list "Selected resources" below. Specificity Staff capacity+working group capacity: If the capacity of employees is set in days (grid "days"), the sum of all newly planned working days contained in a week is also transferred to the superordinate week. In addition, the capacities of all work groups to which the employee is assigned are adjusted. The capacity of work groups is thus automatically determined based on all assigned employees. If employees (who already have a capacity planning) are assigned to work groups at a later date, the total capacity of the work groups can be determined automatically. To do this, use the menu item "Capacity planning-->Determine capacity from subordinate resources"(see below in the "Menu" table) When recalculating the capacity, the already planned absences of the employees are automatically taken into account. So if an employee has an entered absence (holiday or illness) on one day, then this time period will not be occupied with new capacity even if the capacities are reallocated!.
Sure! I'm ready to assist you with generating questions based on the provided module description. Here are some potential questions that an unfamiliar user might ask when using the "Capacity planning" module:

1. How do I enter the total planned workload for a period in the "Capacity planning" module?
2. Can I specify the start and end dates for the planned workload in the "Capacity planning" module?
3. How do I add or remove resources (such as employees or workgroups) from the capacity planning in the "Capacity planning" module?
4. What is the difference between setting the capacity for an employee in "Days" versus "Weeks" in the "Capacity planning" module?
5. How does the system handle absences, such as holidays or illnesses, in the "Capacity planning" module?
6. Can I view the planned capacity for each resource on a daily or weekly basis in the "Capacity planning" module?
7. How do I allocate capacity to specific workgroups in the "Capacity planning" module?
8. Can I import existing capacity plans into the "Capacity planning" module?
9. Are there any predefined templates or scenarios available in the "Capacity planning" module to help me quickly create a capacity plan?
10. How does the "Set capacity" button work in the "Capacity planning" module, and what happens when I click on it?

I hope these questions cover most of the functionalities of the "Capacity planning" module! Let me know if you need further assistance or clarification.

This is the description of the module "StockStatistics" with the name "Stock statistics": This statistic is used for the overview and evaluation of warehouse stocks. It is called up by selecting parts and/or warehouses and by selecting the evaluation period(s). In addition, the currency for stock valuation can be specified; a prerequisite for this is a validly registered currency table.An evaluation of the data of all parts of a client for a certain period results in the opening or closing stock value of the fixed assets tied up in the warehouse and is thus part of the monthly statement.A warehouse statistic for ALL parts, i.e. also dispositive parts that are temporarily stored in a storage bin, can simply be carried out without pre-selection of parts. To do this, simply open the warehouse statistics, set the statistics period to be closed and select the menu item "Month-end closing" directly. For all parts found in this query, the warehouse accounts are searched for and these are saved in a collection at the user object of the logged-in user. If this user calls up the warehouse statistics again with this option (all parts without preselection) at a later time on the same day, all parts and their warehouse accounts are not searched for again, but the objects saved from the user are used again for the next run. This speeds up the month-end closing process enormously if it had to be interrupted at a certain point.General note: The module can only be called up if financial years and periods are defined in the system.Notes on month-end closing in this module: If receipts without price/value were found during the month-end closing, they are displayed as failed after the month-end closing. The prices/values can then be entered in this result window. When prices/values are added to documents at the end of the month, a note is displayed if the warehouse part does not have an average price and this should be added to the logistics account. If the average price has been entered in the logistics account, this average price can be transferred to all documents without price/value by means of the transfer button (i.e. enter the average price per part in the logistics account and then press the transfer button). Search run (Services->Inspection->Materials management tab "Stock account") for stocked parts without average price with the option to set average prices for these from the roles (according to the set logistics indicator). If this run is executed again and again (read transaction), then fewer and fewer documents without valuation are created, which then have to be corrected at the end of the monthIMPORTANT! Before closing the warehouse statistics, the batch run errors of the individual database operations must have been checked and corrected. Only in this way can the correct result be determined. This is the description of the functionality of the module "StockStatistics" with the name "Stock statistics" regarding Functionality: Automatic keeping of statistics With each warehouse booking, outgoing and incoming quantities and values are automatically adjusted in the corresponding statistics period: Storage price depending on the setting in the client, the roll price or the document price. In contrast to the receipt and issue quantities explained above, the opening and closing stocks and values are not automatically adjusted on an ongoing basis, but are only determined at the time of the month-end closing . Also at month-end closing, stock transfer, stock correction, receipt and issue values are recalculated, as they may well be adjusted if the current average price changes. Stock issues are valued using the average price of the warehouse account. A change in the average price would therefore also mean a change in the issue value! Prepare statistics and execute immediately First you should select the desired evaluation period(s). By pressing the button ("Select") you can then call up the part selection mask, in which parts can be compiled according to different criteria. On the other hand, you can call up the statistics for entire warehouses; a warehouse selection screen opens for this purpose: For the purposes of the month-end closing, you should call up all warehouses. You can also transfer parts or their part roles to the list via drag & drop, as well as entire inventory documents or only individual items. After selecting parts or warehouses, the statistics are immediately executed automatically. Run statistics again If the warehouse statistics have already been called up once, you can change the selection of periods for the entries that appeared in the list. If you change the selection of periods, the entries in the list are deleted - since the list was originally set up for a different selection of periods - after pressing the button ("Execute statistics"), a new evaluation is carried out without having to select warehouses or parts again: the originally selected selection of parts or warehouses is retained until a new selection is called up or the window is closed. Display stock/value development If parts are called up via from - to periods, then all period data of these parts are displayed. The development of turnover and/or stock values over time is thus possible. However, an overall total across all periods is not displayed. 
Sure, I'd be happy to assist! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. Can I use the StockStatistics module to evaluate the stock levels of multiple warehouses simultaneously?
2. How do I specify the currency for stock valuation in the StockStatistics module?
3. What types of reports can I generate using the StockStatistics module?
4. Can I use the StockStatistics module to track the development of stock levels and values over time?
5. How does the module handle missing average prices for parts in the warehouse accounts?
6. Can I use the StockStatistics module to identify and correct any discrepancies between the recorded stock levels and the actual stock levels in the warehouse?
7. Is it possible to export the data generated by the StockStatistics module to another system or spreadsheet program?
8. Can I use the StockStatistics module to perform a detailed analysis of the stock levels and values for specific parts or warehouses?
9. How does the module handle stock transfers and corrections when generating the stock statistics?
10. Are there any prerequisites or limitations for using the StockStatistics module?

Please let me know if you need further assistance or clarification on any of these questions!

This is the description of the functionality of the module "StockStatistics" with the name "Stock statistics" regarding Month-end closing: Selection of parts: Via the menu or symbol opens a part selection window through which specific parts or part number ranges can be selected. However, if the monthly closing is to be made for all parts in the system, it is not necessary to first select all parts via the selection screen. Only the statistics period of the period to be closed must be set and then the menu item "Month-end closing (possibly continue)" must be selected. Now the month-end closing is made for all parts. What does the month-end closing do? Within the framework of the month-end closing, the following steps are carried out by the system: In addition to or AFTER the monthly closing of the warehouse statistics, the stock turnover figures for all warehouse parts should also be carried out in a further separate step (this can also be carried out together via an option in the client ). The inventory turnover ratios can be displayed via a separate list format in the list of warehouse statistics or via the logistics account of the part. Inventory turnover ratios should only be determined after the month-end closing, because this is calculated from the final stocks of the last 13 closed months. If a month is not yet closed, there is also no closing stock. Hint: Note that when creating the month-end closing, the system-wide validity date is set to the last day of the current period to be calculated. If the evaluation is cancelled, the system-wide validity date is NOT reset to the current date, then care must be taken to reset the system-wide validity date to the current date. This is done via the main menu "System->Change date->Session date", there the field "Validity date". When should the month-end closing be made? The monthly closing should finally be carried out after the closing of a business period, otherwise the determined stocks/values (accrual) could be falsified by a further stock posting. If this is the case, it is indicated with a red dot. in the corresponding line/column: What can I influence when closing the month? In the options window, the auditor is offered the possibility of recalculating all average prices for the selected periods/parts/warehouses and saving them on the transactions (goods withdrawals and inventory documents) during the monthly closing. This operation takes longer than the 'normal' monthly closing, but it also provides a truer closing value, as each time an acquisition transaction changes, it changes the average price as if it were the last transaction in that period. It is also now possible to perform monthly closings over several periods in succession by selecting the periodic period. When closing the month, it is also no longer necessary to first run the stock statistics for the period over all parts and then start the month-end closing. You now only need to select the period and start the monthly closing. This is then run over all parts. There is an option to perform the monthly closing only for valid parts. To do this, check the box "Only valid parts" above the list before closing. If this option is activated, the test "invalid warehouses with stock" and "invalid parts with stock" should be carried out and corrected beforehand. Another option, activated by default, is to open another window following the month-end closing, showing all statistics that could not be closed due to stock movements without price. What happens after the closure and what about repeats of the monthly closure? For the individual parts and periods, it is stored who and when the last month-end closing was carried out. On the basis of this indicator and the consistency of opening balance+decrease+transfer=closing balance, it is checked whether the month has to be recalculated at all in the case of repeated month-end closing. If the entire month is nevertheless to be recalculated for all or for all selected parts, the menu item "Repeat month-end closing" must be selected. What is a month cube? A monthly cube (also simply referred to as statistics) is the statistical connection of several independent sources in which further statistical information can be collected that always refers to exactly the same data. In the example of warehouse statistics, the common sources are the following: 1. the part 2. the warehouse 3. the statistical period A monthly cube is the envelope around a part and its movements in a given storage location per month. What information does the monthly cube contain? It contains all the warehouse documents that have run for this part at this warehouse during this statistical period. It is also used to collect live movement values without having to collect and store them together overnight in any batch runs. It is therefore also possible to display all movements that have taken place in this period simply by pressing a button, as they are all stored in the monthly cube. This procedure is called OLAP (OnLine Analytic Processing) - the data is already posted to all relevant statistics when the document is posted and evaluated there. It may well be that a part A for statistics period July 2003 has 2 monthly cubes, one for warehouse B and one for warehouse C. --> If one of the three sources changes, a new cube is created. The following data are recorded in each cube :.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "StockStatistics" with the name "Stock statistics" regarding Average price calculation: During ongoing operation, the average price is continuously calculated in the warehouse account (see average price calculation); this calculation can be checked or corrected in the warehouse statistics. The following rules apply to the calculation of the average price in the warehouse statistics at the end of the month: Important note: In the options window, you can use "Average price - recalculation at month-end closing" to save the calculated average price of the month-end closing on the stock removal documents. The correction run resets the current average price stored on the inventory and the valuation price if this is empty or zero. Manually corrected valuations on the inventory are therefore not overwritten. The prices determined during the run are written to the stock withdrawal and stock transfer documents. Changing these prices also changes the withdrawal value in the current period. Therefore, while this average price is being calculated, the value for stock placements, stock removals and stock transfers is also recalculated and saved for the period. This is the description of the functionality of the module "StockStatistics" with the name "Stock statistics" regarding Lowest value inventory: In the lowest value inventory, the lowest current price of a part in the period of the warehouse statistics is always determined for the determination of the actually existing warehouse values. This results in the following order of priority for the various logistics types of parts: Production parts: Lower price from average price from warehouse account (if not zero) and manufacturing costs from production roll. Purchased parts: Lowest price from supplier agreement price of A supplier (if no A supplier exists, then the supplier agreement price of the supplier from whom the last order was placed is taken), master purchase price and average price from logistics account. This is the description of the functionality of the module "StockStatistics" with the name "Stock statistics" regarding Stock keeper: To obtain a list of warehouse keepers, simply sort the warehouse statistics by the "last departure" column. This is the description of the functionality of the module "StockStatistics" with the name "Stock statistics" regarding Stock turnover ratio - stock turnover frequency: The inventory turnover ratio (stock turnover ratio) is the quotient of the average stock of the last 13 months (closing stocks) and the sum of the total quantities withdrawn (consumed) during this period. Determination of the average stock level: The total withdrawals of the last 13 periods are now divided by this average stock, resulting in the ratio. Stock turnover ratios are determined in a further step in the course of the monthly closing of the warehouse statistics. This is done via the menu "Closing" of the warehouse statistics. They can be carried out directly or during the night (if the night service is started via a batch file), or automatically with the monthly closing via an option (in the client). Stock turnover figures should only be determined after the month-end closing, because this is calculated from the final stocks of the last 13 completed months. If a month is not yet closed, there is also no closing stock. If the inventory turnover for a part has been determined via the determination run for saving the inventory turnover key figures, this is also displayed in the logistics account of the part and can be viewed at any time. The inventory turnover ratio is primarily used to adjust the stock level (minimum stock level) of parts to the quantities actually consumed. If a part has a minimum stock of 1 piece, but approx. 20 pieces were consumed per month, then the high ratio shows that the minimum stock should be increased. If, on the other hand, a part always has ending stocks of 25 pieces on average, but only 2 pieces are consumed per month, the result is a very low (below 1) key figure, which signals that the minimum stock should be reduced. This is the description of the functionality of the module "StockStatistics" with the name "Stock statistics" regarding List window: In the list, the parts are listed for which the stock statistics are to be carried out. In addition to selecting by parts or warehouse, parts or their part roles can be transferred to the list via drag & drop, as can entire inventory documents or only individual items. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

10. Are there any prerequisites or limitations for using the stock statistics functionality in StockStatistics?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "StockStatistics" with the name "Stock statistics" regarding Exam window: The examination window can be reached via the menu "Examinations -> Evaluate and correct existing examination results". It opens automatically when an examination is started or by selecting the option "automatically after the end of the month" if examinations have failed when building up the monthly statistics. In order to obtain the most accurate assessment of the warehouse value, a possibility has been built in to check whether, for example, documents have no price/value or warehouse receipts and issues have been mixed up. The results of these checks are stored in the database and can be retrieved later at any time via the results window. The following plausibility checks have been implemented: In this window, all results of plausibility checks already carried out can be evaluated and corrected. First set the period in which the plausibility check was carried out. Then press the "Display" button or select a specific check from the combo box on the right side of the screen by unchecking "All checks". A list of monthly cubes is displayed. {img fileId="521"} In the list under the heading "Problematic monthly statistics", all months of parts that failed the selected or one of the possible exams appear. A monthly cube is the envelope around a part and its movements in a given storage location per month. In the second column of the upper list, you can see which failed inspection this record is. So we now already know that a movement without value (price) was assessed in this month. To find it now, we simply click on the month cube with the mouse. Now its stock movements appear in the lower list. Movements for which a check failed are shown in red, as can be seen in the second entry in the figure above. You can now clearly see that this movement has the price 0.00€/1piece. However, since in the simplest case it is easy to see in the other movements with which price this movement should be valued, this price can simply be added by double-clicking on the red line. If no other document is posted in this month, a search must be made in the master data for a missing price. It is always advisable to add missing standard prices to the master data, as otherwise documents without prices may be created again and again. When leaving the line, the new value is taken over. Now data has effectively been changed that could influence the average price calculation. This is what the button "Re-complete corrected" in the upper part of the window is for. If this button is pressed, all monthly cubes now visible in the list are recalculated for the entire set period and the check for zero valuation is repeated. If the monthly cube is now OK, it no longer appears in the list after the end of the process. If other errors have crept in, they will continue to appear in the list. Of course, this correction option only helps with the one error "transactions without value". This is the description of the functionality of the module "StockStatistics" with the name "Stock statistics" regarding Change the chronological order of the documents: Once a withdrawal of goods has been booked before the receipt of goods, this is not so nice if you want clean statistics. This mishap can also be corrected via this screen by double-clicking on the movement and changing the date or time of the goods withdrawal to after that of the goods receipt. A subsequent click on the month cube updates the view and one can check whether the shift has worked properly. This is the description of the functionality of the module "StockStatistics" with the name "Stock statistics" regarding Cost sharing: Allocation of the various stock postings to cost types or accounts. The values can be used to post the change in stock in the FIBU. This is the description of the functionality of the module "StockStatistics" with the name "Stock statistics" regarding Edit devaluation: Goods may no longer be worth their full purchase value for various reasons. These parts are devalued by a percentage indication in the stock statistics. In the warehouse statistics, the devaluation percentage can be determined automatically for all displayed monthly statistics or for certain selected ones. The following simple rule is applied here: The devaluation defined in the warehouse has a higher priority. The devaluations can also be changed manually via the context menu "Set devaluation manually". If this menu item is selected, an editing window opens where the new devaluation percentage can be entered. An explanation must be entered for this. Likewise, the user is saved with the date and time of the change on the statistic that he or she has changed. Useful explanations would be "goods are heavily soiled" or "water damage". A devaluation is only permissible as long as it is not negative or below the automatic devaluation. So if the automatic determination has determined 25%, the devaluation cannot be set down to 10%. This is the description of the functionality of the module "StockStatistics" with the name "Stock statistics" regarding Options window: All settings can be made here. The window can only be closed via the "OK" button. This is the description of the functionality of the module "StockStatistics" with the name "Stock statistics" regarding Automated closure: The warehouse statistics can be automated in the application calendar with the following call : "UpdateStockStatistics" SendMsg(EXEC_QUERY_STOCK_STATISTICS). can be completed on the current date. This is the description of the functionality of the module "StockStatistics" with the name "Stock statistics" regarding Technical documentation: The module represents the data that is partly written into the corresponding data cubes by the transaction descriptions (see data model) and partly calculated during reconciliation (see above monthly closing).

This is the description of the module "statwprg" with the name "Evaluation of order costs": This module is part of the final costing. The actual costs incurred for the sales orders can be listed according to the invoicing status (not invoiced/partially invoiced/invoiced) of the respective sales order and the stock orders can be listed according to the processing status (stored, provided, production order, etc.). The setting for the selection of the sales and stock orders are initialised so that the current "Unfinished products" are listed.The sales orders can also be listed together with the internal work orders assigned to them. Pre-selection by order type is also possible.All actual costs up to the selected accrual period are listed; a from - to periods list is also possible. Orders without costs can be hidden.IMPORTANT! Before calling up the job cost evaluation, the suppressed errors of the individual database operations must have been checked and corrected. Only in this way can the correct result be determined. Missing data in parts can lead to these not being taken into account in the order cost evaluation. Whether all documents assigned to the order have been posted can be checked with the context menu"Display all successors".If the order items are for a part with the staging type Kanban, no disposition, manual warehouse without main warehouse management or Kanban semi-finished product, the cost value on the order item is displayed in the ACTUAL costs column "Warehouse purchased parts".Orders are always assigned to a cost unit, i.e. the costs posted to an order are also posted to the cost unit and can be viewed via the cost unit totals list or the cost type evaluation per cost unit. However, it may well be that costs are only posted to cost units - without specifying an order - which is why there may be differences between the details of the costs in this order cost evaluation and those in the above-mentioned other cost unit lists. This is the description of the functionality of the module "statwprg" with the name "Evaluation of order costs" regarding Accrual period: The accrual period defines up to which point in time or from which period costs are to be used for the calculation of order costs in the list. The accrual period is not used to select the orders directly, i.e. you can use it to select orders that were created in a specific period. If the "from-to period" checkbox is not set, all bookings with costs up to the accounting period are taken into account. If the "from-to-period" checkbox is set, only bookings with costs that were booked between the two accounting periods are taken into account. This is the description of the functionality of the module "statwprg" with the name "Evaluation of order costs" regarding Check options: Various options are available for checking the order cost evaluation via the context menu (right mouse button) of the list (see). This is the description of the functionality of the module "statwprg" with the name "Evaluation of order costs" regarding Display of recalculated actual documents: Documents are automatically entered for the final costing when they are posted. The current costs are determined from the standard value of the order part or the material and labour costs of the production part. If costs could be determined, the document is displayed with the list "posted documents". In the case of missing costs or other errors due to incomplete or incorrect data, the document is listed with the suppressed errors. This is the description of the functionality of the module "statwprg" with the name "Evaluation of order costs" regarding Display of all subsequent documents (from document history).: Display of all documents that were posted with the order and normally contain actual costs for costing. You can output this list "posted documents" selected according to documents with and without costs. Documents without costs were not posted in the final costing and must be checked and posted via the module "suppressed errors". The unposted vouchers can be corrected in the selection "Displayvouchers without costs" via the context menu of the list"Display suppressed errors for voucher". This is the description of the functionality of the module "statwprg" with the name "Evaluation of order costs" regarding Display of recalculated actual material costs: A list of all parts that were posted for the order in the cost estimate with actual costs. This is the description of the functionality of the module "statwprg" with the name "Evaluation of order costs" regarding Total costs: Displays the sum of the actual costs for the selected rows. This is the description of the functionality of the module "statwprg" with the name "Evaluation of order costs" regarding Recalculate actual costs: Here you can recalculate the actual costs of the stock movements (i.e. stock removal and stock placements), the exploded parts lists (e.g. JIT, KANBAN parts and manual stock) and the PDC working times for the orders selected in the list box. Normally, only the documents that are already taken into account in the final costing are recalculated. However, by setting the checkbox "Check successor documents not taken into account", you can ensure that all successor documents are checked. Each document is booked out of the recalculation and booked in again as selected with the valid costs on the document date or the validity date that can be entered in the mask. The new actual costs are immediately written into the documents and thus into the post-calculation of the order. By recalculating the documents with the document date, you only have the possibility to approximate the old status. Therefore, the call of this function should be carried out with care, preferably in a test environment first. For tracking purposes, all changes to the actual costs of the recalculation are written to the file "NeuBerechnungIstKosten_Datum.log" in the temporary directory. Hint: Note that the system-wide validity date is changed when recalculating. 
Sure, I'd be happy to assist you with generating realistic questions based on the given module description! Here are some potential questions that a user might ask when using the "Evaluation of Order Costs" module:

This is the description of the functionality of the module "statwprg" with the name "Evaluation of order costs" regarding Document identification: If a document is found in the post-calculation that has the flag realEnd.counter2 = 1 AND realEnd.counter3 = 1, then this document must first be booked out!If a document is found in the post-calculation that has the flag realEnd.counter[[2] = 1 AND realEnd.counter[[3] = 1, then this document must first be booked out! Explanation regarding night runs: As soon as a document has bit 1, 2 or 5, it is no longer used for the night run. If such documents are booked out and in, the calculation is booked immediately. During operation, each document to be booked out must be checked to see whether it must also be booked out of the calculation. The module recognises this at the realEnd.counter3=1. If the item is now booked out, changed and booked in again by the normal booking, the module recognises at the realEnd.counter2 that this document must be booked back into the post-calculation. The realEnd.counter2 is never deleted from the document once it has been set. It is the indicator that the document has already been posted once in the post-calculation.During operation, each document to be booked out must be checked to see whether it must also be booked out of the calculation. The module recognises this by the realEnd.counter[[3]=1. If the item is now booked out, changed and booked in again by the normal booking, the module recognises by the realEnd.counter[[2] that this document must be booked back into the post-calculation. The realEnd.counter[[2] is never deleted from the document once it has been set. It is the indicator that the document has already been posted once in the post-calculation. If the realEnd.counter5 is set on a document, it does not need to be booked out of the post-calculation before normal posting and it does not need to be booked in again! However, this module takes care of this check, it does not need to be checked in any other module!If the realEnd.counter[[5] is set on a document, it does not need to be booked out of the post-calculation before normal posting and it also does not need to be booked in again!!! But this module takes care of this check, it does not need to be checked in any other module!. This is the description of the functionality of the module "statwprg" with the name "Evaluation of order costs" regarding Online posting of vouchers - principles: If the voucher has already been posted to the final costing, it must be booked out beforehand. This is usually implemented via the BookItem and UnbookItem macros of the respective module. Here, before the document is posted out of its normal posting, it is first checked whether bit 3 of the realEnd.counter is set, i.e. whether the document is also posted in the post-calculation: transaction Copy(realEnd.counter3) iftransaction Copy(realEnd.counter[[3]) if { } After posting via the normal update, it must then also be checked whether the document is to be posted to the final costing: Bit 2 of the realEnd.counter s provides information about this. transaction Copy(realEnd.counter2) iftransaction Copy(realEnd.counter[[2]) if { }.

This is the description of the module "objinsp" with the name "CyberEnterprise Inspector": This module "CyberEnterprise Inspector" is a collection of universal display and editing tools for the objects stored in a database. The Inspector basically fulfils three tasks: Display objects and collections (object lists) Editing data fields in objects navigate from one object to other objects via pointers and relations The Inspector also has a number of tools for advanced direct operations with objects and/or the database. Because the Object Inspector provides a user-friendly environment for direct data access, it is recommended to grant access to the CyberEnterprise Inspector only to specially trained users. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objinsp" with the name "CyberEnterprise Inspector" regarding Input window: Any persistent or transient object can be displayed in the inspector (tab Object Inspector). The actual editing and navigation functionality of the Object Inspector is divided into the following tabs:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objinsp" with the name "CyberEnterprise Inspector" regarding Edit COM object: The COM object is displayed in the upper part of the window. In the lower part of the window, a list of the functions associated with this COM object is displayed. The function is called up by double-clicking on it. A window for entering the parameters is opened first. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objinsp" with the name "CyberEnterprise Inspector" regarding Enter DB address: The database address of a persistent object can be entered directly in this window. In the upper field a full database address of a persistent object can be entered directly. By clicking the button "Resolve" this address is displayed in the second line divided into the individual sections. Once an address with its individual sections has been entered, the OK button loads the corresponding object from the database into the Object Inspector. Structure of database addresses A database address is usually structured as follows: < Layer | Segment | Cluster | Offset | Size > The layer, segment, cluster and offset indicate the exact position where the object is stored in the database. The offset is given in hexadecimal notation, whereby leading zeros are (or can be) omitted. It should be noted that the specification of the layer is only relevant for ClassiX® and is not relevant for ObjectStore. The uniqueness of an address results from segment, cluster and offset alone. The last part, Size, indicates the mapping size (in hex). This is 64 KB by default, i.e. 10000. If, for example, the following sentence appears in an error message, the database address can be derived from it: "The object is at offset 0x1374 within cluster #0, segment #384 of Database Y:\classix.cxd".

This is the description of the module "processes_attribute" with the name "Attributes - Processes": 2.1 Preset attribute A preset attribute allows a dynamic data field to be given a descriptive name, further explanatory data or a default setting. Example: A carpet seller with a ClassiX® software wants to describe his carpets by different characteristics. For example, all carpets should be described by their price. So he adds a characteristic to all master data, in which he can then specify the price. If individual carpets are to be described by their colour (no free input, only colours from a colour table should be available), he can do this by means of an attribute, which for example describes a data field of type 'String'. This attribute is then provided with a table with the different colours. Attention: Attribute values are only supported in the formulas up to a maximum of 100 characters! 2.2 Formula attributes As the name suggests, formula attributes are used to fill a data field with a formula, or with the value that the formula calculates. Constants can be entered directly into the formula while the variable values are slot attributes. Example: The carpet seller now wants to describe his carpets also by size, whereby the carpets have the characteristic that all carpets have the same width (4m) and differ only in length. Here the carpet seller benefits from the formula attributes. So he creates an attribute with the formula '4m * length'. The length is again a preset attribute, whereby the value or the result of the formula attribute changes automatically when the value is changed. 2.3 Conditional attributes Conditional attributes can contain a table that describes an "if - then" relationship. Example: The carpets of the carpet seller are to have their own price per colour. We now create a conditional attribute and fill the table with the data we need for the price calculation. (e.g.: red -> 10 € ; blue -> 20 € ; yellow -> 30€ ) In addition, we set our just created attribute in dependence of the attribute for the colour.(see example Preset attribute) If the attribute for the colour is changed, the corresponding value of the condition table is now automatically returned. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_attribute" with the name "Attributes - Processes" regarding 1. why attributes?: Attributes are of central importance in ClassiX®, as they allow to describe an object (object, person object or similar) in all its characteristics without having to make changes to the source code. Example: The aim is to describe a sales item by its colour. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_attribute" with the name "Attributes - Processes" regarding 6. gradual and conditional expression of attributes: Attribute nodes allow the gradual and conditional expression of attributes. This is particularly useful in product configuration (the specification of variant parts), but can also be useful when entering any form (document) or master data. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_attribute" with the name "Attributes - Processes" regarding Application example for the gradual development: An application example for the gradual development of attributes is the division of a complex table of values of an attribute. Let us assume there is an attribute "MATERIAL". Behind this attribute there is a very large selection of different materials (various types of steel, aluminium and plastic as well as numerous alloys). This table can become very long, so it could take longer to select the right material. As a solution to this problem, the attribute "MATERIAL" can be created several times and the result table can be restricted in each case. So mine could create an attribute for steel, aluminium etc. and offer only the corresponding selection options as a result table. In addition you would have to create a new attribute "MATERIAL_ART" with the selection table: steel, aluminium, plastic and alloys. Behind this attribute, an attribute node is stored, which refers to the corresponding attribute "MATERIAL" depending on the set value. For example, in the sales item the attribute "MATERIAL_ART" is then inserted instead of the complex table "MATERIAL". In the order, you then first select "MATERIAL_ART". The corresponding attribute "MATERIAL" is then automatically added and in the second step this value can then be set. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_attribute" with the name "Attributes - Processes" regarding Application example for the conditional gradual characteristic: The conditional characteristic behaves similarly to the application example mentioned above, but is a little more complex. In the first example, the expression of one attribute led to other attributes with the same name with filtered result tables. However, an extensive product configuration can also be carried out via the attribute nodes. Let us imagine the configuration of a car. A car can be defined by many parameters. However, these parameters can be strongly interdependent. For example, after selecting 2- or 4-door, the question of rear electric windows may be obsolete. The same applies if one of the parameters is selected as the series and various extras are then already included. This type of multi-level conditional configuration is also possible via the attribute nodes. 
Sure, I'd be happy to assist! Based on the provided module description, here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "processes_attribute" module:

1. What is the purpose of the "preset attribute" feature in the "processes_attribute" module?
2. Can you provide an example of how to use formula attributes in the "processes_attribute" module?

8. Is it possible to create multiple instances of the same attribute in the "processes_attribute" module, and if so, how would you go about doing that?
9. Can you explain how the "MATERIAL" attribute works in the "processes_attribute" module, and how it relates to the "MATERIAL_ART" attribute?
10. Are there any limitations or restrictions on the number of attributes that can be created using the "processes_attribute" module, and if so, what are they?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_attribute" with the name "Attributes - Processes" regarding 7. editing of attributes in master and transaction data: The group for editing attributes on master data and transaction data is usually as follows. {img fileId="248" thumb="box" width="100%"} Global attributes are represented by the globe, local attributes are marked with the box. The values can be maintained by double-clicking on one of the attributes. Behind the purple lines there are visible attributes which have been inserted in a structured way. This means that various attributes have been combined into an attribute node (see Structuring of Attributes). By double-clicking on the purple line, the node is expanded and the attributes of this node are displayed. Another double-click collapses the node again. The button "Edit" leads to a selected global attribute to edit the attribute value in the list. local attribute for editing the attribute in the edit mask purple attribute node for editing the node designation in the list The list of attributes can be extended by clicking the "Insert" button. The normal case is that a root attribute is selected and inserted. Here there are the options "At end", "Before selected position" and "Behind selected position". In addition, a local attribute can also be created. Here the type of the attribute ("Presettable", "Calculated", "Conditional") must be determined via the menu. Via the menu "Insert new structural level" an attribute node can be created manually. Attributes can then be moved up and down in this node using the arrows. The arrow keys take over the function to determine the order of the attributes. You can also move an attribute into an attribute node or retrieve it again. Before attributes are moved to a level from within it, the user is asked if he really wants to perform this action. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_attribute" with the name "Attributes - Processes" regarding 8. use of comparison operators: Even before creating a new attribute with an attached table, it is important to know how to work with it later. You must also be aware that the attributes can have different types internally, e.g. STRING, ENUMCHAR, etc. In the case of characteristics created as type STRING or with a data field of type STRING, the value (text) entered by the user is retained internally and is therefore also used for comparisons. If, however, you create a characteristic with the type ENUMCHAR, for example, the internal structure of the attached table is different. There is no longer the value directly (e.g. text in the case of the type STRING), but in the internal table there is a numbering given by the feeder and for each of the entries the value to be shown externally, e.g. 1 -> apples, 2 -> pears and 3 -> bananas. For comparison operations, the internal value is always used in all cases of e.g. ENUMCHAR, because you cannot compare apples with pears over "bigger" or "smaller", so to speak. But of course you can test for "equal" without any problems, but you have to be very careful with "not equal" comparisons. This is especially true in cases where one has created, for example, the following table: 1 -> "100", 2 -> "200" and 3 -> "150". There you cannot simply make the comparison "less than or equal to 200", because the "200" is first converted into the internal value 2, and with the internal values only 1 and 2 are "less than or equal to 2", so that the entry 3 -> "150" is not output.

This is the description of the module "cxAsset" with the name "Asset": With this module of fixed asset accounting, the fixed assets or assets of a company are managed. The fixed assets of a company include all assets that are intended to serve the business operations on a permanent or long-term basis. The fixed asset accounts of the general ledger of the financial accounting are managed as collective accounts. In order to be able to determine the depreciation within the scope of the inventory on the balance sheet date correctly, a fixed asset accounting is required as subledger.The management of fixed assets also includes posting, for example, as additions, subsequent increases or disposals.Since 01.01.2004 the simplification rule has ceased to apply and newly acquired assets are written off pro rata temporis - to the month.Changes in the book value of an asset are made by means of manually or automatically created postings (e.g. automatic depreciation at the end of a fiscal year):AccessOutletPartial outflowAttribution DepreciationCollective depreciationNormally, the module automatically calculates the depreciation allowed for tax purposes at the end of a current fiscal year. In the case of fixed assets for which the calculation of depreciation is generally very individual (e.g. buildings), you can always enter "individual plan" as the type of depreciation. This is an indication that the annual depreciation should and will always and only be posted manually. In addition, a depreciation posting can be marked as an annual depreciation posting, which also means that the annual depreciation is not calculated automatically. If asset accounting is newly set up, a standardised import interface is available. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAsset" with the name "Asset" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain fixed assets. You can select an asset by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. The menu item "Search" takes you to the "List fixed assets" screen of the list window. This screen allows you to search for individual fixed assets by inventory number, search term, G/L account or cost centre and select them by double-clicking. The maintenance of the data is subdivided into general information on the asset, information on tax depreciation and the life of the asset from a tax point of view. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAsset" with the name "Asset" regarding Annex: In the "Asset" tab, all general information about the asset is maintained:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAsset" with the name "Asset" regarding Features: In the "Characteristics" tab, you can add further characteristics data to the asset. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAsset" with the name "Asset" regarding Tax depreciation: The tab "tax depreciation" displays all the data required by the program to calculate the deduction for wear and tear - also called depreciation or amortisation. This data is filled by postings (acquisition, retirement, year-end closing, etc.) In the lower part of the screen, the taxable annual book values and the corresponding posting types are shown in total from the year of acquisition to the disposal of the respective fixed asset. By deleting postings, it may be possible that an annual account remains in the list without posting values. Such annual values can be deleted by means of the right mouse button and selecting the context menu item "Remove empty annual account". Note: you can drag and drop an entry from the list directly into the asset totals list to display the values of a year in detail there. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAsset" with the name "Asset" regarding Curriculum vitae (tax): The "Curriculum Vitae (tax)" tab shows exactly how the asset has developed over the years and how the book value of the asset is made up of the postings made to the asset. Entries in an annual account that has not yet been closed can be edited and changed subsequently by double-clicking with the mouse. New bookings are triggered via the context menu accessible via the right mouse button. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAsset" with the name "Asset" regarding Bookings: Changes to the book value of an asset are made through special entries that can be accessed via the main menu or through the context menu accessible in the life window by right-clicking:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAsset" with the name "Asset" regarding Access: An acquisition posting is made on the one hand when an asset is newly included in fixed asset accounting, but also when the acquisition or production costs are subsequently increased (post-capitalisation). Subsequent costs of acquisition can only be those expenses that do not result in a change in the asset originally acquired and which would ultimately have been classified as acquisition costs at the time of acquisition. Accordingly, the value of a post-capitalisation is added to the residual value of the asset in the (original) year of acquisition and depreciated over the remaining useful life. The situation is somewhatdifferent for capital goods for which "no depreciation" is specified as the depreciation type, as these are written off manually (e.g. securities). Here, the date and useful life of later acquisitions (post-capitalisation) is irrelevant for depreciation, as depreciation is calculated and entered manually anyway. For this reason, you enter the actual date of acquisition for such assets in the field Beginning of depreciation (see below) for subsequent acquisitions. If you have made a mistake in the first acquisition posting for an asset (e.g. entered an incorrect A/H date), it is advisable to delete this posting (via the context menu of the postings) AND the resulting annual account (via the right mouse button on the annual account). This also completely resets the tax data of the asset.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAsset" with the name "Asset" regarding Disposal: Fixed assets that are no longer available to the company for use are to be derecognised from fixed asset accounting at their book value. In most cases, assets are not derecognised on the balance sheet date but in the course of a financial year. In this case, depreciation must be carried out pro rata temporis in accordance with tax law. As in the year of acquisition, depreciation may be rounded up to full months. The period between the last balance sheet date and the date of retirement is decisive. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAsset" with the name "Asset" regarding Partial disposal: Subsequent reductions in acquisition or production costs are to be taken into account in the year of reduction as if the reduction had occurred at the beginning of the year. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAsset" with the name "Asset" regarding Attribution: Write-ups are made on the basis of reversals of impairment losses, e.g. if an impairment loss is corrected.

This is the description of the module "qm_message_qm" with the name "English:Messages, garbage collection, module reloading": This routine tests the following functions and tries to detect errors: Message Passing Sent and received messages are counted and the counters are compared. CURRENT / NON_CURRENT for the modules is monitored and it is tested whether the messages received from window objects arrive according to the parent-child hierarchy. Garbage Collection Each module tests an invariant value for immutability - i.e. protection against garbage collection - while all modules intentionally produce a lot of stack data. Reload modules There are three different implementations for the Beta module, but they all respond to the messages sent by the main programme. From time to time, the current version for module beta is replaced by one of the others in random order. The test runs endlessly, so it is intended for a longer runtime. As soon as an error is detected, an error message appears. At the same time, a log file is created in the directory where the ClassiX® application was started. This allows to follow the test procedure and possible errors are recorded. // This module performs all actions in random order, thus we may detect errors // that occur under certain conditions only. // These actions are: // sending message ALFA, BETA, or GAMMA // sending message CLOSE_WINx with (x = A, B, C) // reloading module Beta with different implementations (1 - 3) // // Actions and errors are written into file MSGTEST.LOG // // // This test routine covers the following basic functionality: // // - Corrent Message Passing // Sended and received messages are counted and checked. // Window objects check arrival of messages according to parent-child-hierachy. // CURRENT / NON_CURRENT received by any module are tested to arrive in proper sequence // // - Garbage Collection // To detect possible errors in garbage collection, invariant values are repeatedly checked and // all modules produce deliberately lots of garbage. // // - Reloading of Modules // Module Beta is frequently reloaded, chosing arbitrarily among there are 3 different implementations. //.

This is the description of the module "objnavi" with the name "Object Navigator": The Object Navigator enables a three-dimensional view of objects and their connections. It attempts to enable the user to understand the data by additionally displaying the context of an object (the neighbouring objects connected to it). It is possible to follow up connections by adding its context to one of the displayed objects. Thus, paths between objects within the database can be investigated. There is a general display mode for the objects, but if required, it is also possible to switch to correspondingly optimised displays for special circumstances. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objnavi" with the name "Object Navigator" regarding Navigation: In the three-dimensional world of the Object Navigator, navigation with the mouse is possible. By holding down the left mouse button the objects can be rotated, by holding down the right mouse button they can be moved. Zooming in and out is possible with the mouse wheel. Using the context menu of the right mouse button an object can be centred, i.e. rotation with the left mouse button uses this object as centre. It is also possible to edit an object or call up the object inspector via the context menu. The remaining menu items in the context menu correspond to the options in the Control Module. A double click with the left mouse button on an object expands it, thus displaying the context of the object. The object automatically moves to the centre of the display. In this way a path can be followed step by step, i.e. it can be "wandered" through the database. An object can be selected with a simple left click. This object is then highlighted. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objnavi" with the name "Object Navigator" regarding Landscapes: The display modes of the Object Navigator, which have been specially optimised for a particular situation, are called "Landscape". It is possible to switch between the landscapes at any time. From the point of switching, all newly added objects are displayed in this landscape. To make this possible, a starting point for the landscape must always be selected before switching (this is done by using the left mouse button). Not all landscapes make sense for all objects. The correct starting points are always mentioned in the table of landscapes below. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objnavi" with the name "Object Navigator" regarding Control module: The upper list contains the start objects. By double-clicking on an object, the display of the object can be called up. The lower list contains all objects currently displayed. By double-clicking an object, it can be centred, i.e. moved to the centre of the display. In the middle area are all options, which can be controlled accordingly via the checkboxes and radio buttons.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "txnuse" with the name "Use of tasks and task folders" regarding Introduction: With the activity documents and the activity folders, ClassiX® provides a powerful instrument for the management, control and archiving of business communication. However, in order to be able to use these means in a meaningful way, some prerequisites are required. These will be explained in this document. In addition, the exact workflows for recording the transactions are described, including examples. In addition, there are some tips on how to handle the documents and folders. But one thing in advance: without consistent use, the best capture and visualisation tools make no sense. This is the description of the functionality of the module "txnuse" with the name "Use of tasks and task folders" regarding Transaction documents: An activity document always represents an activity. These can be divided into 4 types: In terms of functionality, all types offer the same, this classification is only for a better overview and for some automatic functions. For example, for letters and faxes, the corresponding templates are always loaded. A transaction document is now used to record all information about a transaction. In addition to standards such as date, subject, completed, etc., various fields are available. In addition, any number of recipients can be specified and in which transaction folders the document should be saved. To further increase flexibility, ClassiX® allows to attach any external files to a transaction. This way, almost everything can be recorded specific to the transaction. In order to also record a sequence of transactions in the overall context, follow-on documents can be created. In this way, the entire correspondence on a topic can be recorded chronologically. Most importantly, however, it is not only possible to record events from the past, but also to create a corresponding document at the same time as a letter is created. To keep the effort as low as possible, you can write and print your letter directly from the document. In addition, ClassiX® is also able to dynamically insert already existing data. This is the description of the functionality of the module "txnuse" with the name "Use of tasks and task folders" regarding Example: Creating a letter: The first step is to create a new letter process. Together with the editing mask for the document, Microsoft Word is also started and the preset document template is loaded. Here you can now write the actual text of the letter. To return to ClassiX®, Word can simply be closed. Now the additional data for the document are entered (subject, recipient, ). ClassiX® will then automatically add these data to the Word document. Now the letter just needs to be printed with ClassiX® print function. The most important thing is to use the transaction documents consistently. Only in this way is it possible to create a complete and well-organised archive of business correspondence over time. If letters, e-mails, etc. are always created together with a transaction document from ClassiX®, the additional work is limited. However, once some e-mails have been created, for example, it is quite a lot of work to record and integrate them afterwards.
Sure! Based on the given module description, here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "txnuse" module:

1. What is the purpose of the "txnuse" module in ClassiX?
2. Can you explain the different types of activity documents in the "txnuse" module, and what each type is used for?

This is the description of the module "servinqu" with the name "Service request": With this module service requests/error messages/problems of a customer can be recorded and scheduled. Such service call objects can be created e.g. directly from an industrial plant - this should be the origin of the customer's problem - whereby the customer, the plant and the plant group are automatically taken over. The core functionality of this module is that for each service call the employee who is to take care of the service call can be directly assigned. For this purpose, the employee can be assigned his capacity by first selecting the employee concerned via the employee list and then opening the capacity planning via the menu item "Edit->Set->Capacity planning". The service call also has an automatic planning function: the determination button on the position can determine an employee who can be deployed or a free period of time based on the data entered so far on the position. On the one hand, it is possible to specify a working group (field Provider) and a planning date with duration on the position. The button then determines the first member of the working group who has the specified capacity (duration) at the specified time. If no working group is specified, all employees of the employee master data are searched. On the other hand, the planning date can also be determined if this is emptied and then an employee is selected. The button then determines when the employee has the planned duration of capacity available and enters the date automatically. If no freelancer or free capacity is found, the mask will not be filled in. Step 1: Setting the employee capacity The system now knows how much working time can be planned for this employee. Step 2: Planning of requirements Via the editing mask of the industrial plants, in the tab "Plant groups", a plant group can now be selected and on it the menu item "Create service call" can be chosen. A new document, the service call, is created. The plant group and the customer from the industrial plant are immediately transferred to it. In the new mask, the description of what the service call was about can now be entered, for example the error description that the customer gave over the phone. At this point, neither an offer nor an order has been created. After entering the description, the document is first saved by pressing the "OK" button. As soon as it is now clear that the service call is to be carried out and bindingly scheduled, sub-items can be inserted on which the date (planned date), the planned duration and an employee must be specified. A new project and a new order is created in the background with a plant group and a service provider group. The service provider group is displayed as a sub-item of the service call. The data entered here are immediately booked into the employee requirement and can be found as planned requirements in its capacity planning. Step 3: Overview of the planned capacity: Please see the description of capacity utilisation for the procedure for the evaluation or the description of the worklist. This is the description of the functionality of the module "servinqu" with the name "Service request" regarding Position window: The editing window of the service item is similar to the input window of the work certificate, but not all widgets are displayed.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_accounting" with the name "Invoice - account assignment and initial account assignment" regarding Preliminary account assignment in general: In order to transfer costs and revenues to the financial accounting, ClassiX® provides a preliminary account assignment of various documents, such as incoming and outgoing invoices. During the initial account assignment the costs incurred (incoming invoices) and revenues (outgoing invoices) are assigned to different evaluation objects. In addition to the cost element (or the G/L account), these are the cost centres and the cost object. The initial account assignment is carried out automatically when the documents are posted. The rules for this are described on this page. During the initial account assignment, so-called posting containers are created. In addition to the value to be posted, the account (cost element or G/L account) to which the value is to be posted in financial accounting is specified here. The setting, whether account assignment is to be made via a cost element or a G/L account, is specified via the option "Cost element accounting" in the client. If no account can be determined during the initial account assignment, no posting container is created. Cost centre and cost unit accounting is also activated above the client. In these cases, the posting container can also contain the cost centre and/or cost object to be debited or credited. The cost element defines whether a cost object or cost centre is allowed or mandatory for a cost element. After the initial account assignment, the created posting containers are checked for these specifications. In the detailed initial account assignment, which can also be activated via the client, each invoice item is individually preassigned. This means that cost element, cost centre and cost object are determined individually for each item. The summation of the posting containers takes place in the document header, however, as only this is posted in the financial accounting. The sum of the values of the booking containers must always equal the gross value of the invoice. If this is not the case, for example because an account could not be determined and therefore no posting container could be created, the invoice is considered as not assigned to an account. In this case, it is possible to carry out the initial account assignment manually via the incoming invoice book or the outgoing invoice book. Even in the case of automatically preassigned invoices, the account assignment can be checked once again before posting the documents in the financial accounting system and, if necessary, changed manually. This task is also carried out by the incoming or outgoing invoice book. Another example for the account assignment in ClassiX® is the cash book, in which the vouchers are directly assigned and posted. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_accounting" with the name "Invoice - account assignment and initial account assignment" regarding Determining the account: For both incoming and outgoing invoices, the account of the posting containers is determined via statistics groups. In sales these are the sales statistics groups, which are assigned to the article groups of the sales roles. In purchasing these are the purchasing statistics groups which are assigned to the parts classifications of the parts. (Since a part can only have one order article role at a time, the purchasing statistics groups are thus also directly assigned to the order articles). Through the direct assignment of the order articles or sales roles to the mentioned statistics groups, which conditionally specify the account directly or via a table, both an article group-oriented and a partner-oriented account assignment can be made. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_accounting" with the name "Invoice - account assignment and initial account assignment" regarding Article group-oriented account assignment: With the article group-oriented initial account assignment, in the structure "article group" (sales) or "parts classification" (purchasing), each account is assigned its own statistics group and thus usually a fixed or conditional account. This is done via the purchasing or sales statistics groups. If an A/R or A/P invoice item is assigned to an account, the account is determined via the item's article and the item is assigned to an account. Sales: Outgoing invoice item -> sales article role -> article group -> sales statistics group -> account Purchasing: Incoming invoice item -> part -> parts classification -> purchasing statistics group -> account Text articles have no article group assignment by default and are therefore not automatically assigned to an account. There are two ways to change this. On the one hand, the statistics group which is then used to determine the account can be specified in the order/invoice item. On the other hand, the account - if necessary also a conditional account - can be directly assigned to the classification term "sales statistics groups". The prerequisite for this is that no sales article is directly assigned to the classification term "statistics groups", but only to a subnode. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_accounting" with the name "Invoice - account assignment and initial account assignment" regarding Partner-oriented account assignment: With partner-oriented account assignment, the account is determined independently of the articles. In this case, only one (purchasing/sales) statistics group is linked to the top structure node of the article group or parts classification. The account is determined conditionally using this statistics group. As a rule, partner data, such as the tax type (German tax, EU taxation, foreign tax) or document data, such as the tax key, is queried in the conditions. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. How do I set up the initial account assignment for incoming and outgoing invoices in ClassiX?
2. Can I assign multiple accounts to an invoice item in ClassiX? If so, how?
3. What is the difference between article-group-oriented and partner-oriented account assignment in ClassiX?
4. How do I define the statistical groups for determining the account in ClassiX?
5. Can I assign a conditional account to an invoice item in ClassiX? If so, how?
6. How does the cash book function work in relation to account assignment in ClassiX?
7. Is there a way to manually check and adjust the account assignment for invoices in ClassiX?
8. Can I assign different accounts to different invoice items within the same document in ClassiX?
9. How does the sales statistics group and purchasing statistics group affect the account assignment in ClassiX?
10. Are there any specific settings or configurations required for article-group-oriented or partner-oriented account assignment in ClassiX?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_accounting" with the name "Invoice - account assignment and initial account assignment" regarding A sales statistics group is assigned to the structure node of the item group (or a higher-level node) as a structured object. {img type="fileId" fileId="103"}: In the sales statistics group, the assignment to the structure node can be maintained. You can also edit the conditional account. {img type="fileId" fileId="105"} The conditional account is used to determine the cost element or the G/L account depending on the condition. {img type="fileId" fileId="104"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_accounting" with the name "Invoice - account assignment and initial account assignment" regarding Account assignment of incoming invoices: The account assignment of incoming invoices differs from the account assignment of outgoing invoices in that, as an alternative to the account assignment via the statistics groups, the cost element or the G/L account can also be specified directly in the item. If no partner-oriented account assignment is carried out or the article group-oriented account assignment is not defined via the groups, the cost element or G/L account can even be specified in the order article, which is then transferred to the incoming invoice item. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_accounting" with the name "Invoice - account assignment and initial account assignment" regarding Determination of cost units and cost centres: The determination of cost centres and cost objects is identical in principle for outgoing and incoming invoices, but differs in one detail. In both cases, the cost centres and cost objects are defined by their predecessors and transferred to the invoice items. The difference between the outgoing and incoming invoices is that in the case of the outgoing invoices, the items can only be assigned to one cost object and cost centre, as these always have only one predecessor. Overall, an invoice can also apply to several cost objects and cost centres, but not at item level. An incoming invoice item, on the other hand, can also debit several cost objects, if, for example, parts of different orders were procured via one order item. The same applies to the cost centre. In this case, the costs are distributed to the various cost centres and cost objects during initial account assignment. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_accounting" with the name "Invoice - account assignment and initial account assignment" regarding Determination of the cost units/cost centres to be debited ("normal" incoming invoice items): When distributing the costs of an incoming invoice item to several cost objects and cost centres, it is assumed that all predecessors have the same part and therefore the share of the predecessors in the costs can be determined based on the quantity. If, during the allocation of costs, it is determined that only one cost unit and/or one cost centre is charged, this is displayed in the editing window of the incoming invoice items and can also be changed here. The initial account assignment is then always made to the cost object and cost centre displayed in the mask. If it was determined when creating the incoming invoice item that different cost objects and cost centres must be debited, these are saved internally together with the share (in percent) of the costs of the item. In the editing window of the incoming invoice item, one of the cost units and cost centres is then randomly displayed. If the user now selects a new cost centre or a different cost object via the item mask, the following question is asked when saving {img type="fileId" fileId="107"} If he confirms this question with "yes", the internal allocation of costs to the various cost centres and cost objects is deleted and only the selected evaluation objects are debited. If the costs are still to be distributed to different cost centres/cost objects afterwards, the invoice must be manually assigned to an account in the invoice receipt book. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_accounting" with the name "Invoice - account assignment and initial account assignment" regarding Determination of the cost units/cost centres to be debited for free incoming invoice items: In the case of free items, the costs are divided similarly, but as these have different order items with different parts as predecessors, a division according to quantity makes no sense. Therefore the value of the delivery schedule line is taken into account in the allocation. If one or more order headers are selected as predecessors, all delivery schedule lines are taken into account in the cost allocation.

This is the description of the module "stock" with the name "Stock": Each warehouse must be created in the CyberEnterprise business OS. This describes a specific room, a specific building, which serves as a warehouse for parts. Within a warehouse, the individual storage locations must also be stored in the system as storage bins. In CyberEnterprise business OS, warehouses and their storage locations are not only textual information but describe accounts with their respective stock values. (see also the processing of a warehouse posting in an OLAP network from accounts).A warehouse can be assigned an administrator, an owner and/or a cost centre. The address of the manager is taken over as the address of the warehouse (as a copy). This address can be overwritten manually. In the 'Control' tab, the type of warehouse can be declared as a consignment warehouse, a customs warehouse or a manual warehouse. Such warehouse types can also be specified in more detail in the form of classification terms (see below). Furthermore, warehouses can be marked as non MRP if the stocks of these warehouses are not to be taken into account in MRP from requirement and stock lists. In addition to these indications, different classification keys can be assigned to a warehouse, e.g. in order to assign the warehouse to a storage type (e.g. in addition or optional to the above mentioned type indications), to a (total) storage area, etc. The classification keys can also be assigned to the storage type (see below). Once assigned, the classification terms can be supplemented with characteristics in order to optimally control warehouse management. In the standard system, the term "storage type" is predefined as a classification term for a warehouse with the identifier "STORAGE_TYPE". Sub-concepts for freely definable storage types are Block storage, open-air storage, high rack storage, picking warehouse, shelf storage, etc. The storage bins assigned to a warehouse can also be assigned to classification keys (see there classification key "PICKING_ZONE" for picking zones or storage areas); it is up to the internal organisation to find an optimal structure of the information for the company. By assigning warehouses to company codes, logistical control (e.g. specification of minimum stock levels) and stock monitoring can be further differentiated. If a company code has been assigned, the"no disposition" indicator should also be set. The identification as "chaotic warehouse" serves to have the system automatically allocate an empty storage bin when goods are received. In the tab 'Domains' it can be specified whether and to which domains the stock of parts in storage bins of this warehouse should be divided. (Not implemented in the standard system). This is the description of the functionality of the module "stock" with the name "Stock" regarding Input window: This window is used for the maintenance of bearings. You can select a warehouse by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search".

This is the description of the module "vatreturn" with the name "Advance turnover tax return (module)": This module is used to create and display a VAT advance return. The evaluation is created via the form for the advance return for VAT, which must be stored as a structure with identifier VAT_RETURN_REPORT. In the structure/keyword as structure-ID the number of the field on the form as short name the description of the field position on the form and as description the line number on the form, with 2 amounts on one line followed by "l" for left and "r" for right, e.g. 30l and 30r to be indicated. In principle, all postings that were posted with a tax key are processed in the advance return for sales tax. (The items of the VAT form are stored in the tax key). In addition, this information can also be stored for a G/L account in order to also be able to consider postings without a tax key in the advance return for VAT. G/L accounts stored as tax accounts are always included in the processing. Entries with a control key are assigned to the fields in the form of the advance return for turnover tax according to the specifications made on the control key. Entries without a control key are only assigned to a field in the form of the advance return for VAT if the G/L account posted to has a corresponding assignment. The following procedure is recommended for setting up the advance return for VAT:Load/set up the form as a structure with identifier VAT_RETURN_REPORT. Setting up the control keys with assignment to the form fields Assignment of such G/L accounts to form fields that could possibly be posted to without a tax key: as a rule, all accounts whose values must be included as the tax base in the advance return for sales tax. Although one can assume that these accounts are always posted to with tax keys, one can build in further security here by assigning the entire account. However, you must be aware that all postings to an account marked in this way, which were posted without a tax key, will then always be assigned to this form field. However, such subsequent allocations are displayed in the list window as a system message and can thus be checked. Check whether all expense and revenue accounts in the G/L account master record are marked as such: otherwise the system could issue messages such as "Revenue account posted with input tax key Check whether accounts such as import VAT, which are not automatically posted with fixed percentages from gross postings, have been created as accounts of the type tax account. If this is not the case, the account type of the G/L account can be changed subsequently in the list window under the menu item "Edit" / "Change account type". When the advance return for sales tax is set up, the system automatically checks all postings of the selected period for possible errors or discrepancies. If any occur, they are displayed in the list System messages. Here is a brief overview of the logic of the checks:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "vatreturn" with the name "Advance turnover tax return (module)" regarding List window: The list window contains the totals view with the filled in form fields, a detailed view with the postings of the postings considered in the VAT advance return, a list of the balances of the accounts directly assigned to a field in the VAT advance return form and a list of the discrepancies detected by the system when creating the VAT advance return: these are displayed in the form of error or warning messages. After selecting the period and other options, one starts the evaluation by pressing a button in the toolbar. The system now reads in all bookings of the selected period and assigns them to the corresponding control fields. The status of the processing can be seen in the status bar. At the end of processing, the status line shows how many entries are in the detailed view with the bookings and how many were selected in it. If you switch to the detailed view with the bookings, you can navigate directly to the journal of the financial accounting by double-clicking on an entry in the list. With a right click you can display the total of selected entries. This is the description of the functionality of the module "vatreturn" with the name "Advance turnover tax return (module)" regarding Bookings (unstructured): In this window, entries are listed in an unstructured form (see also Journal (unstructured)) in order to be able to make any corrections to the allocation to tax accounts. This is the description of the functionality of the module "vatreturn" with the name "Advance turnover tax return (module)" regarding Option window: In this window, options for the structure of the advance return for VAT can be defined.

This is the description of the module "loggiprov" with the name "Staging (staging status) - staging from stock": In order to be able to deliver products to customers or to be able to produce in a manufacturing plant at all, it must be guaranteed that the parts required for this are available at the right place at the desired time: This is called provision. This module is used for the display/further processing of parts to be provided or already provided within the logistics supply chain in a company. On the one hand, it is possible to differentiate between external demand triggers (sales order items) or internal demand triggers (storage and production orders). (For further selection options according to storage bins or only open documents, see below) A provision must therefore be made not only for the dispatch of goods, but also within the company within the framework of production. To be provided: Depending on the logistical identification (purchased or manufactured part) and the type of provision (non-stock-keeping or stock-keeping with corresponding special forms such as JIT, etc.) of a part, parts are supplied to the logistical business process from Order requirements (for purchased parts not kept in stock) construction contracts (for production parts not kept in stock) or Storage reservations If the corresponding programme steps for provision are carried out, the documents affected by this, such as part requests, are automatically transferred to the next status: Provided: Analogous to the states of the parts to be provided, the following states result here Provided: Goods receipt Provided: Manufacturing Provided: Warehouse Provided: Shipping The state "dispatch" stands for those parts which are sent directly from the warehouse to dispatch for customer orders. (The part is kept in stock and the requirement trigger is a customer order) The programmatic execution of the provision from purchase requisitions - carried out by employees of the incoming goods department - and the provision from production orders - possibly carried out by employees of a final inspection - are not absolutely necessary, but they facilitate the control over the whereabouts of parts. The provision from stock reservations - carried out by employees of the warehouse - leads in the standard system to the creation of stock withdrawal documents (stock removal documents). In the case of KANBAN parts or special material withdrawals, staging is carried out in the same way as for warehouse reservations, but no goods withdrawal documents are created for these staging types. Instead, when the menu item "Create goods withdrawal from selected items" is selected, the selected items are immediately technically staged and a withdrawal slip is printed out. After a conversion of a production bill of materials, parts request items have the status "Return to stock". A putaway must be created for these documents in order to switch them to the final status "put away" and to clear them from the MRP account as planned receipts. See conversion parts lists. This is the description of the functionality of the module "loggiprov" with the name "Staging (staging status) - staging from stock" regarding List window: Depending on the selection of the staging status (see above under description) and the other selection options, the pegged requirements of parts are displayed. The button "Order" can be switched to "Stock order", "Prod.Order" or "Advance requirements". In the field to the right of the button you can then enter the corresponding number of the order to get all pegged requirements for this selected order in the list. If the search is initiated without entering a number, all pegged requirements for the selected status are displayed. (The search is also triggered by pressing the OK button) At the "Fert.Order" there is the additional possibility to enter the item number in order to display only the pegged requirements for a certain item. If the item is not found in the production order or no item is entered, all pegged requirements of the "Prod.Order" for the selected status are displayed. The parts required for a selected job are always displayed. Therefore you should not be misled by the fact that e.g. when selecting for a production order and selecting states of production (Make available from production order or Make available from production) only production orders are displayed which are sub orders of the selected production order (and not the selected production order itself). The "Only open quantities" box is enabled by default to display only the open requirements. The box "Order items" selects (customer) order items as pegged requirements. The box "Production documents" selects exploded parts list items (from sales and stock orders) as pegged requirements. In the "Cost Center" field, you can select the cost center that causes the demand. If no selection is made, all cost centres are displayed. The"Stock" User Box is displayed only when it is a staging condition of stocked parts. If "all warehouses" is specified, there is no selection by warehouse, if "only selected warehouses" there is a selection by the warehouses specified to the right of it (in the standard system all warehouses are preselected), if "no selected warehouses" is specified, exactly the selected warehouses are omitted. For the check the warehouse defined in the document is used, if this is not defined the main warehouse from the logistics account of the part is used. Special features of the staging list:.

This is the description of the module "cxDataConnector" with the name "Data connector (AppsWarehouse modules)": Data connectors form the link between the database and reports. The data connectors define possible data fields, which can also contain complex logic, and commands for loading all objects of a data connector. Reports, in turn, are based on these and use only a subset of the fields of the data connector and can filter the data. In special cases a report can also define new data fields or overwrite the commands for loading the data. While reports are intended for the end user and are used, for example, for individual lists, the data connectors are of a technical nature and not intended for direct use by end users. Data connectors can either be defined manually or created automatically from the data in a database using the Web Crawler object. The latter has the advantage that the data connectors then represent exactly the data in the database. The Web Crawler object and its logic are described on a separate page. There is a distinction between main data connectors and auxiliary data connectors. Main data connectors are created by the Web Crawler object only for main objects. Main objects are mainly objects of a REP. This logic is further refined by a blacklist and a whitelist. For more information, please see the page of the object Web Crawler. Auxiliary data connectors are created for all objects that are found but are not main objects. These do not appear in the lists of data connectors, they are only used for navigation in the apps that display data connectors and their links.

This is the description of the module "salesItemOrderStatisticsList" with the name "Sales of sales items": This module is used to create statistics on sales items. For this purpose, all the items of sales orders are evaluated in which all forms of sales items - within level 0 - have been ordered.Only those order items whose order header is confirmed are included in the statistics. Unconfirmed orders are ignored in the statistics! In addition to sales order items, parts from intercompany orders are also taken into account, but only if parts and not parts roles have been called (see next section).To call up the statistics, you can differentiate between the part selection and the part role selection. With part selection, all the roles of the selected parts specified in the filter for part roles are included in the statistics. If only individual sub-roles of individual parts are selected, only these appear in the statistics.Note! These sales order statistics are intended purely as sales item quantity, value and contribution margin statistics, they are not billing turnover statistics that can be directly matched to the accrual periods in financial accounting . The period accrual in these sales item statistics is based only on the statistics period set on the respective order header. This is the description of the functionality of the module "salesItemOrderStatisticsList" with the name "Sales of sales items" regarding List window: The parts/part roll selection is done via the toolbar button . When you click on it, a sub-menu appears, which offers the selection by parts directly or parts rolls. After selecting the parts, the creation of the statistics starts automatically. The part roll is only displayed in the list if instead of a part its roll(s) has been selected directly via the part roll selection. If parts are selected directly, the values are output over all its roles. If only the time period is changed after the statistics have been created, the new determination can be started for the previously selected parts/part rolls via the toolbar button can be restarted. In order to also output the contribution margins of the order items summed up according to parts (e.g. for a contribution margin analysis of e.g. spare parts), the option "List format DB analysis" can be activated via the options window, which also lists various contribution margins (against target and actual costs). However, this option can slow down the build-up of the statistics - especially when a large number of parts are involved. Attention! The validity of parts is not considered in these statistics, i.e. quantities/values across exchange objects are not displayed! Using a list once created, the displayed parts can be dragged into the parts precalculation list. A preliminary costing can then be carried out for each selected part. Attention: If the option "Split variant parts" was selected, one line appears in the list for each variant part. If all lines are selected, several preliminary costings are created for the same part in the preliminary part costing!. This is the description of the functionality of the module "salesItemOrderStatisticsList" with the name "Sales of sales items" regarding Option window: The following display settings can be specified in the options window:.

Frequently, packaging is made available to the buyer free of charge, so it is necessary to keep a record of how many packages have been delivered or possibly collected, when and with what. With this module of AppsWarehouse® such packaging accounts (e.g. as pallet accounts) can be managed. An emballage account can either be assigned to a partner (e.g. customer or supplier) or to an emballage (e.g. pallet or crate) as account owner. If the account owner of an emballage account is, for example, a customer, this customer can in turn maintain so-called sub-accounts for different emballages: one sub-account for e.g. europallets, another sub-account for e.g. cable drums. Conversely, the partners are assigned to each part of the packaging account as sub-accounts: e.g. the packaging account for Euro pallets holds the customers to whom the goods were delivered on pallets as sub-accounts.

This is the description of the module "qm_formula_qm" with the name "Formula Object (CX_FORMULA)": This is used to check the formula calculation for transient/persistent objects for correct function. At the bottom of the window there are two buttons. The button 'Test' lets you run through some formulas quickly one after the other and compares the calculated results with the expected values. The button 'Random Test' lets you endlessly run through a few randomly selected formulas and compares the values. The three text fields show the formula to be calculated at the top, the internal formula format in the middle and the calculated result at the bottom. Under the menu item 'Test', 'Test Export' defines some formula examples with which the multilingual capability can be tested. If one selects an example here and then activates another language with the menu 'Language', units etc. should also change the language. With button 'start', formulas are evaluated and the result is checked. To prove not only the correctnes of formula evaluation but also the stability of the algorithms involved, formulas are evaluated in random order.

This is the description of the module "worldClock" with the name "World Clock": This module allows to calculate the current time in another location (related to a specific location). Not only different time zones, but also summer and winter time (if available) are taken into account. In addition, it is shown whether and what kind of public holiday takes place at the respective location. This is the description of the functionality of the module "worldClock" with the name "World Clock" regarding Example:: It is chosen as the location "Hamburg" and as the comparative location "Los Angeles". The time zone difference here is 9 hours. If "4.7.1996" is now selected as the date and "17.00" as the time, the time difference remains unchanged, as daylight saving time applies in both countries. This means that the clock of the place of comparison shows "8.00 o'clock". It also indicates that this day is a public holiday in "Los Angeles", namely "Independence Day". This is the description of the functionality of the module "worldClock" with the name "World Clock" regarding Selection of a location: When the application is started, the location currently set on the system is determined and transferred to the field for the own location. All available countries are entered in the field for the comparison location. To select another location, open the box and click on another location. Only locations that belong to the same superordinate location are available for selection. If, on the other hand, a subordinate or superordinate location is to be selected, the arrow keys are to be used. If one of the buttons is not available, this means that no superior or subordinate location exists. This is the description of the functionality of the module "worldClock" with the name "World Clock" regarding Example:: Los Angeles" is to be selected as the reference site. First, open the User Box to display the list of available countries in the comparison location field. Now "USA" can be selected. To get to the state level of the USA press the arrow key"ß". Opening the box again will list all (available) states of the USA. After selecting "California" and pressing"ß" again, all counties/cities of California are displayed. From this list, "Los Angeles" can now be selected. This is the description of the functionality of the module "worldClock" with the name "World Clock" regarding Exceptional case:: In the case of locations that extend over several time zones (e.g. the USA), the corresponding clock disappears because no time zone is clearly selected. A message indicating this appears in the status bar at the bottom of the window. After selecting a location that is located in only one time zone, the corresponding clock is displayed again. This is the description of the functionality of the module "worldClock" with the name "World Clock" regarding Selection of a time: The application does not necessarily refer to the current time, but makes it possible to specify any time. In this way, questions such as "If I am in London at 15.00 on 7.9.96, what time is it in New York, and is it a public holiday in one of the two places?" can be answered. To change the time, simply set a new time in the corresponding fields for the time and date. If you want to set the current time or date again, press the corresponding button. This is the description of the functionality of the module "worldClock" with the name "World Clock" regarding consideration of summer and winter time: The application takes into account the changeover time to summer or winter time at a location. If, for example, the time difference between "Hamburg" and "Los Angeles" is calculated on "1.2.96", it is 9 hours, but on "1.4.96" it is 10 hours, since on this day in Germany it has already been changed to daylight saving time (one hour ahead), but not yet in the USA. The time valid at the respective location is displayed ("summer time", "winter time"). If the time is not changed at that location, this is indicated by "normal time". This is the description of the functionality of the module "worldClock" with the name "World Clock" regarding Display of public holidays: For each of the two locations, it is shown whether there is a public holiday at that location at the time shown for that location. This is the description of the functionality of the module "worldClock" with the name "World Clock" regarding World Clock Module: The core of the "World Clock" consists of the calculation of the difference between two global dates, i.e. dates that also have a time zone specification. The class CX_GLOBAL_TERM is available for this purpose. When calculating the time difference between two locations, however, an existing summer and winter time should also be taken into account. This information is kept in the location data as a periodic date in form of an object of the class CX_PERIODIC_DATE. This means that the date of the summer time changeover does not have to be specified for each year, but is held as a formula. In Germany, for example, the changeover to summer time is usually made on the "last Sunday in March". The exact changeover time for a particular year is returned by the system as an object of class CX_TERM. Of course, the starting point does not have to be the same as your own location. To access data from a specific location, it only needs to be stored in an object of the classes CX_LOCALE, CX_STATE_LOCALE or CX_COUNTRY_LOCALE to allow access. Even a (temporary) exchange of the system location with another location is no problem. In this way it can be determined whether a holiday is taking place at the comparison location.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions that a user might ask when using the "World Clock" module, based on the provided description:

1. What is the current time in Los Angeles compared to Hamburg?
2. Is today a public holiday in Los Angeles?
3. If I choose "London" as my location, how does the time difference compare to "New York"?
4. Can I select a specific date and time to see how it compares to another location?
5. Does the module take into account daylight saving time when calculating time differences?
6. How do I access the list of available countries in the comparison location field?
7. Can I filter the list of states or cities in the USA by a specific criteria, such as population size or geographic region?
8. What is the format of the date and time displayed for each location?
9. Can I reset the time and date to the current values for my system?
10. Are there any limitations to the number of locations I can compare simultaneously?

I hope these questions cover the main functionalities of the "World Clock" module! Let me know if you need further assistance.

This is the description of the module "stockOrder" with the name "Stock order": Internal orders are most often created as stock orders in order to increase the production parts in stock. However, they are also used to order reproductions for sales order items or generally for cost objects/projects (work orders). This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockOrder" with the name "Stock order" regarding Internal: If it is necessary to reprocess a possibly already delivered sales order, a stock order can be created with a concatenation to the corresponding order item or the superior sales order. For this, only the order predecessor has to be selected on a newly created stock order item and (important for the subsequent creation of delivery notes) the type "subsequent delivery" has to be set. Now the stock order can be exploded and the production parts list can be adapted to the work to be carried out. In the exploded BOM, parts can now be added and a special routing can be selected that contains only the work sequences required for rework. All required parts are added to the BOM. The stock order item is then not put into stock after the completion of the subsequent production order, but is made available for this order. In this way it is possible to remanufacture parts of an order item (BOM level > 0) that may have broken during assembly at the construction site and then re-deliver them to the construction site via a delivery note. The costs for this stock order are then linked to the linked order item or linked order header for the final costing/order cost evaluation. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockOrder" with the name "Stock order" regarding Internal: If the storage order is only an internal work order (type=storage order), which is neither to be produced for a sales order item nor to be put into storage, the check mark "No goods putaway" must be set on the storage order item. Now a project, e.g. "Maintenance of the production lines" can be created and assigned to this stock order header. To do this, simply set the tick "Cost object assignment". Now either an existing project can be selected or by leaving the project field empty a new project can be created for this storage order. However, this is not absolutely necessary. The decisive factor is the tick "No goods putaway" on the storage order item. Stock orders that are neither assigned to a project or sales order nor have the check mark "No goods putaway" on the items are put away after completion of the production order. It is not possible to assign a stock order item to a sales order and at the same time uncheck the box "No goods putaway". This would mean that the costs of this warehouse order are assigned to the sales order, but the goods are put into storage at the customer's disposal. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockOrder" with the name "Stock order" regarding Internal order for the execution of rework: This type of order is used to define the rework for customer orders. You must select the order type "internal order" and the checkbox Rework. You can enter this order manually or create it using the "Rework Wizzad". With the Wizzard you only have to enter the old production order or job ticket, the finish dates and quantity. The system takes over the technical release and the creation of part request and production order for you. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockOrder" with the name "Stock order" regarding Internal: Deliveries to a branch or other establishment may not be recorded as a customer order because they must not affect the balance sheet, i.e. the value of the order may not be recognised as internal company turnover For this reason, it does not make sense to enter intercompany orders via sales orders. The warehouse orders are also suitable for this purpose. On the warehouse order, Intercompany can be selected as the "type" and a company with an address can be specified as the recipient. The data from the warehouse order header is copied to each new item. By filling in the recipient, the warehouse order item also receives the delivery status in addition to the MRP status, which means that it can be found in the picking list via its date (delivery or staging date). After disposition, the warehouse order item changes - like a sales order item - to the status: Ready for dispatch. Now it is clear that it still has to be shipped. Stock orders that are created and scheduled for replenishment of the warehouse are in the status: "Ready: Production" and must be put into storage. Attention! If stock-managed parts are included in the warehouse order for a subsequent delivery, complaint or intercompany type, these warehouse order items are posted to the status "warehouse reservation" and must be withdrawn (staged) from the warehouse via the picking list, just like order items! Subsequently, the delivery note is also created from here. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockOrder" with the name "Stock order" regarding Internal order as production planning (PPL): Production planning is used to replenish and plan the stock of purchased and manufactured parts. The planning is carried out in two stages:.

This is the description of the module "resset" with the name "Resource Plan": Resource plans are predefined combinations of resources (parts, workstations, machines, workgroups or work areas) that are used in project networks to speed up planning. Resources can be put together as a sequence of individual and/or variant items. Single item Variant position A line item contains a resource that is required in the specified (constant or calculated) quantity. A variant item is a conditional list of basic headings. When the resource plan is exploded (if it is used in a project network), the (single) item whose condition is first fulfilled is used. This is the description of the functionality of the module "resset" with the name "Resource Plan" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain resource plans. You can select a resource plan by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If several resource plans with the number exist, the selection window is displayed and you can select the required resource plan. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". If you create a new resource plan, you must save it before you can add items to it. The creation date and user are preset and can be changed. Before you use a resource plan (which contains conditional items or calculated/conditional quantities), you should test it (Test Resolution). You can also "sort positions" in the "Positions" submenu: There the positions of the current resource plan are sorted by position number. This is the description of the functionality of the module "resset" with the name "Resource Plan" regarding Resource plan display: In the resource plan editing mask there are two possibilities to visualise the resource plan. On the one hand the display as an assembly resource plan, in which only the items of the first level are shown. In addition, the variants checkbox can be used to display the characteristics of the superiors. The resource plan positions can be edited with the button can be displayed in the tree view.

This is the description of the module "specifier" with the name "Prefixes": With this application you can create, make persistent and then maintain prefixes (specifiers). One must be aware that only persistent specifiers can and may be changed. Therefore, you have to create a transient specifier at runtime and make it persistent before you can change it. Transient specifiers of the ClassiX® system, i.e. specifiers that are loaded from the *.DIC and *.INI files when the system is started, must neither be changed nor made persistent. Once created and made persistent, Specifiers can no longer be deleted. Specifiers that have been created and made transient cannot be deleted either, but they will not be present the next time the system is started. Making specifiers persistent can only be done from the list window, this is a security measure. For example, if you have created several transient specifiers and don't want to keep one of them, you can make the specifiers you want to keep persistent, restart the system and then only the persisted specifiers will be available. The created transient specifier will no longer be displayed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "specifier" with the name "Prefixes" regarding List window: This list shows all prefixes available in the system. This is the description of the functionality of the module "specifier" with the name "Prefixes" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select a prefix.

This is the description of the module "loggidac" with the name "Disposition account (demand forecast)": The documents posted in the MRP account and certain data from the logistics account are displayed. In principle, only those open documents that represent planned departures or receipts should be posted in the MRP account (for example: open planned receipt: requirement request item not yet (completely) ordered, production order item not yet reported as finished, etc.; open planned retirement: order item not yet (completely) delivered, part requirement item not yet (completely) withdrawn, etc.). Based on the current stock level, the documents in the MRP account represent the future (planned) stock development in the date sequence. The stock level can fall below the minimum stock level for the respective part at any one time or even become negative. Such situations (minimum stock shortage, reorder point) are analysed in the requirements and stock list (see also date control). Attention - Irregularity with exceeded deadlines via the SCM module: When checking dates in SCM (missing parts list), note that planned receipt documents that are scheduled earlier than today and have not yet arrived are automatically scheduled as a "tomorrow" date! If an order was scheduled for 6.2.2012 and has a purchase order with the same date, but today is 7.2.2012 and the purchase order has not yet arrived, then the order is classified as a missing part and receives the shortage indicator in the MRP account. This item also appears in SCM as a missing part! (Technical note: If the variables checkInPastActivated and checkInPastGenerallyActivated are set to TRUE in SetOptions, this control is also active in the normal MRP account and the B&B list with schedule control). The disposition account can also be called up for individual company codes. Requirement triggers in the MRP account (requirement triggers reduce the stock): Project reservations with the status "started Order items Advance requirementsPart requirements (dispositions) Stock Reserves Coverage of requirements in the dispo account (coverage of requirements increases the stock) Unordered requisitions Orders Stock orders Production orders Although documents such as goods receipts increase stock, they will never be seen in the MRP account because they do not represent a future movement but already reduce stock when the document is posted. Parts consumption and parts sales The dispatch account also shows how often the part has been used in the last year. For consumption, quantities are added up on transaction data in a certain period. The movement data includes goods withdrawals, goods receipts and direct deliveries not put into storage and production orders not put into storage. For Kanban parts, other evidence for the evaluation of consumption is included, namely the confirmed order items and the further processed part request items of the part. For Kanban parts it is not possible to use the two arrows to switch to the parts consumption overview in addition to the parts consumption, as the parts consumption for Kanban parts does not appear in this overview. Consumption from order items can be viewed via the sales item turnover display. The other consumptions via processed parts request items can only be viewed via the operation folder of the part. This is the description of the functionality of the module "loggidac" with the name "Disposition account (demand forecast)" regarding Sorting the documents: The shortfall analysis depends on the assumption of when and "how certain" the deadlines are. For example, if the dates are given as a time span, the "true" date can be determined by making the appropriate selection. Three sorting modes are provided to allow different views of the inventory development: If required from part requests (departure date), the planned date is composed of the earliest and latest start, which also results in a time span. With the evaluation type "Strict", the earliest date of this time span is always used for the evaluation, with the setting "Medium" exactly the middle and with "Soft" the end of the time span, i.e. there is the least buffer for the real demand. If planning (e.g. stock replenishment) is always to be carried out with a little air, the setting "Medium" is recommended, which is always set in the standard system. However, if there is little space in the warehouse or if the warehouse budget is always to be kept as low as possible, the setting "Soft" is recommended, whereby planning is always carried out on the actual demand date. Strictly means, therefore, that the goods are always already procured at the earliest possible date and may also lie in the warehouse for some time until they are needed, depending on how large the buffer times of the requirements were. Example (opening stock = 0 pieces): (Week 13, 2002: Mon=25.03., Tue=26.03., Wed=27.03., Thu=28.03., Fri=29.03., Sat=30.03., Sun=31.03.) Strict: Ordered goods are always late: Medium: first order comes too late: Soft: everything is fine: The document list cannot be sorted manually. 
Sure, I'd be happy to assist! Here are some potential questions based on the provided module description:

1. How many days before the due date must a purchase order arrive to avoid triggering a shortage indicator in the MRP account?
2. Can I view the consumption history of a particular part in the disposition account? If so, how?
3. What is the difference between the three sorting modes offered in the disposition account (strict, medium, soft)?
4. How does the system determine the true date for evaluating deadlines in the shortfall analysis?
5. Is it possible to sort the documents in the MRP account manually? If not, what criteria does the system use to sort the documents?
6. How does the system handle irregularities with exceeded deadlines through the SCM module?
7. Can I view the coverage of requirements in the disposition account? If so, how?
8. Are there any specific settings or configurations that need to be made in order to use the disposition account properly?
9. How does the system evaluate part consumption in the disposition account? Does it consider all transactions, or just certain types of transactions?
10. Can I filter the documents in the MRP account by specific criteria, such as document type or material?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "loggidac" with the name "Disposition account (demand forecast)" regarding Display of the current balance; balance check: The balance is carried forward into the future from the quantity available today (available stock + quantity received). The balance is increased with each planned receipt and decreased with each planned issue. Each time the MRP account window is activated, a balance control procedure is automatically performed for the part. During the check the result of the master calculation formula "AVAILABLE_QUANTITY" (the formula is defined to calculate the "ideal" available quantity of a part, based on data from the stock and MRP account; e.g: Warehouse stock + stock order + In production + Requested + Ordered + GR quantity + QA quantity - In order - Reserved) compared to the calculated final balance (the last balance in the document list). If the results are different, an error message about the difference is displayed; the difference is also shown in red below the list. It is important to note that the last column on the far right displays the MRP type with which a sales order or gozo item was posted to the MRP account, whether, for example, as a warehouse reservation or as a production order or requisition. This is particularly important if you have stock reservations listed in the B&B list for parts that currently no longer have the staging type, e.g. stock management. Then you can simply find out the document in the corresponding MRP account that was reserved in stock! If the option "Split variants" is set (see option window), and the part is a variant part, no balance is displayed, but the currently used variation of the variant part. See also variant filter. This is the description of the functionality of the module "loggidac" with the name "Disposition account (demand forecast)" regarding Display of the last parts sales: Above the list is another group. It shows the parts sales of the last 12, 6, 3 and the current month. The button on the right-hand side takes you directly to the parts turnover statistics. There the part is automatically selected and the sales of the last 12 months are displayed in detail. This is the description of the functionality of the module "loggidac" with the name "Disposition account (demand forecast)" regarding Variant filter: If the displayed part is a variant part and the option "Split variants" is activated, the corresponding quantities are split in the interim/stock and dispatch quantity lists according to the variation that has occurred. Above these lists there is a small button with a magnifying glass, which opens these lists enlarged. This also allows sorting by variation or individual characteristics. If you double click on one of the lists, a filter is set on the document list, which corresponds to the clicked variation. Only documents with the same variation are displayed in the document list. The documents responsible for the clicked quantity are also marked. This filter can be changed via the Refresh toolbar button again. If the parts consumption list is opened with a filter set in this way, the filter is transferred and now also applies in the parts consumption list. This is the description of the functionality of the module "loggidac" with the name "Disposition account (demand forecast)" regarding Option window: Menu Menu item Description Edit - : Reset default settings Sets and displays the default settings defined via the module. This is the description of the functionality of the module "loggidac" with the name "Disposition account (demand forecast)" regarding Overview of variants: In the dispo account of a variant part, or one of its subparts, there is the possibility to display all subparts of the variant part and itself in a clear list with all its stock and dispo quantities one below the other. By double-clicking on an entry, the MRP account for the selected part is called up, but the list remains in the foreground so that it is easier to click through all the MRP accounts one after the other. By right-clicking on the list, the minimum, reporting and maximum stocks of the subparts can be changed directly in the list. This is the description of the functionality of the module "loggidac" with the name "Disposition account (demand forecast)" regarding Technical Documentation: FindCritical Date (FindCriticalMoment ) Call: SendMsg(FIND_CRITICAL_MOMENT) The method FindCriticalMoment can be used for two purposes, whereby the way it behaves is determined according to the transfer parameter. On the one hand, you can check whether a planned retirement is possible on a certain date and what effects this retirement has on the subsequent planning movements. The parameters checkQuantity and checkDate are absolutely necessary. The sorting parameter only evaluates the hard, medium or soft data(see above). Further specifications such as checkToDateLevel have no influence on this method. What makes the functions? First of all, the test output is sorted into the dispositive movements. This is done on the basis of the date. Then all operations are run through (simulated) once and the effect of the stock change through the test dispatch is analysed. The result of this test is the return code. What evidence has an influence on the outcome? Examples: Furthermore, this method can be used to check whether and when a minimum stock shortage occurs for a part. This information is also taken from the MRP account. This method makes sense when creating the requirements and stock list. As return parameters you also get a returnCode and a returnContainer. The returnCode determines the type of underrun. Except in the case that the returnCode is 0 (all o.k.) or 16 (ERROR) the returnContainer contains the following information:.

10. How does the "loggidac" module integrate with other modules or systems in the company's IT infrastructure to support quality assurance processes?

This is the description of the module "inventry" with the name "Inventory": This app supports the recording of current inventories (so-called stock corrections) as well as annual inventories in the form of one-time or permanent inventories. Since an inventory is supposed to represent a comparison/check of the (book) stocks in the DP system with the actual stocks in the warehouse, inventories are initially generated from data in the DP. In combination with the inventory analysis app, inventory sampling is also supported. Inventories are an important part of monthly and annual financial statements. As part of accounting, inventories are subject to strict organisational guidelines. This is the description of the functionality of the module "inventry" with the name "Inventory" regarding Structure: There are 5 different ways of setting up an inventory: The following generally applies to the selection: If a part is invalid but still has stock in one of its storage bins, it is included in the inventory. If there is no stock quantity, an invalid part is not included in the inventory. By default, when an inventory is set up, the average price of a part in a warehouse is copied into the inventory document. This value can be subsequently changed in the inventory manually or by programme run. The date, value and quantity of the last inventory are also written to the new inventory document when the inventory is set up. This data can be viewed and further evaluated in the inventory analysis. Instead of creating a single inventory document with all storage bins, it can also make sense to create several inventory documents subdivided according to different storage bin areas. In the latter case, while an inventory document is still being counted in one storage bin area, the count of another storage bin area that has already been counted can be recorded and posted in the separate inventory document and then this storage bin area can be released. By means of the inventory analysis, it is nevertheless possible to obtain an overview of several inventories. Duplicate inventory items (same part, same storage bin) are generally not permitted by the system. This is the description of the functionality of the module "inventry" with the name "Inventory" regarding Count: After creating the inventory document, a count list can be printed with which the actual count or inventory can then be carried out in the warehouse. Once the actual counted stocks have been entered in the count list, they are subsequently recorded in the inventory document. The counted stocks can be entered manually via the count list or via a mobile data entry station (MDE). This is the description of the functionality of the module "inventry" with the name "Inventory" regarding Reconciliation and posting: After reconciliation of the counted stocks and the EDP book stocks, the inventory document is posted. Depending on whether a stock correction is desired or not, either only the difference is posted or the counted quantity is also saved in the system as a stocktaking quantity with date. Posted inventories can no longer be edited subsequently. The valuation on the inventory item is used to recalculate the moving average price. This valuation is taken from the currently valid average price of the part when the inventory item is created. More on this topic in the chapter "Determining the new average price". When posting, the posting of the items is divided into individual steps. This is necessary for very long inventories of many parts, otherwise the database is blocked too long for other users. If posting is interrupted, it can happen that individual items have already been properly posted, but others have not yet been posted. You can recognise the complete inventory posting as usual by the posting date on the inventory header document and the blocked posting button. As long as this is not locked, the inventory is not completely posted. This is the description of the functionality of the module "inventry" with the name "Inventory" regarding Input window: This window is used to enter and maintain inventories. You can select an inventory by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". There are three views (details are described in the options window ): The count list hides all fields that represent the current stock in the ClassiX® system so that the count result is not influenced by the target quantity. These include: When posting, all totals are calculated automatically. A currency table valid for the inventory can be created at the inventory header. This is the description of the functionality of the module "inventry" with the name "Inventory" regarding Position window: This window is used to maintain the inventory items. The quickest way to enter the inventory is to jump to the next / previous item with the arrow keys 'up' and 'down' after entering the values for an item. The data is automatically saved when you switch. If you select the Close button, no data is written to the database. The display and maintenance of the fields depends on the display options. This is the description of the functionality of the module "inventry" with the name "Inventory" regarding List window: Used to search and list inventories. This is the description of the functionality of the module "inventry" with the name "Inventory" regarding Sorting window: In this window, special sorting criteria can be made to sort the displayed items in the list.

5. Are there any restrictions on who can access the inventory analysis feature, or is it open to all authorized users?
6. Can the module perform automatic reconciliation between the counted stocks and the EDP book stocks, or must this step be done manually?
7. How does the module prevent unauthorized changes to posted inventories?
8. Can the valuation on inventory items be updated manually, or is it solely determined by the moving average price?
9. Can the posting process be paused and resumed later without affecting the integrity of the inventory data?
10. How does the position window allow for the maintenance of inventory items, specifically in regards to editing their details?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "inventry" with the name "Inventory" regarding Draw number of samples: From this window, a freely definable number of samples can be taken from the inventory items in the inventory document currently being processed. After drawing the sample, only the items that were drawn by sample remain in the inventory document. The remaining items are removed from the display and kept in the inventory document as a noted item for the items originally present in the inventory document. You can therefore always select new samples from the noted item. This is the description of the functionality of the module "inventry" with the name "Inventory" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select an inventory. This is the description of the functionality of the module "inventry" with the name "Inventory" regarding Mobile data acquisition: This window is adapted in size and functionality to a mobile data collection station. The information such as inventory/line or storage location/article number should be scanned in order to only have to enter the counted quantity directly at the station. This is the description of the functionality of the module "inventry" with the name "Inventory" regarding Options window: Here, among other things, all settings for the search can be made. The window can only be closed by pressing the "OK" button. Once options have been set, they can be saved as default options for the logged-in user. For this purpose, there is a context menu entry on the "Preferences" tab in the "User preferences" list, which can be used to save the current options. This is the description of the functionality of the module "inventry" with the name "Inventory" regarding Determination of the new average price:: The determination of the new average price for parts when posting an inventory is done as follows: When creating inventory items, the current average prices are written to the document as the "old average price" and as the new valuation, as well as the current stock level of the selected storage bin as the SET quantity. Calculations are then carried out when posting: (Current total stock * current average price ) + (valuation * counted quantity storage bin) - (old average price * TARGET quantity-storage bin). / current stock quantity + counted quantity storage bin - SET quantity storage bin current average price unit of measure If a part now has stock in several storage bins, the new value will also only change the average price proportionally according to the new total stock. It is then not taken over 1:1 For a simplified explanation If the part only has one storage bin, the formula could be simplified somewhat: The first part of the formula is omitted because the SET quantity of the storage bin is the current stock and the old average price is the current average price: (valuation * count quantity-storage bin) / Quantity counted Current average price unit Example: The receipt shows a valuation of 10€/1piece. The quantity counted is 10 pieces. The value indicated on the inventory item is therefore taken over 1:1 as the new average price: Valuation * counted quantity == 100 EUR / counted quantity (10 pieces) = 10 EUR/piece Per denominator of current average price = 10 EUR / 1pc.

This is the description of the module "legalPersonDuplicatesList" with the name "Company duplicate lists": When duplicate matching, the name is split up according to the spaces and line breaks and searched for these in the company master data using wildcards. For companies found in this way, the name is not checked, only the country, town and street. If the street in the found company does not contain the term "P.O. Box" in the checked company or vice versa, the company is considered to be the same so that a manual check can be carried out. In addition, the sales tax identification number is also checked. The check is carried out in the input mask before saving if the automatic check at save is set in the options. Examples of duplicates: Why is this a duplicate? Name Country Place Street/Postal Box The name is similar, the town is the same and in one field "street" there is the word "post office box University sample EN Samples Zülpicherstr. 45 University of Model Central EN Samples PO box 41 09 24 The location of one address appears in the other address The system knows the abbreviation "str." and thus recognises that it is the same street.

This is the description of the module "itemDispositionEdit" with the name "Parts Disposition": With this module, released (order-specific) production parts lists are selected before or for the creation of a gozintograph and combined to a common production lot/order network. The button "Select orders" lists the possible customer orders, stock orders and preliminary requirements. Identical or similar parts, which are also on schedule, can now be selected - even across orders - as one production lot, for which a single, common gozintograph is then generated. At the moment, customer orders, stock orders and advance requirements cannot be planned together. For example, several sales order items or stock order items may be combined, but not, for example, a sales order item and a preliminary requirements item. Although the actual further processing of the gozintograph generated in this way takes place in the"Parts request" module, optional specifications for the automated further processing of the gozintograph can already be made in this parts scheduling module: Automatic determination of the disposition type, the procurement time and execution of a first parts scheduling as forward or backward scheduling. During the automatic construction of the gozintograph, variant parts are checked again to see if the feature bar is fully developed. If this is not the case, the construction of the Gozintograph is aborted. (A corresponding "Test Create Gozintograph" can be carried out in advance). In the case of variant parts, a new attempt is also made to find a suitable lower part: if this is successful, the variant part is replaced by the lower part in the gozintograph. The gozintograph is built up in two phases, the progress of which is shown in the bottom status line of the mask: Phase: Sorting the parts lists according to parts and production stages Phase: Building the Gozintograph Important note: Basically all parts of the selected production parts lists are transferred to the Gozintograph. There is, however, one exception: If BOM items have been marked as"constructive assembly" in the master data, these entries will be read over, only the parts underneath (= the BOM items of the BOM item marked as constructive assembly) will be included in the Gozintograph - increased by one production level or decreased by one disposition level. Although in the modules for BOM maintenance the indicator"constructive assembly" can only be set if the part is an MRP production part, this is checked again in phase 2: The identification"constructive assembly" is ignored exactly if a part is no longer an MRP production part. This is the description of the functionality of the module "itemDispositionEdit" with the name "Parts Disposition" regarding Input window: With 'Order' the window 'Completed and exploded parts lists' opens. After you have entered an order number, all items of the order are listed which have been successfully exploded. You can then select individual lines in the list or all lines via the menu item 'Edit - Positions - Select positions'. Copy the marked positions with 'OK' or by drag & drop into the window 'Part disposition'. This processing window is thus used to compile all the order or advance requirement items that are jointly transferred to production as a collective order. All common parts of this collective order are then planned, scheduled and further processed together in the gozintograph. This is the description of the functionality of the module "itemDispositionEdit" with the name "Parts Disposition" regarding Create a test Gozinto: Before creating a gozintograph, some checks can be made to ensure that it is suitable for further processing: In addition to the tests carried out prior to the creation of a gozintograph, the tests carried out when the gozintograph is created are also carried out, and if they are unsuccessful they always lead to termination: A double click on a result entry in the list opens directly the editing mask of the parts list item!. This is the description of the functionality of the module "itemDispositionEdit" with the name "Parts Disposition" regarding Option window: All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed with the "OK" button. Gozintograph: In the parts master, various logistics indicators were assigned to the parts. During materials planning, the parts are then broken down according to the rules defined. When production orders are cancelled, the parts are reported to the relevant work processes in accordance with their identification as production parts, purchased parts or externally produced parts. The production planning department receives the production parts for a cross-order summary. All purchase requisitions for purchased parts appear in the purchase folder and the stock lists report the demand for stock parts. The individual types of disposition are divided here into You can then instruct the first production orders, requirement requests and warehouse reservations, which are created in the background by the system. With 'Delete' you can withdraw your orders etc. and with 'Stragglers' it is possible to create further production orders and requirement requests. The menu item 'Navigate' enables you to jump to the pre-created production order or to the requirement request. You can also return to the parts planning or view the use of the parts. Release parts request: Via the menu item 'Edit - Release part request' the corresponding instructions are finally forwarded to the following departments and the list 'Disposition levels' is deleted.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_lieferantenerklaerung" with the name "Supplier declaration - Processes" regarding General: Behind the keyword "supplier's declaration" is the obligation of the suppliers to make declarations on the origin of their goods. The declaration of origin is requested from the supplier by means of an origin enquiry. The supplier declaration module supports the creation of origin requests. For example, it determines which parts have to be requested from which suppliers. The A, B, C supplier identification, parts consumption, the purchase of parts from which suppliers, etc. are taken into account in order to create only the relevant origin enquiries. Once all the information has been gathered from all the suppliers of the ordered articles, this list can be printed out quickly using a report. The next step is now the preparation of the origin requests. This is done via a function call from the supplier declaration module, in which a request is created for each supplier with the relevant order articles. After the enquiries have been created, they can also be printed and sent immediately in one. The created enquiries are stored in the system and booked with the respective supplier, order item and clerk, so that they can be found easily and quickly at a later date. If a supplier then replies to an order enquiry of the type Proof of Origin or Supplier Declaration, the last applicable and still open (i.e. still inquired) order enquiry is selected via its transaction folder and the respective reply can then be entered for all, some or only individual order items. Finally, these answers can be written back to the supplier agreement for the ordered article at the push of a button from the order request window, i.e. updated. In the supplier agreement, origin indicators are provided with a validity and a history. In this way, it is also possible to issue an origin declaration for goods produced earlier. Since the origin requests are not deleted, they also provide a kind of history, which is not automatically evaluated.

The target costs are written to all items when the part request is released. The average price from the stock account is taken, if this is not available the standard price from the order reel or the material and labour costs from the production part reel. The actual costs for manual storage, JIT, KANBAN, etc. parts are also written to the items of the exploded production bill of materials when the parts request is released. It is also possible that the posting of target and actual costs is not carried out immediately. The costs are then not immediately posted to the document, but in a night run. A special feature is that the actual costs for manual stock, JIT, KANBAN, etc. parts are only written to the exploded parts list when the production order is reported complete. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_calculation" with the name "Calculation" regarding Data fields: The cost of the document for the calculation is written into each predecessor. In the transaction the documents for the calculation are collected in the collection"captured.transaction".

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_calculation" with the name "Calculation" regarding Distribution of costs: In the valuation of the unfinished products or the complete final costing, all costs are always booked as follows The costs will be added up on the following accounts: The document to be cleared is added to the document collections of the following accounts: Which data fields are written for which document can be seen in the table below. The costs can therefore always be viewed or evaluated per accrual period on the individual order sub-items, as well as on the order header and in total on the cost unit account. All costs for stock goods are divided into standard costs and overheads. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_calculation" with the name "Calculation" regarding General information on cost posting in the final costing: Determination of costs for storage and retrieval Goods receipts In the final costing, a negative value is always included in the valuation for goods receipts. Goods receipts to cost objects always represent a credit (= negative debit). If a withdrawal was posted for a cost object via a purchased part, then the purchased part was converted as a production part and then a goods receipt was created as a credit, the positive withdrawal value is still in the column purchased parts from stock, the negative goods receipt value is then in the column production parts from stock. Storage of level 0 parts of internal orders does not relieve the cost unit and does not appear in the final costing. Additional orders at level 0 Incoming invoices for additional orders at level 0 order items are not charged as merchandise but as purchased parts for production.

This is the description of the module "billofma" with the name "Parts lists": Parts lists describe the composition of a production part. A bill of material consists of parts, which in turn can have a bill of material. Each bill of material item describes which parts are required in which quantity for the production of a manufacturing part. There are two item types of a bill of material: Single item Variant item (conditional parts list item) The basic heading contains a part from the parts master that is required in the specified (constant or calculated) quantity. A variant item is a conditional list of single items. When exploding the bill of material, the (single) item whose condition is fulfilled first is used. If a subpart (of a variant part) is inserted into a bill of material, its characteristics are not automatically transferred, as these bills of material do not represent master data. During further processing of the parts list in orders or similar, the master data of the individual parts "shine through" and can then be changed later. This is the description of the functionality of the module "billofma" with the name "Parts lists" regarding Input window: This window is used for maintaining parts lists. You can select a parts list by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If several bills of material exist with the number, the selection window is displayed and you can select the desired bill of material. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". Enter a corresponding part-/drawing number and in the field 'Description' the name of the part. The creation date and the editor are predefined by the system and can be changed. Before you can add parts list items, a new parts list must be saved. Before you use a bill of material (which contains conditional items or calculated/conditional quantity specifications), you should test it (bill of material inspection). You can also "sort positions" in the "Positions" submenu: There the positions of the current parts list are sorted anew - according to a freely enterable and then ascending position number. This is the description of the functionality of the module "billofma" with the name "Parts lists" regarding Parts list display: If, in the list of parts list items, the symbol is output, then it is a part that is now valid as an exchange object of an originally inserted part object. In the parts list editing mask there are two possibilities for visualising the parts list. One is the display as a modular parts list, in which only the items of the first level are displayed. {img type="fileId" fileId="370" thumb="box" width="100%"} In addition, the entries of possible variant parts list items can be displayed via the variant checkbox. The parts list items can be selected with the button can be displayed in the tree view. Then the complete structure of the called up parts list is displayed - including all structures of the sub parts lists occurring in the parts list itself. This output is for viewing only, editing is (currently) not possible. The structured parts list can also be displayed in list form (radio button), for this purpose you can also specify the desired depth to which you want to track the parts lists. (The parts list report is only recommended in this list display) With the checkbox "also display invalid items" all items of the parts list can be displayed, i.e. also those on invalid set parts list items. With the button you can display the MRP product structure of the bill of material. This is the description of the functionality of the module "billofma" with the name "Parts lists" regarding Inspection parts list: You can check whether the parts list has been entered correctly via the menu item 'Parts list inspection'. The window 'Inspection Bill of Material' opens. Via 'Edit - Resolve' you can select the scope of the test and via 'Edit - Delete test resolutions' you can undo tests. If a parts list cannot be exploded, the system will display an error message. This is the description of the functionality of the module "billofma" with the name "Parts lists" regarding Renumber parts list items: This window is used to enter the information for a new numbering of the parts list items. This is the description of the functionality of the module "billofma" with the name "Parts lists" regarding List window: Serves on the one hand to list (headers) of parts lists and on the other hand as a starting point for listing and checking routines for parts list items. This is the description of the functionality of the module "billofma" with the name "Parts lists" regarding Bill of material items (across different bills of material): In this window, the positions of the parts lists previously selected in the list window are displayed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "billofma" with the name "Parts lists" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select a parts list. This is the description of the functionality of the module "billofma" with the name "Parts lists" regarding Option window: All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed with the "OK" button.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "billofma" with the name "Parts lists" regarding Parts list items (search results): If a search was carried out using set attributes, the positions to which the search applied are displayed here. A search for attributes applies if the subitem itself has the attribute you are looking for in any specified form, or if the subitem has a formula or conditional table as a quantity that contains this characteristic. For quantities as formulas or conditional values, the value of the characteristic is never checked. This means that if you search for LENGTH=34mm, a BOM/routing item is not displayed, even if it contains a quantity table with an entry LENGTH=34mm. Likewise, conditional BOM/routing items whose condition exactly matches the searched expression are not found. Only if this position also has the fixed attribute LENGTH=34mm, it will be found. So if you want to search all conditional entries and formulas for an attribute, you have to use the search on "available". A double click on an entry opens the editing mask of the position.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "Parts lists" functionality of the "billofma" module, based on the provided description:

1. How do I search for parts list items that match a specific attribute, such as LENGTH?
2. Can I search for parts list items that contain a specific formula or conditional value, such as LENGTH=34mm?

4. If I search for multiple attributes or formulas, how will the results be combined?
5. Can I filter the search results by specifying additional criteria, such as a specific part number or manufacturer?
6. Once I've performed a search, how can I view more detailed information about each position, such as its editable fields or attached documents?
7. Is there a way to quickly sort or group the search results based on specific criteria, such as attribute value or part number?
8. Can I save my search parameters so that I can easily reuse them later?
9. Are there any predefined searches or filters that I can use to quickly find specific types of parts list items?
10. How does the "Available" search option differ from the standard search option, and when would I use each one?

This is the description of the module "cxPurchaseReturn" with the name "Return receipt": Return documents can be created to return goods to suppliers. However, they are only used after the goods receipt PO has created a goods receipt document. Return documents are not created if the goods are rejected at goods receipt.In order to be able to carry out a supplier evaluation, several defect reasons can be given per item of a return document why the goods are returned in quantity(QS defects).In addition, it can be indicated on the return item how and whether a new delivery is to be made at all(instruction): Return for rework Return for new production Cancellation When a return document is created, the quantity is determined as follows: The delivery note quantity on the return item is the quantity originally stored on the goods receipt. This quantity cannot be changed here. The recorded return quantity also reduces the open QA quantity of the goods receipt if the part has been marked as a QA part.QS part: Open QA quantity can be returned and is entered as a default quantity in the return document when it is created. When saving, however, you also have the option of returning the entire quantity already released by QA that has neither been provided, returned or put into storage.Non-QS part: The goods receipt quantity is reduced by the quantity already provided, the quantity put away and any quantity already sent back. The quantity left over here is transferred to the return document as a proposal. The suggested quantity can no longer be increased for non-QA parts.Goods receipts can only be sent back by return document if this goods receipt has not yet been completely prepared. It is therefore the responsibility of the goods receipt department to create these return documents. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxPurchaseReturn" with the name "Return receipt" regarding Input window: This window is for maintaining return documents. You can select a return document by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search".

This is the description of the functionality of the module "printole" with the name "Printing with OLE (document printing)" regarding Description: This help gives you an overview of the printing options. This is the description of the functionality of the module "printole" with the name "Printing with OLE (document printing)" regarding Document modules: The document modules are the enveloping objects for the OLE objects. It has a multilingual name, number, type, OLE text and sub-modules. The type of a document block determines the order in which it is printed (see Order in which document blocks are printed). A document module can have the following type: Document header, List header, List position, List footer, List transfer below, List transfer above, List group, Document footer (last page), footers If a document module has submodules, these are taken into account when printing. The system behaves as if the module itself were a document, i.e. all submodules are printed in the same sequence as in the document (see Sequence when printing document modules). This is the description of the functionality of the module "printole" with the name "Printing with OLE (document printing)" regarding Document: A document (pseudo-class CX_DOCUMENT) consists of document modules and has further characteristics such as margin settings, document type, name and document number. Possible document types are: purchasing, Sale, manufacturing, stock, Financial accounting, controlling, Miscellaneous When printing a document, the type of document module determines the order. This is the description of the functionality of the module "printole" with the name "Printing with OLE (document printing)" regarding Sequence when printing document blocks: If the printout fits on one page: Multi-page printout: 1st page 2nd last page Last page. This is the description of the functionality of the module "printole" with the name "Printing with OLE (document printing)" regarding OLE objects in the document module: The OLE objects contain document variables that are replaced on printing with the values of the object to be printed. To do this, the print object must be placed in the PlugSpace (see the statement Define (SetTransactionPlugSpace) in the printole.mod module). By default, the client object and a temporary print object are also placed in the PlugSpace (the client object contains all important information about the client, such as the address; the temporary print object is currently only required for the output of page numbers and subtotals). If the object to be printed is a transaction, all subtransactions are printed as list items of the object. This is the description of the functionality of the module "printole" with the name "Printing with OLE (document printing)" regarding Functions: In ClassiX®, document output is controlled by a document object, which also serves as a buffer between the InstantView® instructions and the print output channel of the respective operating system. The document object holds the information of the entire document and the output is explicitly triggered with PrintDocument. A preview on the screen is also possible. This is the description of the functionality of the module "printole" with the name "Printing with OLE (document printing)" regarding Printing instructions: The system has four classes as follows: CX_PRINTER, CX_PRINTER_PROPERTIES, CX_PAGE_PROPERTIES, CX_PAPER_FORMAT, which can store the settings of the printer and various document types. The objects of these classes can be made persistent. A list of printers installed on the client can be obtained from Printermanager using the function GetInstalledPrinters. To set or display the printer properties the class CX_PRINTER has the function SelectPrinterProperties. This function displays the printer-installed dialog of selected printers, which depends on the printer. Because in this dialog both printer properties (printer name, printer port,) and page properties (paper size, paper orientation,) can be set, the function SelectPrinterProperties puts two objects back on the stack: CX_PRINTER_PROPERTIES and CX_PAGE_PROPERTIES. The margin settings usually cannot be set in the Printer Properties dialog and must be set from within InstantView®, the same applies to custom paper sizes. All paper formats are the objects of the class CX_PAPER_FORMAT. The setting of printer, printer and page properties for a document is done by calling a member function SetPagePropertiesAndPrinter, which saves the settings for a page area. Once the settings have been made, the document can be checked with the method CheckPrintRange to see whether valid settings have been set for all pages. The CXP_PRINT_JOB class represents a print job in the system. In the CXP_PRINT_JOB object, settings such as print area pages from to, number of copies, and sorting when printing multiple copies are set in the CXP_PRINT_JOB object. Therefore, a CXP_PRINT_JOB object must be created before the document preparation using the document method CreatePrinterJob. If the document has several page settings, further print jobs are created automatically: one print job per page setting. If spooling is switched off, the print job is started after the document has been completely prepared using the StartPrinting method or the InstantView® statement PrintDocument. When spooling is turned on, the print job is automatically started when the number of completed pages reaches the number of spool pages. With the PrintToFile function, the document can be archived in this machine. During archiving, one or more files of the type Enhanced- Metafile (*.emf) are generated, which can be viewed with the ClassiX®- Metafileviewer. If the document has several page settings, one Metafile is created per page setting and a vector of created file names (transferred file name + page number from the start area of the page setting) and NULL strings is returned. The NULL strings represent the pages with unchanged settings saved in a metafile. This is the description of the functionality of the module "printole" with the name "Printing with OLE (document printing)" regarding Modules: print.mod, printole.mod, printstd.mod, printpro.mod, paper.mod. This is the description of the functionality of the module "printole" with the name "Printing with OLE (document printing)" regarding Object types used: CX_COM_OBJECT, CX_COMPOUND_TXN, CX_CONTAINER, CX_DOCUMENT, CX_MULTIPLE_COM_OBJECT. This is the description of the functionality of the module "printole" with the name "Printing with OLE (document printing)" regarding Dynamic data fields: none.

This is the description of the module "genproce" with the name "Module Generator for documents without positions": The business object Module Generator creates AppsWarehouse® modules based on templates (*.gen). The following structure is generated.Module generator for documents without itemsThe module generator for documents without items generates four AppsWH modules, a workflow load file, a transaction description load file and extends the EXT and MSG.Instructions for creating a new document without items Generation of the modules/files via the module generator.Extending EditWin by the data fields that are necessary for the description of the document. After this has been done, the SetListBox macro should be adjusted immediately afterwards.Adapting the generated workflow and the generated transaction description to the requirements of the document.If the document should have relevant data fields, which are to be preset by a company role or, for example, a client, the DefaultTransactionWin in the corresponding group must be extended by these data fields. It is important here that the slots used are identical to those in EditWin.A bitmap (with grey and white background) has to be created for the document and in ivFunction.mod the case instruction of the macros G_GetPicture and G_ObjectDescription has to be extended by the new class.In order to use the generated print module it is necessary to create a print document.The ID of this document should be a three-digit letter abbreviation of the class.The document must be assigned to a type or an area (e.g. purchasing, sales, financial accounting, warehouse, etc.).In the INITIALIZE of the print module the variables defaultDocumentID and documentArea should be initialized with the data just defined.The SetWinTitleStart macro must be supplemented by a more appropriate window title. Ex: Create a first draft document: (IN A TEST DATABASE) Inserting the general header and footer into the documentInsert an existing document header into the document, which should be similar in layout to the future document. (Actually, all documents leaving the company should look very similar to each other).This document module must have a new ID and should be given its own name.If the newly created document is now exported and loaded into a new (test) database, the previously used module is not overwritten due to the new ID and the document can now be adapted.The following templates are used ./AppsWH/process.gen - (basic module)./AppsWH/proceedt.gen - (editing module)./AppsWH/procesel.gen - (selection module)./AppsWH/proceprn.gen - (print module)./AppsWH/data/txn-wf/DEFAULT_WORKFLOW.gen - (Workflow)./AppsWH/data/txn-wf/DEFUALT_TRANSACTION_DESCRIPTION.gen - (transaction description)StructureModuleMacrosMessagesWindowBasic module (examp.mod)MacroDescriptionInitCounterThe counter for the class is searched for, if not found one is created.SetListBoxSetFormat instructions for the ListBoxListObjectsFind all objects of the defined classPickObject sentreceivedEDIT_XXXXXXXX_CREATED XXXX_CHANGED XXXX_DELETEDSelectWinOptionsWinEditing module (exampedt.mod)MacroDescriptionSetOptionsUsed to initialise the module with regard to the options and is called up accordingly in the INITIALIZE of the module.CreateSymbolServes to create bitmapsInitBitmapsIn this module, the bitmaps used are created and assigned to variables.

This is the description of the module "cxProductionDataCapture" with the name "Production data acquisition": This module enables different ways of recording production data. The respective detailed description can be found under the description of the different windows (functionality). This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxProductionDataCapture" with the name "Production data acquisition" regarding Input window: This window is used for production data acquisition. You can select a production data acquisition directly by entering the desired number in the field "Number" and confirming it with RETURN or by calling up the corresponding object via the list window (menu item "Search"). Each document bears an identification of its processing method:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxProductionDataCapture" with the name "Production data acquisition" regarding List window: Serves to list the production data acquisition. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxProductionDataCapture" with the name "Production data acquisition" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select a production data acquisition. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxProductionDataCapture" with the name "Production data acquisition" regarding BDE time ticket recording: individual slip: This window is used to enter feedback data from the production plant. Via the menu you can also reach a special window for direct scanning of any barcode printed on the work slip. Attention: External work sequences should be finalised via the procurement process (external work sequence - purchase order - goods receipt - quality assurance). However, it is also possible to finalise these notes directly via the PDC recording, but then no costs of the external production run into the order post-calculation. An incoming invoice cannot be created for the external work sequence either. If the selected work sequence is an external work sequence, the question arises as to whether you really want to report it completed via the normal individual slip. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxProductionDataCapture" with the name "Production data acquisition" regarding BDE time ticket recording: Collected slips: If several entries are selected in the list of worklists, an adapted collective window with a list of all selected entries appears when the menu item "Production data acquisition (SFDC) - Confirmation time" is selected from the context menu. If the selected entries do not have the same resource, it must be selected manually. Via the collective list, it is possible to record several work sequences at once or to report them as finished. In each of the selected work sequences, the total time (over all work sequences), weighted according to the remaining time, is entered as actual time. If the remaining time of the selected work sequences is already zero, the weighting is carried out according to the target time. If even the total target time over all selected work sequences is zero, the reported total time is distributed evenly over the selected work sequences. With this type of recording it is not possible to record (partial) quantities (yield) manually. In case of a finished message the respective quantity of the production order item is automatically transferred (see field description "finished"). Attention: External work sequences should be finalised via the procurement process (external work sequence - order - goods receipt - quality assurance). However, it is also possible to report these notes ready directly via the PDC status change, but then no costs of external production are included in the order post calculation. An incoming invoice cannot be created for the external work sequence either. If one of the selected work sequences is an external work sequence, the question is asked whether one really wants to change these items via this route. If you select "Cancel", the complete process is aborted, i.e. none of the selected work sequences is logged off, as the entered time can then no longer be divided in the correct proportion. You must close the window and open the positions again without the external work sequences. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxProductionDataCapture" with the name "Production data acquisition" regarding BDE time ticket entry: Order item confirmation: This type of feedback is called up from the Production Planning Jobs module. It enables total times for individual order items to be confirmed in total. This is useful, for example, for notifications from final assembly, where you do not want to confirm every single work ticket, but all times in one for one order item at one workstation. In the lower part of the window, the order items for which you want to perform the collective time message are displayed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxProductionDataCapture" with the name "Production data acquisition" regarding BDE status change: This window is used to enter feedback data from the production plant. Via the menu you can also reach a special window for direct scanning of any barcode printed on the work slip. Attention: External work sequences should be reported completed via the procurement process (external work sequence - purchase order - goods receipt - quality assurance). However, it is also possible to report these slips completed directly via the PDC status change, but then no costs of the external production run into the order post-calculation. An incoming invoice can then also not be created for the external work sequence. If one of the selected work sequences is an external work sequence, the question is asked whether you really want to change the status of these items via this route. If "Cancel" is selected, only the "non-external" work sequences are changed, the external ones remain untouched.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions based on the given module description:

1. How do I record production data using the "cxProductionDataCapture" module?
2. Can I select multiple work sequences to record production data simultaneously using the "Collected slips" feature in the "BDE time ticket recording" window?
3. What happens if I select an external work sequence to record production data using the "BDE time ticket recording" window? Will it affect the order post-calculation or create an incoming invoice?
4. Is it possible to record partial quantities (yield) manually using the "BDE time ticket recording" window?
5. How do I confirm total times for individual order items in the "Order item confirmation" window?
6. Can I scan barcodes printed on work slips directly using the "Direct scanning" option in the "List window"?
7. What is the purpose of the "Selection window" in the "cxProductionDataCapture" module?
8. How do I report completed work sequences using the "BDE status change" window?
9. Can I cancel the process of reporting completed work sequences using the "Cancel" button in the "BDE status change" window?
10. Does the "cxProductionDataCapture" module allow me to record production data for external work sequences? If so, how do I do it?

This is the description of the module "opitdbac" with the name "Open items account customers": The documentation compiled here for staff OPs is a specialisation of the general documentation on open items. If there are still open down payment requests for the customer or if down payments have been made by the customer, these documents are displayed in a separate list in the upper part of the screen. From the OR window you can also go directly from the OR window to the customer master data via the corresponding icons or view the journal entry belonging to the OR. You can also print the displayed ORs or transfer them to the reminder window. Afterwards you simply return to the open OR window. This is the description of the functionality of the module "opitdbac" with the name "Open items account customers" regarding List window: This window is used to list and edit the open items and - if available - also the current down payments of a customer. This is the description of the functionality of the module "opitdbac" with the name "Open items account customers" regarding Care Coupling OPs: In this window the coupling of OPs can be edited. The surgery that has triggered an operation is displayed as the primary surgery and is therefore the first and only one displayed in the surgery list.

The documents assigned to a cost object, i.e. the documents posted with a cost object can also contain costs/services. Thus, costs/services can be assigned to a cost object either directly via financial accounting or via special (cost) documents (e.g. time sheets). A company can receive different types of incoming invoices. The majority of incoming invoices are based on a purchase order, through which the invoice is entered in ClassiX. Thus, the invoice can be entered semi-automatically with regard to the data and an automatic invoice verification can be carried out against the order. A second type of incoming invoice are "free invoices", which are usually entered manually in the system without direct trigger/predecessor and therefore always have to be checked manually. By creating purchasing cost units, invoices for a maintenance, leasing or rental contract, for example, can also be entered and checked semi-automatically even though they are not preceded by a purchase order. Especially with monthly maintenance invoices, a manual run means regular, unnecessary additional work. The purchasing cost unit represents the contract concluded between the company and the customer. This is the description of the functionality of the module "costpobj" with the name "Purchasing cost unit" regarding Contract types: Depending on the complexity of the contract, these can be recorded in different ways.

This is the description of the module "testattr" with the name "Testing Attributes": You can test any formulas or conditional tables. Objects of the classes CX_FORMULA and CX_CONDITIONED_BAG can use the function GetInputVarNames() to determine the variables on which their calculated value depends. In case of a formula in the formula (or a condition table: CX_CONDITIONED_BAG) this function calls itself recursively. The module Test formula constructs an input window with this information, with which formulas/condition tables can be tested. The variables are not known a priori - and this also applies to their type, which determines which window object is suitable as input field. InstantView® provides an object Auto, which transforms itself with each FillWindow instruction into a surface object matching the data type. With statement Rename the binding of a window object to the data of a business object can be redefined. The Show and Hide statements ensure that only the used window objects are visible and that widgets that are not required are hidden. Finally, the GetPosition/Move pair moves the result line to the position below the last input field. Here an instance of the class CX_CONTAINER is used as an object for the input data - an object whose only function is to hold dynamic data fields. In a real application the formula gains its meaning in the context of the current processing step. This context is created programmatically by registering all objects containing values for the formula calculation/table evaluation in the PlugSpace (with the statement of the same name). In this simple example only the object CX_CONTAINER is placed in the PlugSpace. This is the description of the functionality of the module "testattr" with the name "Testing Attributes" regarding Functionality: There are two versions of the test window, but they hardly differ:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "testattr" with the name "Testing Attributes" regarding Input window: You must enter the attribute or attributes and then press the Calculate/Test button. If the units are not compatible or there is an error in the formula, an error message will be displayed.

This is the description of the module "Pythia_sanctionsListMonitor" with the name "Sanctions lists Monitor": This app is used to process "hits" once they have been found, i.e. to add the persons/companies/one-time addresses from one's own database or one's own Outlook contacts (not available in the cloud version) to either the whitelist or the blacklist during a comparison with regard to the information in the sanctions lists.If persons/companies/one-time addresses are added to a whitelist or a blacklist, they are automatically matched again after an import/update of the sanctions lists. If the information of the assigned persons/companies in the sanctions lists changes due to the import/update, entries from the whitelist or blacklist are automatically transferred to the checklist to be checked. Entries in the checklist must then be checked again. This is the description of the functionality of the module "Pythia_sanctionsListMonitor" with the name "Sanctions lists Monitor" regarding Sanctions lists monitor: When this app is called up, it automatically checks whether the date of the last match run is earlier than the date of the last update of the sanctions lists. Therefore, if newer sanction lists are available, one is prompted to perform a match run immediately. In the first tab Matches, the processing of the matches of the own business partners takes place. This list should be viewed after each match and - if new matches have been found - these should be moved to either the blacklist or the whitelist. In the blacklist, the business partners are transferred by them as actually sanctioned and thus declared as "blocked" for their business. The Whitelist tab contains the business partners that they have checked and are classified by them as not suspicious. In the Checklist are the business partners whose assigned persons/companies of the Pythia database have been changed during a subsequent re-import of data, necessitating a re-check of the originally blacklisted or whitelisted partners. This is the description of the functionality of the module "Pythia_sanctionsListMonitor" with the name "Sanctions lists Monitor" regarding Hit: This window is divided into two parts: after a comparison, the upper list shows the own business partners (persons or companies) who became conspicuous during a comparison because a certain match with sanctioned persons or companies from the Pythia database became apparent. In addition to the name and address of their business partner, the number of matches with sanctioned persons/organisations/companies in the Pythia database is output. The last column output is the smallest error from these matches, where an error of zero means a "clear match" and an error of one means "no match". (An error of one is not output in the lists). If a row is selected in the upper list, the sanctioned persons and/or companies from the Pythia database that have some match to the matched person/company/one-time address of their own host database or in their Outlook contacts are displayed in the lower list. Lists List Description Matches found on persons/companies/once addresses List of possible matches to the checked persons/companies/once addresses in the host database or Outlook contacts. If an entry is selected in this list, the persons/companies from the Pythia database that may match this partner are displayed in the lower list. Once this list has been logged, its entries can be moved to the blacklist or whitelist using the context menu (right mouse button). Logged (persistent) entries are in the list if, on the one hand, a logging of the result was carried out after a comparison or, on the other hand, if an anti-terror screening log is moved to this list by drag&drop: the hits found for the respective log are then output in this list for further processing. the entry has been added to the whitelist : the entry has been added to the blacklist Sanctioned persons/companies/one-time addresses List of sanctioned persons and companies from the Pythia database that could have a possible connection to the entry selected in the list above. Double-clicking on an entry displays the details of the locked partner stored in the Pythia database. This is the description of the functionality of the module "Pythia_sanctionsListMonitor" with the name "Sanctions lists Monitor" regarding Blacklist: This list shows the partners that they have classified as actually "to be blocked". If subsequent updates of the Pythia database reveal that data has changed for the persons/companies from the Pythia database that are assigned to a blacklisted partner, then this entry is automatically moved from the blacklist to the checklist. This is the description of the functionality of the module "Pythia_sanctionsListMonitor" with the name "Sanctions lists Monitor" regarding Whitelist: This list shows the partners who were conspicuous in a comparison but could be classified as unsuspicious in a check of them. If it turns out during subsequent imports that data on the persons/companies from the Pythia database assigned to a whitelisted partner has changed, then this entry is moved from the whitelist to the checklist. This is the description of the functionality of the module "Pythia_sanctionsListMonitor" with the name "Sanctions lists Monitor" regarding Checklist: This list shows the partners that were originally added to a blacklist or whitelist but whose assigned persons/companies from the Pythia database have been changed during a later import/update of the sanctions lists. These entries must be edited again: Either they can be returned to their original lists (blacklist or whitelist), or they change from blacklist to whitelist (e.g. if the assigned person or company has been removed from the sanctions list) or vice versa. The new status caused by the import/update of the sanctions lists is indicated by a symbol in the checklist: a new person or company has been added to the sanctions lists, which could be additionally assigned to a partner already on the blacklist or whitelist data of such a person or company from the sanctions lists has been changed, which is assigned to a partner on the blacklist or whitelist such a person or company has been removed from the sanctions lists associated with a blacklisted or whitelisted partner context menu.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Offer: New offers can be created directly from the industrial plant or a project. The advantage of this procedure is that relevant data (customer, contact person, ) are directly transferred and the cost unit is correctly linked. It is also possible to simply open, fill and save an empty editing mask. If no project has been assigned to the offer at this point, a new one will be created automatically. The quotation number is consecutive and is assigned automatically when the quotation is created. After the offer data (header data) has been entered completely and the items have been created, the offer must be booked. This is done by switching the traffic light from red to green. Only now the offer is calculated once and can then be printed with the correct prices. In the ' Calculation' tab, the individual items are displayed with their purchase and sales prices (if available). By means of various selection options you can, for example, also provide the offer with a fixed price and/or hide the prices of the individual items for the customer. The customer then only receives the fixed price or the total amount as the offer price. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Offer versioning: If already submitted offers are revised again, a new version of the offer can be created. In this way a history/tracking of the offer versions is possible. The end of the processing chain of the offers is represented by the final status. Either a quotation is lost if there is no order or it is converted into an order. In offer versioning, the counter controls the number of the new offer. There are two possibilities. On the one hand, the counter can be created with the step size 1. This means that the new offer version simply gets a consecutive number. The reference between the quotation versions is then only guaranteed via the document history. Another possibility is to create a counter with a larger step size. The recommended increment is 10 or 100. If this is the case, each new offer receives a number ending in "00". If a new offer version is created, no "new" number is assigned but the number of the last version is increased by one. For example, quotation 04301200 is followed by versions 04301201, 04301202, 04301203. In this example 100 versions of a quotation can be created. If you can manage with less, the increment of the counter can also be set to 10 or 5. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Convert offer to order: To convert a quotation into an order you can convert it with 'Convert quotation into order'. The quotation number now appears as the order number and the previously entered data, such as customer, conditions and items are transferred to the order mask. The transfer of some data, such as the letter, can be controlled via the option window. By entering a confirmation date in the job mask, the status of the job is changed from "not confirmed" to "confirmed". Rules when converting: When converting quotations into orders, hourly records already recorded for service provider groups and their subitems are detached from the service provider group of the quotation and attached to the newly created service provider group of the order. In this way, all hourly records of a service provider group can be found together again. Likewise, all work orders created for the quote service provider group are reassigned. The entire process is now attached to the order. It is also possible to freely combine offers with other orders as successors. This function can be used, for example, if one or more orders have arisen from a general offer. The connection is called up via the menu item "Connect with order successors", whereupon an order can be selected via the selection mask of the orders. After selecting the order, you can see in the document history that the connection has been set. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Mission: The structure and preparation of orders is identical to that of offers. If an order was created from an offer, not only the header data but also the items were transferred. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Components of the offer/order: The structure of an offer is more or less determined by the tabs of the editing mask. Thus, the components of the offer order, each of which represents a separate block in the document, are as follows:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Framework contracts and call orders: Framework contracts are defined by means of a cost revenue and the individual quantities are called up by means of a sales order. See also: Framework contracts and call orders.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Copying of entire offers and orders: Note: Since copying entire quotations or orders also copies all other existing data, such as characteristics, customer etc., errors may occur if existing data is not changed. It is therefore advisable to test the order flow first and to copy only one error-free order further. If you still want to copy a complete quotation or order, click on the first line of the item overview, which also contains the quotation or order number, and drag it into the 'Copy buffer' window. If you then drag this line again into a new quotation or order, the complete quotation or order is taken over. Note: If the quotation or job cannot be expanded in the copy buffer, copying cannot be performed without errors. Please repeat the process. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Release order / order item: Once an order has been created and can be processed by subsequent departments, the order must be released. This release can be done for the complete order, but it is also possible to release only individual items or parts of an item. The release of all order items is done via 'Release' on the Conditions card. If only individual items or individual parts are to be released, each individual item or individual part must be double-clicked and released there via 'Release' for the following departments. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Calculation, pricing: The exact functionality of calculating and pricing is explained in the documentation of the offer and order items. A special feature must be noted here, namely that discounts and packaging surcharges entered in the offer or order header always refer to the discountable or packable sum of the respective offer or order, even if the option "from the value of goods" was set in the corresponding condition!. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Quotation costing: Target1 vs. target2 The target1 represents the order or the offer from a commercial point of view. The offer, on which an order is based, reflects what has been offered and sold to the customer, including pre-calculated costs and prices. However, since the order is also characterised by technical information, it is of course quite possible that the data of the order may change in the course of the technical processing. In this way, the costs in the order (target2) also change. Therefore it is all the more important that the target1 costs are frozen by the offer. (The freezing of the order values is also possible by converting the order into a quotation). (see here). This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Order costing: The calculation of the costs of an order is defined by four variables, the target1 / target2 costs, the planned/actual and the actual costs. Please refer to the definitions to find out what is behind these terms. All three values have a decisive share in the accompanying order calculation. and the success of a project. Thus the target1 / target2 costs serve the planning and preliminary costing of an order in order to achieve the desired margin in the end. The planned/actual value is an important indicator for the achievement of this goal and the actual values can be used to check the achievement of the goal. The plan/actual represents a forecast of the actual costs. For the calculation of the plan-actual, on the one hand the target2-costs are used, which are gradually replaced by the valuation of the successors (Gozinto, order), even before the actual costs have been incurred. Please refer to the following table for the formation of the planned/actual data. By the number of items for which the planned/actual is no longer formed over target2, weighted with their value, a degree of accuracy of the planned/actual in percent can be created. Detailed information regarding the accompanying job costing can be found here in a special topic. The order item category is relevant for creating planned/actual costs on set items. For some categories, the costs of the sub-items are passed on to the higher-level item, for others not. See the order item documentation. A further feature in job costing is the variance analysis, in which the planned/actual costs are compared with the actual costs. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Calculation of marginal costs: The "normal" job costing is based on the target costs (target 1 in the quotation and target 2 in the job). The target costs are calculated including the overhead costs, which can be stored in the production part or globally at the client. With the optional marginal cost calculation, a quotation/order can also be calculated additionally only under consideration of the variable costs. This enables the sales department to determine the absolute lower price limit of an order. In marginal costing, overhead is calculated for each order item and cumulated for the groups and the entire order. The marginal costs of the order are thus calculated from the target costs minus the cumulative overheads. Marginal cost calculation can be activated for individual jobs via the options menu. An automatic presetting of the marginal cost calculation for quotations/orders can be done via the client. The default setting is stored depending on the type of order, as the marginal cost calculation only makes sense for example for new installation orders, but not for spare parts orders.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Recipient/delivery address: The recipient and the delivery address defines where the ordered goods are sent to. Since this does not always have to be the customer of the order, the shipping address (recipient + delivery address) can be structured as follows. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Stopping and cancelling orders / order items: Type of entry: The documents can be cancelled or stopped via the menu items Further processing->Cancelled or Stopped. After selecting the menu item, a date field with the corresponding description appears in which the current date can be entered automatically. This can be changed and deleted manually. If the date is deleted, the cancellation or the stopped status is cancelled again. If one of these interruption types is selected, all sub-items are run through and rebooked. As a result of the posting, all other status monitors such as delivery status, billing status and planning status disappear. These items receive a new confirmation status that is set to the correspondingly selected interruption type. If the order is cancelled, the item is no longer included in the calculation and is no longer taken into account in the overall price calculation of the order. The items can never have a confirmation status and at the same time one of the other statuses (billing, MRP, delivery). If the interruption is deleted, all items regain their original statuses, whereby the confirmation status is not set to active or similar, but deleted. If one of the suspension types is set, no follow-on document can be created for the corresponding items due to the missing statuses that have been replaced by the confirmation status. It is also no longer possible to carry out a sales or technical release. Definition of .Stop: No more new documents can be created, all processes still running continue to run as before. Stopping an order item is used, for example, if technical questions/problems have occurred during scheduling and scheduling is to be interrupted for the time being. .Delivery stop: The delivery stop is used to stop delivery if, for example, a down payment has not been made. .Cancel: Same as Stop, but the prices of cancelled items are no longer included in the total sum of the order, but are treated with the value 0. The cancellation of an order can be reversed by deleting the cancelled date from the corresponding field. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. Can the recipient and delivery addresses be modified after they have been saved?

8. Are there any restrictions on who can cancel or stop an order?
9. Can I reverse a cancellation or stoppage of an order?
10. How does the module handle multiple status monitors, such as delivery status, billing status, and planning status?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Import of order items from AutoCAD: In plant construction, the scope of delivery of an order is often defined in AutoCAD. For this case, ClassiX offers an interface, with which you can automatically transfer the data entered in AutoCAD into the ClassiX order processing. If changes are made to the AutoCAD drawing afterwards, the order data can be synchronised afterwards. Import The import of an AutoCAD drawing is called up via the menu item "Product Configurator - Import - CAD" and begins with the selection of the dwg file. The import now consists of two steps. In step number one, the file is read into ClassiX and the read data is prepared. During the import the user is informed about the status of the process. The import is completed when the read and prepared data are displayed in the import window. The representation of the data corresponds to the structure with which they are transferred to the request in the next step. The "node" is the position of the order below which the positions read in via CAD are created. The default setting is always the position which was selected when the import was called up. In case of doubt this is the order header. If an error occurred during reading, the corresponding items are displayed under the "Error" account. An error occurs if the CAD drawings contain the same position numbers for different article (numbers). Consequently, there must not be the article "Article1" and "Article2" with the same position number "10.1". (Attention: The equality of the attribute values is not controlled). The next step is now the generation of the order items. In this step the items are transferred to the order as they are displayed in the preview. In this step the option "Update prices and costs" can be set. This leads to the fact that after creating the items including the attributes, the prices and costs for each item are determined anew. Synchronisation If changes have been made to the CAD drawing after it has been read in, it is possible to synchronise the order. For this purpose, the same node must be selected when the module is called up and the same drawing must be selected. After step 1, the import of the data, now the positions are displayed with a yellow picture, which could be assigned to an order position. Assignment takes place on the basis of the last import. (If two supposedly identical items were created in AutoCAD and ClassiX, an "equality" is not recognized here). When generating the new items, only those items are created which have not been displayed in yellow. Unreferenced order items are displayed in the group of the same name. These are the items that exist in ClassiX below the node but have no reference to the CAD drawing. It is now necessary to check whether the reason for this is that the items were created manually in the order, or the corresponding AutoCAD block was deleted after import. In the second case the order items are likely to be deleted. The context menu supports you in this case. Notes When transferring the attributes of an order item, only the values of the attributes that were transferred via the sales item are set. If further attributes are used in the CAD drawing, these are ignored without reporting an error. If attributes of a group are taken over during the import, the first attribute with the same data field designation from the master data that does not have a value table is taken over at random. A CAD drawing cannot be imported if there are items with the same ID but which contain different articles. Hints for the creation of the AutoCAD drawing In order for the AutoCAD drawing to be imported into ClassiX, the following attributes should be set in the drawing. (In case other attributes are to be used, customer-specific changes must be made). Trade goods parts The four possibilities of transfer from the trading goods database:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Automatic determination/check of the delivery date: Note: If a provision date is determined via the replenishment lead time, the following formula is used: Provision date = Today + 1 working day + WBZ as working days. If the replenishment time is given in weeks, one week represents 5 working days. 1.1 Evaluation of the proposed delivery date Primarily, the list of order items shows the type of staging and the proposed dates. The latest (most critical) date, which has a decisive influence on the date of order provision, is also displayed separately outside the list.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Variance analysis: <->planned-actual: The variance analysis is used to compare the planned/actual costs with the actual costs. In addition, the causes of cost deviations can be determined. The variance analysis is carried out in two stages. In the first step all order items are examined for a difference between the planned/actual costs and the actual costs. Only those items which show a deviation are displayed. In the second step, the planned/actual and the actual documents can be analysed by selecting an item. As a result, all document chains are displayed in a second list, which explains the variances. By double-clicking on one of these document chains, all related documents can be listed. The grouped document chains are usually displayed via the triggering planned/actual document. This could be a purchase order, for example. In this case the following incoming invoices and incoming credit notes belong to the document chain, which are only displayed after a double click. However, the document chains are only listed if the difference between planned/actual and actual costs of all documents involved is above a certain tolerance limit. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorder" with the name "Offer and order" regarding Variance analysis: target2 costs <->actual costs: All order items are listed if they have a deviation between target2 and actual costs.

This is the description of the module "assetAccountBalanceList" with the name "Investment accounts": The fixed assets summary list enables the valuation of the inventory for a given financial year and the automatic determination and updating of the depreciation possible for tax purposes for each asset (annual financial statement). For each fixed asset in the inventory, the total balance is shown in this evaluation, which is made up of the subtotals of the book values on the 1st day of the financial year to be evaluated, the additions and disposals, transfers, write-ups and write-downs. If no annual financial statement has yet been carried out for an asset, the depreciation possible for tax purposes at the end of a financial year - based on the depreciation rule defined in the asset - is output as the calculated value. Otherwise, the year-end depreciation actually carried out by means of an annual financial statement is output. The totals list corresponds to the fixed asset schedule in the logic of the output of its columns. In addition, the development of the value of the fixed assets since the end of the last financial year can be tracked in the totals list. The following calculation (based on the column values) is possible for this purpose: Book value PY (previous year) plus additions in the current financial year minus "Value on disposal" of a financial year (do not confuse this column with column "Disposal") plus transfers in the current financial year plus write-ups in the current financial year minus depreciation in the current financial year = book value FY (at the end of the financial year)As a cross-check (based on the fixed-asset movement schedule), the following calculation can also be made: AfA-BMGL plus additions in the current business year minus disposals in the current financial year (do not confuse this column with the column "value at disposal") plus transfers in the current financial year plus write-ups in the current financial year minus accum. Depreciation = Book value FY (at the end of the financial year)The asset summary list contains all values and sorting criteria (see last columns asset classes/groups) to be able to evaluate assets. This is the description of the functionality of the module "assetAccountBalanceList" with the name "Investment accounts" regarding List window: The "Options" menu can be used to set different layout options for the listing. This is used for clarity and simplification, e.g. if you only want to see the totals by balance sheet account of the fixed assets or if you want to copy the list without subtotals to the clipboard. Fixed assets can be transferred directly from the list window of fixed assets to the fixed asset summary list using drag & drop. Likewise, lines from the annual account list in the tax depreciation tab of fixed assets can be transferred to the fixed asset summary list.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_capsched" with the name "Capacity planning and scheduling" regarding General capacity planning: Planning the capacity for a resource is always done in 3 steps (please refer to the links to the different sections for more details on each topic): Step 1: Set the available capacity of the resource Step 2: Planning of requirements Step 3: Overview of the planned capacity:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_capsched" with the name "Capacity planning and scheduling" regarding Capacity planning in parts requirements: ClassiX® offers two options for scheduling: Capacity check CTP Usual procedure with desired detailed planning: In brief, the process is as follows: Usual procedure with sufficient rough planning Capacity test CTP Functionality The capacity is defined on the basis of given available hours within a calendar week of a work centre or resource. Each routing item that requires this work center and/or resource adds its expected capacity requirements to the workload of the work center/resource. If the booked requirement plus the requirement to be checked is greater than the planned capacity, there is a bottleneck and the capacity check returns a message about insufficient capacity. Work sequences can extend over several calendar weeks. A work sequence can be spread over several calendar weeks if it has a throughput time of 2 days and starts on a Friday. The total target time is then divided by the number of days and then multiplied by the number of days required in the current calendar week. This results in the proportionally required capacity, in this example the first week has exactly 50% of the target time, the second week also 50%. Via the editing mask of the exploded work plans, the exact booking can be displayed via context menu (Show bookings) - a new window opens with the list of booked resources with proportional capacity in the respective calendar week and a coloured box indicating whether sufficient capacity is available.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "processes_capsched" module based on the provided description:

1. How do I set the available capacity of a resource in step 1 of the capacity planning process?
2. Can I schedule requirements directly from the usual procedure with desired detailed planning option in Capacity Check CTP?
3. What is the basis for defining capacity in ClassiX®? Is it based on available hours within a calendar week?
4. How do I view the planned capacity for a resource in step 3 of the capacity planning process?
5. Can I extend work sequences over multiple calendar weeks, and if so, how does the system handle the capacity planning for such work sequences?
6. How does the system determine the proportionally required capacity for each calendar week in a multi-week work sequence?
7. Can I display the exact bookings for a resource using the editing mask of the exploded work plans, and if so, how do I access this feature?
8. How does the system indicate if there is insufficient capacity for a particular requirement in the capacity check?
9. Are there any predefined rules or constraints that the system takes into account when performing capacity checks, such as prioritization of certain requirements or restrictions on resource availability?
10. Can I customize the color-coding scheme used in the capacity planning overview to better visualize my specific needs?

This is the description of the module "purqitem" with the name "Requirement request item": From the MRP viewpoint, a requirement coverage item represents a planned receipt ("requirements coverage"). If requirements are ordered, the requirement request item is replaced by another MRP receipt document: Order item (e.g. in the Approved Requirement Request module). Attention- Transfer of attributes from order item: If a requirement request for an order part with in-house supplies is created either directly from an order or as level 0 in the part request, all order item attributes are transferred to the requirement request. Usually only those attributes are taken over which are available in the attribute bar of the variant part. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purqitem" with the name "Requirement request item" regarding Position types: see order position.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "purqitem" with the name "Requirement request item" regarding Cancellation: A requisition item can be cancelled (for example, if the item has already been ordered but the order was subsequently cancelled). A cancelled requirement request item is not considered in most modules: it is not posted to the MRP account, the parts to be ordered are considered as not yet requested, etc. In info modules, however, such items are displayed (e.g. document history). This is the description of the functionality of the module "purqitem" with the name "Requirement request item" regarding Transfer of data from the requirement request into a purchase order: The prices of the requisition item are not copied into the purchase orders, except that no price could be redetermined, controlled by characteristics from the order/item and the selection of the supplier, or the price is 0. For more detailed pricing in orders see here. The note for the recipient is also included in the order. The note, however, is not. The note for the recipient appears in the field of the same name in the delivery schedule. In the list of delivery schedule lines on the order item, this text is displayed under the heading Remarks. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purqitem" with the name "Requirement request item" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain requirement request items. Via the item 'Edit - Item type' you can select how the price of the item should be calculated. With the point 'Edit -Type' you can decide afterwards which type the position should be displayed. Via the item 'Edit - Select part' you can call up the different search masks via the points specified there. Via 'Purchasing part', for example, the search mask for order items opens, from which you can now select the relevant item by double-clicking. The 'Requirement request item' window adapts to any selection. If you have decided on one of the possibilities, e.g. for a sales order, you can take over items from an order directly via 'Insert'. The 'Order item' window then opens, in which you call up the corresponding order, select the item to be ordered and confirm with 'OK'. The order quantity must be specified in the 'Part' section. Clicking on 'Part' opens the search mask for the parts master, from which you can now select the relevant part by double-clicking. If a provision is necessary for the requirement request, a note is displayed next to the order type: ATTENTION: PROVISION. Next to this hint a button "Beistellungen" appears, which opens the attached provisions. In the field 'Supplier' you can select a supplier from the supplier master. You can then enter the price, the supplier's order number, any discount to be granted, the desired delivery date and any comments on the order under 'Note'. Press 'OK' to save your position and the machine will automatically assign a position number.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_variant01" with the name "Variant parts" regarding Variant parts: In ClassiX® a variant part is a description for an actually occurring part, a pattern for a distinct part. This description includes - as for any other part - an identifying number, a description, various details, such as logistic and dispositive identification, etc. However, a variant part is also described by means of a list of characteristics. This list of characteristics defines the characteristics or quantities whose different values or characteristics can be used for an actual part. {img type="fileId" fileId="320" thumb="box" width="100%"} If you give a value for the length and a value for the width of our sheet metal with the number 4711, then such a part is described completely exactly. Although only one (variant) part is specified ("sheet 4711"), by additionally specifying the values of the characteristics, it is possible to describe different characteristics of one and the same variant part and thus define different, exactly described parts. A variant part can thus be used like any other part in the system, with the difference that all values for characteristics in the characteristics list must always be specified. The advantage now is that a variant part only has to be defined once in the system, only once as master information in the part master. Nevertheless, a large number of different versions of this variant part are available for further processing in the DP system. If you need sheet metal 4711 in length=100mm and width=50mm, but at another time you need the same sheet metal in length=30mm and width=12mm, you have to enter values for length and width, but you always use the other information of the variant part already stored in the system. In principle, the characteristics of a variant part - as in our example of the sheet metal - can take any value, but valid value ranges can be assigned to the characteristics or attributes. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_variant01" with the name "Variant parts" regarding Lower and individual parts: As we have seen, variant parts make particular sense when you are dealing with "equal" parts of the most varied characteristics/dimensions/performance. However, if some characteristics (keyword "standard sizes") of a variant part are used very often, it makes sense to store them as independent parts in the part master. A subpart must hold all attributes of the characteristics bar. Assuming that the two sheets of type 4711 with the dimensions 100/50 and 50/40 are frequently required, they are created in the parts master and assigned to the variant part as so-called lower parts. These subparts can also have the same part number as the variant part, but they must each have different values for the attributes length and width. As a rule of thumb, a variant part should always be created as a subpart in the system if it is kept in the warehouse. In ClassiX®, parts in the part master, which are neither variants nor subparts, are called individual parts. Individual parts can also be specified more precisely via their attributes, but these attributes are only for information purposes. {img type="fileId" fileId="322" thumb="box" width="100%"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_variant01" with the name "Variant parts" regarding Specifications: Specifications are automatically generated by the system if variant parts for which there is no distinct lower part are to be booked into the warehouse as surplus or remaining quantity. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_variant01" with the name "Variant parts" regarding Part Rolls: Like all other parts in ClassiX®, variant parts can also have different rolls. Specifications as purchase part are described and stored in the purchase role, prices for sale in the sales role, etc. Subparts always also use the role information of the variant part assigned to them, unless they themselves have such a role object. In our example the part 4711/length=50mm and width=40mm has its own purchase role, but uses the sales role of the assigned variant part. {img type="fileId" fileId="324" thumb="box" width="100%"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_variant01" with the name "Variant parts" regarding Examples: In these examples typical schemes for the use of variant parts are shown. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_variant01" with the name "Variant parts" regarding Definition of semi-finished products I (cut-to-size parts): {img type="fileId" fileId="326" thumb="box" width="100%"}.

This is the description of the module "saleset" with the name "Sales set": A sales set is a sales item that consists of a bundle of other sales items. In its simplest form, it is just a designation for a combination of other articles. Although a sales set is a part roll, it is the only part roll that does not need to be related to a part. For example, if the combination of the sales articles - the sales set itself - is stocked, it must be assigned to a part (consisting of the combined parts). For example, a spare parts set would be a sales set consisting of different spare parts. If the spare part sets are pre-packed and stored in the warehouse, then the spare part set has its own part number. The possible packaging (bag, sack, carton) of a sales set can be assigned to the part of the sales set as a parts list, accordingly the compilation of a set can be assigned to the part of the sales set as a routing. A special form of the sales set is the assembly set, whose individual parts are directly processed as a parts list.Conditional individual parts in sets Conditional individual parts can be included in sets. Characteristics can be assigned to these conditional individual parts, which later appear in the offer or order items. If no characteristics were entered for these conditional individual parts, the quotation or order item automatically takes the characteristics of the selected individual part from the parts master.Characteristics of the lower partsWhen sub-parts are added to sets, all characteristics of the selected part are copied from the part master into the characteristics of the new sub-position of the set. These can now be set as desired and are then valid for all quotation/order items created from this set, if the characteristics have not been explicitly defined and thus overwritten.Calculation and quantity calculation for main and sub-items Five types (types) are distinguished as to how sub-items are assembled with the main item (see the field "Type", which is displayed on the first tab "Quotation/Order item" if a main item has been loaded); besides the definition of pricing rules and quantity calculation, the control of the business processes disposition, delivery and invoicing are determined according to the type.Description: (see order item).

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_kanban" with the name "English:Kanban" regarding Description: A Kanban part is a part for which there is a storage place that is replenished by the employees themselves. The system works like in pharmacies by means of a card (Kanban is Japanese and means "card"), which is located at the bottom of a storage box. If an employee takes the last item from this box, he or she must take the card and pass it on to the purchasing department. There are then so many of these boxes in the Kanban warehouse that the minimum stock level (e.g. a full additional box) is never fallen below). If necessary, production then simply takes these goods without having to create a withdrawal document. To replenish the boxes, orders or stock orders are created and booked as normal, but in the end no goods are put into storage; the stock level always remains at that of the last inventory. The provision of production order items or spare parts orders is carried out via the usual staging lists, but no goods storage or goods withdrawals are created from here. When creating the goods withdrawal documents from the staging lists (staging status and picking list), no document is created, but the item is technically staged (written off from the system as a requirement that is no longer open) and a kanban withdrawal slip is printed immediately. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_kanban" with the name "English:Kanban" regarding Safety stock: The safety stock level (SiBe) is determined and entered manually for Kanban parts. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_kanban" with the name "English:Kanban" regarding Replacement time: The replenishment lead time for Kanban parts is determined via the preliminary parts costing. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_kanban" with the name "English:Kanban" regarding Consumption: The funding will be made available as follows. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_kanban" with the name "English:Kanban" regarding stock management+stock replenishment: For kanban parts, a main inventory is taken annually, which determines the displayed stock level of a part for the entire year. This really means that there are no posted stock movements over the year. If a card is now handed over to the dispatcher by a production worker, which means that goods must be newly procured for the part indicated on the card, the following scheme applies: The kanban part is defined by a logistics indicator.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "printProblems" with the name "Printing troubleshooting" regarding Blocks are not displayed contiguously: One of the possibilities for an incorrect display of document blocks is a "hard line break" in a dynamic data field. These can be found quickly in the Word Editor in the formatting view (¶). The line break should either be removed completely or replaced by a soft line break ( Shift + Return ). This is the description of the functionality of the module "printProblems" with the name "Printing troubleshooting" regarding Formatting of the DocVariable is not reproduced correctly.: Microsoft Word sometimes plays mean tricks on users and developers. During the development phase of ClassiX® the phenomenon occurred that a DocVariable in an OLE module is assigned a certain format (e.g. Arial, bold, italics) and then later on is not displayed correctly when printed. In this case it helps unfortunately only the whole block (or table column) in which the variable is to be reformatted. The best way is to mark the block and set it to normal format ( Shift + Ctrl + N ). Afterwards the formatting can be set again. This is the description of the functionality of the module "printProblems" with the name "Printing troubleshooting" regarding Document variable is not recognized.: Word reports that the document variable is not available when editing the OLE module: In the simplest case, this could be due to a typing error in the document variable. To check the spelling of the variable, switch to the field function mode (Alt + F9). If the variable is written correctly, it could still be an update problem. Exit the Word Editor and call it up again. This is the description of the functionality of the module "printProblems" with the name "Printing troubleshooting" regarding Finding required DocVariables: The required DocVariables can be identified via the monitor window. To do this, move the mouse pointer over the element to be included (e.g. the customer's address in the offer mask) and press the right mouse button. The monitor window opens and the title bar already contains the name of the desired object (in this case: "address"). With the InstantView® command " GetObject "you get the desired object on the stack and with the call: " SendMsg(INSPECT_OBJECT) "the object can be viewed in the object inspector. In the object inspector you can now view the attributes of the selected object. For example, if we want to insert the customer's company headquarters as DocVariable in a document module, we note this in the DocVariable as follows: (cf. insertion of "dynamic data fields"). This is the description of the functionality of the module "printProblems" with the name "Printing troubleshooting" regarding Standard DocVariables: In order to make processing in document creation a little easier, some of the most important DocVariables for document creation are listed here. "var ": The InstantView® variables can be accessed via the function:"var()". (Example var(cyberEnterprise).uniqueID="000" determines the current client) See also:"Access expression ("var") In order to locate the InstantView® variables in the monitor window, the object "cyberEnterprise" can be placed on the stack. From here the variables can be accessed with the function"Get()" or"Copy()". Or via: " SendMsg(INSPECT_OBJECT) "the object can be viewed in the object inspector. Similarly, you can also call up the monitor window from the print dialogue and select printObject place the entire document on the stack. This can now again be checked with the object inspector ( SendMsg(INSPECT_OBJECT) ) and search for variable names. "call ": With the help of the special function call(macro name ) InstantView® macros, which provide a return value, can also be accessed to use them as DocVariable. If the macro returns an object as return value, the access expressions can also be used in the conventional way. For example call(Makroname).y List of frequently used InstantView® variables. This is the description of the functionality of the module "printProblems" with the name "Printing troubleshooting" regarding IF condition is not interpreted correctly: In almost all conditions it is checked whether a value is present or not. The condition then looks like the following: { IF { DOCVARIABLE uniqueID } <> " " "Instruction for true" "Instruction for false" } This example checks whether the data field uniqueID unequal (<>) is empty. Please note that empty in Word is represented by two double inverted commas with a space between them. ( " " not "" ) If the condition is still not recognised, the document variable against which the comparison is to be made must also be placed in double inverted commas. Result: { IF "{ DOCVARIABLE uniqueID }" <> " " "Instruction for true" "Instruction for false" }. This is the description of the functionality of the module "printProblems" with the name "Printing troubleshooting" regarding A document module is not printed: A document module (e.g. the header) was not printed.

This is the description of the module "onewaypa" with the name "one-time partner": One-time addresses are used in ClassiX® in order not to inflate the master data if an address is used once and has no informative value for the company afterwards. For example, an order can be delivered to a ship that is temporarily in a port. The address of the port has no value for the company after delivery, so it is not worthwhile to create it as a company. One-time addresses can be created as one-time persons or one-time companies. This module is used to search and list the one-time partners. This is the description of the functionality of the module "onewaypa" with the name "one-time partner" regarding List window: This window is used to list one-time partners.

I hope these questions cover all aspects of the module description and provide useful information for an unfamiliar user looking to learn more about the "onewaypa" module with the name "one-time partner".

This is the description of the module "odocu" with the name "Customer documentation": The "Customer Documentation" module is used to compile all user manuals and documents of an order which have to be provided to the customer. This document is therefore always the successor of an order. The processing of this type of table of contents is carried out parallel to the delivery notes, because the documents are usually not an order item or refer directly to such items, if the parts to be documented only appear in the parts list, for example. This is the description of the functionality of the module "odocu" with the name "Customer documentation" regarding Creating and editing a customer documentation directory: Creating a customer documentation starts with the selection of the order for which the documents are to be made available to the customer. If one skips this step and continues directly with the creation of the items, the order is automatically assigned by selecting the items. The position of the customer documentation is usually generated automatically. The entire order or a selected order group or item is searched for documents. In addition to the order items, the production parts lists are also searched. An item is created for each item to be documented. If an article is found several times in different order items or bills of material, these are all assigned to one item as predecessors. Several documents can also be assigned to the item. In the "Execution" group, a workstation can be assigned to the directory, which is responsible for compiling the documents. When the document is posted, this task is posted to its worklist. By setting the "completed" indicator, the status is advanced and the task is booked out of the worklist again. The directory can be printed from the customer documentation. There are usually two types of documents available for this purpose. On the one hand, this is the customer documentation directory for the customer, which clarifies the assignment of the documents to the order items/articles and on the other hand, this is a picking list for order picking, i.e. the compilation of the documents. This is the description of the functionality of the module "odocu" with the name "Customer documentation" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain customer documentation.

This is done via this window. Optionally, an alternative can be specified. This value is used if the variant document reference does not have a sub-document reference in the first value. In this way, English could be selected as an alternative if there is no document for the first language. The attributes that are necessary for the specification of the variant documents are listed in the window. The values are proposed based on the attributes from the customer documentation and the predecessor of the order. This is the description of the functionality of the module "odocu" with the name "Customer documentation" regarding List window: This window is used for listing .

Sure! I am ready to assist you. Kindly provide me with the description of the module you want me to create questions for.

This is the description of the module "cxStructure" with the name "Keywords": The central element in the structuring or classification of master data are classification terms, which can also be called structures. With this app, you can visually structure (order) any business objects such as parts (into parts classes), articles (into statistics groups), customers (into sales areas) or financial accounting accounts (into balance sheet and P&L frames). All business objects can be assigned to any classification terms as often as desired. As an example a simple classification for parts according to part classes is shown here: {img type="fileId" fileId="450" thumb="box" width="100%"}Once such a structure tree has been defined, any business objects can be assigned to a "branch" or "structure node" by "drag & drop". Business objects can also be assigned several times to different "branches/nodes" of the same tree.Order terms can and should also be used for temporary actions: e.g. the compilation of different customers into mailing campaigns. Objects namely, which are ordered in a branch/node, can conversely now be inserted as a complete group into other applications by "drag&drop". For example, individual customer groups can be assigned to a transaction document with a specific cover letter in one and processed as a form letter. The structuring is done by assigning the master data to individual nodes in the structure tree, so in the example individual customer types are assigned to the customers. The classification terms can now in turn be assigned properties, so a customer group can be assigned to each customer type. (In the example of the customer group, conditions (discounts, surcharges, warranties, ) can be assigned to a group of customers.). This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxStructure" with the name "Keywords" regarding Structuring and categorisation of data: {img type="fileId" fileId="452" thumb="box" width="100%"} Further examples: - Article groups -> Sales statistics groups: Definition of cost type and article group discounts - Vendor type -> vendor group: definition of vendor conditions. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxStructure" with the name "Keywords" regarding Automatic structuring of data: The typical structuring of data is done via the classification terms and their structure accounts. The assignment of the - usually - master data is done manually via the respective editing mask of the master data or by assignment via drag&drop via the tree display of the classification term. Structure status accounts can also be used for automatic structuring. In this case, the structure status nodes of the evaluation group are provided with a transition condition as they are also used in the business processes. Through this, the structure node is determined automatically if the structured master data objects change. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxStructure" with the name "Keywords" regarding Input window Order key: This window is used to maintain keywords. You can select an evaluation group by double-clicking on the desired evaluation group in the list window or by pressing the "Edit" button. From the input window, the list window can be opened with the menu item "Search". In order to insert business objects into the structure of a created classification key, they are simply dragged from another window, e.g. "Cost types" or "Articles", to the desired position in the structure using drag&drop. To insert a sub-folder or to edit it and the underlying structure, select the corresponding sub-folder and choose the item "Sub-folder" from the "Edit" menu (you can also get this functionality by right-clicking on a sub-folder): you can choose between inserting a new sub-folder below the selected item or deleting the selected sub-folder or removing one in the business object from a sub-folder. With very large structure trees it is often very tedious to move subfolders within the tree. Therefore, by selecting "Move subfolders" in a new window you can directly select the position to which the selected subfolder should be moved. With "Expand subfolders" a subfolder is also deleted from the structure tree, but the contents of this subfolder (together with any other subfolders) are moved to the next higher node. Remark: The menu for editing "subfolders" can also be obtained by right-clicking on the node to be edited. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxStructure" with the name "Keywords" regarding Subfolder (default) input window: This window is used to maintain the subfolders (branches/nodes) of a classification term. Certain order terms (e.g. "CONTINOUS_STOCKTAKING" for dividing storage bins for permanent inventory) can have their own window definitions (see here). This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxStructure" with the name "Keywords" regarding Subfolder input window (perpetual inventory): This window is used to maintain the subfolders (branches/nodes) of the special order term ("CONTINOUS_STOCKTAKING") for dividing storage bins for perpetual inventory. The difference to a standard sub folder is that no characteristics can be maintained and that a list of the inventories that have been carried out for this storage bin node is listed.

This is the description of the module "loggirit" with the name "Deployment (deployment status)": In order to be able to deliver products to customers or to be able to produce in a manufacturing plant at all, it must be guaranteed that the parts required for this are available at the right place at the desired time: This is called provision. This module is used for the display/further processing of parts to be provided or already provided within the logistics supply chain in a company. On the one hand, it is possible to differentiate between external demand triggers (sales order items) or internal demand triggers (storage and production orders). (For further selection options according to storage bins or only open documents, see below) A provision must therefore be made not only for the dispatch of goods, but also within the company within the framework of production. To be provided: Depending on the logistical identification (purchased or manufactured part) and the type of provision (non-stock-keeping or stock-keeping with corresponding special forms such as JIT, etc.) of a part, parts are supplied to the logistical business process from Order requirements (for purchased parts not kept in stock) construction contracts (for production parts not kept in stock) or Storage reservations The programmatic execution of the provision from purchase requisitions - carried out by employees of the incoming goods department - and the provision from production orders - possibly carried out by employees of a final inspection - are not absolutely necessary, but they facilitate the control over the whereabouts of parts. The provision from stock reservations - carried out by employees of the warehouse - leads in the standard system to the creation of stock withdrawal documents (stock removal documents). In the case of KANBAN parts or special material withdrawals, staging is carried out in the same way as for warehouse reservations, but no goods withdrawal documents are created for these staging types. Instead, when the menu item "Create goods withdrawal from selected items" is selected, the selected items are immediately technically staged and a withdrawal slip is printed out. If the corresponding programme steps for provision have been carried out, the part requests are automatically transferred to the next state (status): Provided: Analogous to the states of the parts to be provided, the following states result here Provided: Goods receipt Provided: Manufacturing Provided: Warehouse Provided: Shipping The state "dispatch" stands for those parts which are sent directly from the warehouse to dispatch for customer orders. (The part is kept in stock and the requirement trigger is a customer order). This is the description of the functionality of the module "loggirit" with the name "Deployment (deployment status)" regarding Functionality: Depending on the selection of the staging status (see above under description) and the other selection options, the pegged requirements of parts are displayed. The button"Order" can be switched to"Stock order" or"Finished order" by pressing the right mouse button. In the field to the right of the button you can then enter the corresponding number of the order to get all pegged requirements for this selected order in the list. If the search is initiated without entering a number, all pegged requirements for the selected status are displayed. (The search is also triggered by pressing the OK button) The parts required for a selected job are always displayed. Therefore you should not be misled by the fact that e.g. when selecting for a production order and selecting states of production (Make available from production order or Make available from production) only production orders are displayed which are sub orders of the selected production order (and not the selected production order itself). The"Only open quantities" box is enabled by default to display only the open requirements. The box"Order items" selects (customer) order items as pegged requirements. The box"Production documents" selects exploded parts list items (from sales and stock orders) as pegged requirements. In the"Cost Center" field, you can select the cost center that causes the demand. If no selection is made, all cost centres are displayed. The"Stock" User Box is displayed only when it is a staging condition of stocked parts. If "all warehouses" is specified, there is no selection by warehouse, if "only selected warehouses" there is a selection by the warehouses specified to the right of it (in the standard system all warehouses are preselected), if "no selected warehouses" is specified, exactly the selected warehouses are omitted. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. Can we filter the displayed provisions depending on their origin (e.g., external demand triggers vs. internal demand triggers)?
2. How do we distinguish between non-stock-keeping and stock-keeping provisions? What are the different special forms available for each type of provision?
3. Can we stage parts from storage reservations or purchasing requisitions directly to the shipping status without creating a goods withdrawal document?
4. How do we create stock withdrawal documents for staged parts? Is there a direct link between staging and generating withdrawal slips?
5. Can we customize the cost center field to reflect our organization's specific cost structure?
6. What happens if we select "All warehouses" in the Stock user box? Do we still need to specify selected warehouses if we want to stage parts from specific locations?
7. Can we switch the order button to "Stock order" or "Finished order" using the right mouse button? How does this affect the displayed provisions?
8. Why might only open requirements be displayed by default? Are there scenarios where closed requirements might also be relevant for provisioning purposes?
9. Can we select order items or production documents as pegged requirements? How do these selections impact the displayed provisions?
10. What happens if we select a production order that has suborders? Will the displayed provisions only include the parent production order or also its suborders?

Technical description of the provision of an order item from the staging list: If an order item is selected and made available for provision via the menu Edit->Selected documents->Print, the following logic is executed: Special features of the provision list In the list, a red dot appears in the storage bin column if the storage bin is invalid. This is the description of the functionality of the module "loggirit" with the name "Deployment (deployment status)" regarding Progress indicator in business process ORDER_ITEM_DISPOSITION: The progress indicators consist of a three-digit number, of which the individual digits have the following meaning: First digit (progress of work): 0 = only created 1 = prepared for disposition 2 = Disposition is initiated 3 = Position has been provided 4 = position was stopped 5 = position was cancelled Second digit (state in progress): The individual work progresses can be numbered by a sequence. The second digit has no fixed meaning, it only serves to represent the sequence in which the individual sub-steps of a work progress are processed Third digit (disposition type): 0 = General 1 = bearing parts (parts with bearing guide) 2 = Order parts 3 = production parts Example: Progress indicator 203 means that a production part has already been transferred to a production order but has not yet been staged.

This is the description of the module "invoimaint" with the name "Recurring outgoing invoice": This app is primarily intended for the creation of recurring outgoing invoices. In the second place, it is also possible to create evaluations of already created recurring A/R invoices or an overview of all recurring A/R invoices. A recurring A/R invoice to be issued can be defined via an order in two ways. Firstly, a sales order can be of the type "maintenance contract" and a payment condition of the type "recurring payment" and the settlement type "lump sum payment". This type of recurring A/R invoice is useful if, for example, the invoice is for flat-rate maintenance. A second way of defining a recurring A/R invoice is to enter an order item with a payment term of the "recurring payment" type. This option can also be used, for example, to bill for maintenance if the maintenance does not have to be paid as a lump sum (fixed price), but rather depending on a quantity (price per unit or per licence). In this case, the order item defines in more detail the amount of maintenance (e.g.: 15 licences * 100€/licence = 1,500€) and the payment conditions of the type "recurring payment" define the billing period (e.g. monthly, yearly, etc.). The rent for software, for example, can also be invoiced in this way. The preparation of such recurring outgoing invoices is based on the following rules: An A/R invoice is always issued on the first day of the period entered on the recurring payment term. The period ("Check by date") is used to check whether a recurring outgoing invoice should be issued by this date. Based on the interval defined in the condition, the system automatically checks how often and when the recurring outgoing invoice is to be created. Already settled, recurring outgoing invoices can be listed as an option. After listing the recurring outgoing invoices to be issued, the outgoing invoices can be generated for the selected entries by clicking on the invoice button in the toolbar. Items are combined to one A/R invoice if the order and the due date are identical. In this way, orders with different recurring payment items (e.g. 30 licenses as monthly rent + 1 monthly maintenance flat rate) can be settled via one invoice.

This is the description of the module "oitmsupp" with the name "English:supply chain management": This module is mainly used to determine the delivery or provision status of one or more order items. Once an order item has been delivered, it is displayed as completed. If it has not been delivered, all parts of the supply chain necessary for complete delivery are displayed with their respective status. The status of possible follow-on documents (requirement request, purchase order, goods receipt, quality assurance, return document) is evaluated for MRP order parts (merchandise), for MRP production parts the status of the follow-on documents is determined and displayed for all parts of the bill of material (exploded bill of material item, parts request, production order, purchase order documents, etc.). If an order part has been produced, then the system will also flexibly search for follow-up documents from production and vice versa. ClassiX® supports flexible disposition, i.e. purchased parts can be manufactured or production parts can be ordered (also partially). This flexible disposition is also recognised and correctly evaluated by the SCM. Exceeded deadlines are additionally marked. For stocked parts the availability is determined at the warehouse. In the missing parts list with the option "Only insufficient parts" only those parts in stock are displayed which are available in insufficient quantity on the requirement date. A number of options (see below) serve to quickly gain an overview of the delivery capacity and its bottlenecks. By being able to navigate to the subsequent documents or to higher-level items, you can quickly obtain all the information necessary to intervene to ensure punctual delivery. This is the description of the functionality of the module "oitmsupp" with the name "English:supply chain management" regarding List window: In addition to this global menu there is a context sensitive menu (right mouse button) related to a single list entry. This is the description of the functionality of the module "oitmsupp" with the name "English:supply chain management" regarding Option window: All settings can be made here. The window can only be closed with the "OK" button. Requirements are never displayed twice, i.e. if an order item to be produced exists as an open requirement. for which there is already an exploded BOM item, the BOM item is displayed as to be produced instead of the order item. The same applies to requirement requests: if a merchandise order item is still open, only its follow-on document is displayed, not the order item itself. No settings in the options are necessary for this.

This is the description of the module "generalLedgerBalancesStructureList" with the name "Account evaluation": If balance sheet and/or P&L accounts (G/L accounts) and/or person accounts (customers, suppliers, employees, commission recipients) are structured by means of classification terms of the type "balance sheet framework", account (balance) evaluations can be created by means of this module. Analogous to this module, there is a cost type evaluation for cost accounts (cost type and cost centres) within the framework of business accounting.For each structure main node and sub-nodes, the current debit/credit values with balance of the selected posting period (period costs), the opening balance and the cumulated debit/credit values from the beginning of the fiscal year belonging to the posting period up to the specified accrual period - or optionally up to the end of the corresponding fiscal year - are displayed with the closing balance.If the selected structure contains nodes with the structure ID "ASSET" (to identify the active side) and "LIABILITY" (to identify the passive side) and if G/L accounts are inserted in it that have the identification balance exchange, the accounts are either suppressed or output according to their active or passive balance. Optionally, the accounts organised in a structure node - with their corresponding period, opening and closing values - can also be output. It is also possible to specify whether or not the person accounts assigned to the totalisation accounts should also be output. For personal accounts, the - freely definable - balance due can also be output. If several domains are assigned to a client, the account evaluation can be called up for individual domains or cumulatively for several domains at the same time.

This is the description of the module "cxWorkFlowRoute" with the name "Process routes": Business processes describe the flow of a single document by means of status (monitors). However, since the status of a document can be dependent on the status of another document, it must be possible to link several business processes of different documents with each other in order to map the complete process chain. This run through different business processes is called a process route.A simple example of this is the process route of a production part to be manufactured for an order:Before production, the order item runs from status "created" to status "bill of material released". If a production order - as a new document of another business process - with the status "created" is now created from this status, the order item itself is switched to the next status "production order" (PRODUCTION_ORDER). The order item remains in this status until the production order has reached the status "provided". Only then does the status of the order item change to "ready": Production" (PRODUCTION_PROVISION).Such concatenations are possible within the transition descriptions in the individual status monitors, in the following figure using the example of the transition from the initial state "Production order" (PRODUCTION_ORDER) to the subsequent state "Ready: Production" (PRODUCTION_PROVISION): The process route to which this transition belongs is selected via the "Process routes" button. Then, by double-clicking on the newly assigned process route, the detailed processing of this assignment can be carried out. In this detail editing, a description can now be entered, e.g. which follow-on documents are necessary or similar. The possible start statuses of the follow-on documents can now be inserted into the list "Follow-on monitors" by clicking the "Insert" button. It is also possible to drag and drop the successor status directly into the list.Some data that the system cannot automatically find out must then be added: On the one hand, the class of the follow-on document must be specified (in this example CX_PRODUCTION_ORDER for a production order), and on the other hand, the process name must be entered. The process name is the name with which a document is linked to a business process and which is then specified for switching (triggering) a status monitor (e.g. here: productionOrderItem Get(TriggeredStateMonitor("PRODUCTION")).The fields in the "Origin" group are empty when first opened and later only serve for navigation: in which transition is this dependency and to which process route is it assigned there.Once all these dependencies have been maintained, a view of the business processes through which the process route passes can be created afterwards. To the right is an example of the extent to which a document (order item) has already run through this process route. With the help of this graphic, it is now possible to see which steps still have to be carried out before the order item can be set to the status "Ready: Production" status. In this example, the production order has only just been created (status is framed in red), it still has to be started, completed and made available. This graphic can be called up from the document history by right-clicking the status and selecting "Show process history".

This is the description of the module "ctacbals" with the name "Cost elements totals list": With this module the costs accrued on cost elements can be listed. On the one hand, the costs are displayed for the selected posting period (the so-called period costs), on the other hand they are cumulated from the beginning of the fiscal year belonging to the posting period up to the specified accrual period or optionally up to the end of the corresponding fiscal year. Costs can be posted to cost elements via financial accounting, via cost/service postings and via goods storage or removal. When goods are placed into or removed from storage or retrieved from a cost centre, they are only posted to the allocation cost element for storage stored in the client. A further option enables the additional output of the cost centres booked per cost type. A difference line is output if the total of these cost element/cost centre postings does not match the total costs posted to the cost element. In the special output form in the style of a company accounting sheet (BAB), the costs of the individual cost elements are also output per line, but the costs related to each cost element and cost centre are shown as columns of the individual line. A double click on a list entry navigates - if period values exist - directly to a list of postings, otherwise to an overview of the period balances of the selected fiscal year. By using the right mouse button you always reach the overview of the period balances of the selected account in the selected fiscal year.

This is the description of the module "processes_advancedemand" with the name "Preliminary requirements - description": Advance requirements are used to cover real requirements that are generated at a later date. This is useful for parts with long replenishment lead times (planned delivery time or in-house production time). For this reason, preliminary requirements make no sense for e.g. level 0 parts within a sales order. You can create the corresponding order item directly and do not have to take the diversion via advance requirements. Therefore, preliminary requirements should only be created for MRP sub-items of a production BOM that has not yet been exploded and technically released as a whole, if the time between technical release and the required procurement date is shorter than the expected delivery time. However, the same can also apply to sub-items kept in stock, which have a very low minimum stock level, show high consumption and also have a relatively long delivery time. There you can use the advance requirements to reserve a certain number of parts in the warehouse before the actual disposition of the finally exploded parts list. The system only makes sense if the planned part is actually scheduled at a later point in time, i.e. can be offset. It therefore makes no sense to create an advance requirement for part X, whereby this part always occurs as a component of the higher-level and stock-keeping part Z, and this part Z is also ultimately planned. It makes just as little sense to create an advance requirement for a part that only appears in parts lists as a constructive (fictitious) item and is ultimately never manufactured and is therefore not planned. Advance requirements documents can be created in the course of planning. When creating a preliminary requirement, it is specified for which order and on which date how much goods are expected to be needed. A preliminary requirements document can contain several items. Only one - not completed, openly running - preliminary requirement can be triggered per order for each part. A scheduled advance requirement item (with a staging date) is posted in the MRP account as a requirement trigger ("future issue") and therefore leads to an increase in requirements for the corresponding part. The "aim" of the document is to reserve or procure the preplanned quantity in advance. Later, the respective advance requirement item is replaced by a "real" requirement trigger in the MRP account; this can be an order item or a part requirement item. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_advancedemand" with the name "Preliminary requirements - description" regarding Registration in the dispo account: Advance requirements always post two quantities in the MRP account: 1. sales order quantity (quantity of the advance requirement item not yet staged) 2. reserved quantity (quantity of the advance requirement item not yet allocated to an order item) More about the bookings here. The advance requirement remains in the MRP account until it has neither an open, unallocated quantity nor an open, uncommitted quantity left. For example, an advance requirement may appear in the MRP account with open quantity 0. This then only counts up the reserved quantity. How the demand is met depends on whether the part is a purchased part or a production part. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_advancedemand" with the name "Preliminary requirements - description" regarding Purchase part:: When saving a scheduled (i.e. a provision date has been entered) advance requirement item with an MRP purchased part, a requirement request is automatically generated which then participates in a normal procurement cycle(approval, order, etc.). The requirement generated by the advance requirement is thus immediately covered again by a requirement request or purchase order in the MRP account. When the goods receipt arrives, it can be immediately prepared for this order. Even if the advance requirement has not yet been assigned to an order item. The demand for stocked purchased parts is normally reported via the demand and stock list, which can also be used to start the supply chain. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_advancedemand" with the name "Preliminary requirements - description" regarding Production part:: As soon as scheduling is complete (i.e. a provision date has been entered), the production cycle can be started for the advance requirement item with a production part: by pressing the button "Explode parts lists" (in the toolbar on the advance requirement item screen) the explosion of the parts list defined for the part is started. The requirement is covered by the corresponding production order item. The quantity reserved by an advance requirement item can be used up in two cases: 1. a part is pre-planned for an order -> in the order an order item with the same part is created => the order item is automatically linked to the advance requirement item (document history ) and the quantity is transferred If the full reserved quantity has been consumed (order item quantity greater than or equal to the quantity reserved via advance requirements), the advance requirement is thus automatically completed; otherwise, only the order item quantity is rebooked. 2. a part is preplanned for an order -> for an order item in the order a part request for production is created (e.g. a gozintograph), in which the preplanned part is needed => the corresponding part request item is automatically linked to the advance requirement item (document history), disposition type is set to "advance" type and the quantity is transferred. If the full reserved quantity has been consumed (part requirement item quantity greater than or equal to the quantity reserved via advance requirements), the advance requirement is thus automatically completed; otherwise, only the part requirement item quantity is transferred.

This is the description of the module "statturn" with the name "Parts consumption": This app is used to display parts consumption. It shows which quantities of one or more parts have been consumed in an adjustable period of time. This app is intended as an aid for logistics. Related to this are the apps Parts Usage (intended for use by technology) and Parts Usage (intended for use by service/sales). If you generally want to evaluate the use or non-use of a part in a certain period, you can do this by means of an inspection run.In addition to the output of the list with the parts with consumption in the selected period, the complementary list with the parts without consumption in this period is always output in parallel. The following movements are referred to as part consumption:Goods receipts that have not been put away (MRP goods receipt)Production order items that have not been put away (dispositive production). Outsourcing The parts are selected by means of the part selection window, which opens after pressing the toolbar button or the "Select parts" button or simply dragged and dropped into the list. With drag&drop, parts rolls are also accepted.By selecting/restricting the staging types of the parts (MRP parts, stock parts, etc.), you can control which parts consumption (goods receipts, MRP production, stock removals) is taken into account in the evaluation. If, for example, only stock parts are selected (staging types: warehouse management, manual stock, remaining quantity, Kanban, own provision of stock), then the planned parts consumption is not included in the evaluation. As a side effect, the list of "parts without consumption" also provides a so-called list of slow-moving items. The total consumption of a part results from the sum of the above movements. The evaluation of the total consumption is done according to the following logic: If an incoming invoice has been issued for these goods in the selected period, the price is taken from this invoice and multiplied by the total sales quantity. If no incoming invoice has been created, the system searches for other documents and uses their price for the calculation. When posting the above-mentioned documents, they are entered in the parts transaction file in relation to goods receipt or production - each subdivided into year and month. The corresponding quantities are registered here. Thus, when creating the parts consumption, only the parts operation files of the individual document types have to be fetched and the quantities compiled from them. An exception to this is the removal from storage. Here the quantities are not collected in the parts procedure folder, but in the warehouse statistics. This can be accessed via the warehouse account of the part. A record is created in the list for each part and for each period with consumption, unless the part does not have an operation folder. (For more on this, see the options window)Parts without consumption are listed in the tab "Parts without consumption". A double click opens the stock movement window for the clicked period. Attention! Validity is not taken into account in part consumption, i.e. consumption across exchange objects is not displayed! Attention (only companies with separate client turnover)! If the option "Split variant parts" is set via the options window, the split display is incorrectly displayed for clients whose material logistics are not separated according to domains/company codes. The total sum of all variant part characteristics is displayed behind each characteristic of a variant part. This is also not possible to separate subsequently, as the conditions for this are defined solely in the transaction descriptions. (What is consumption of one company, what is consumption of the other?) Attention! If a part is marked as "constructive assembly", it is not displayed as "consumption"! From the dispo account , the parts consumption statistics can be accessed via the "Parts consumption" group. If this way is chosen, the consumption of the last 12 months is displayed in the list, whereby the displayed filter remains on the currently valid period. So if you simply use the "Create statistics" icon, only the current month will be displayed. The variant filter possibly transferred via the dispo account must also be taken into account: If the statistics from the MRP account were called up after double-clicking on the MRP list with split variants, the statistics will only display the turnovers of the transferred characteristic. To delete the filter, click on the toolbar button "Reset list and delete variant filter ". This is the description of the functionality of the module "statturn" with the name "Parts consumption" regarding Option window: The following display settings can be specified in the options window:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "statturn" with the name "Parts consumption" regarding Technical documentation: A global macro with a period and a part is called, which creates a container per period.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocextjobsched" with the name "Extended workbench" regarding Description: Many manufacturing processes require work to complete a part or an assembly that your own company cannot provide (e.g. special surface finishing such as galvanising). For this purpose, ClassiX® offers the possibility to integrate external work sequences into work plans. It is also possible that the work is to be carried out completely by an external company. The external manufacturer needs all the material of the production stage, whether pre-assembled or not, to carry out the work. For all these cases the external work sequences are suitable. If only a part of the parts list is to be sent to the external manufacturer because he procures or owns the rest of the required parts himself, it is more advisable to declare the part not as a production part with external work sequence, but as a purchased part with self-supply. Description of provided parts. Each workstation can contain resources in the form of machines, work groups or suppliers. These resources assigned to the work centre in this way can be used freely on the routing as soon as the work centre has been selected on the routing item. Since routings themselves are only assigned to the part to be produced (the part to be finished, e.g. water pump), but the purchase order for the external work must be created via another part or unit of activity (e.g. unit of activity galvanising), the order article via which the external work is ordered can also be specified on the work sequence. The external work sequence therefore contains the following data, which makes it the external work sequence:.

Sure! I am ready to assist you. Kindly provide me with the description of the module you want me to create questions for.

This is the description of the module "loadeddlls" with the name "Loaded DLLs": ClassiX® consists, technically speaking, of a number of executable files and libraries (.dll files, in the following referred to as DLLs). There are ClassiX® own DLLs, foreign libraries, ObjectStore DLLs and system DLLs. All DLLs are loaded into the address space of the process. This module provides an overview of these DLLs and shows where the DLLs were loaded. {img type="fileId" fileId="406" thumb="box" width="100%"} For each DLL loaded by the ClassiX® process, this information is output: DLL: Name of the DLL Sequence: DLLs are loaded into the memory one after the other. This number indicates when the DLL was loaded. Base address: Each DLL has stored where in the address space it should best be loaded. But if this memory area is occupied, Windows loads the DLL into another, free address space (O6MOP1.dll in the picture, this DLL collides with another ObjectStore DLL) Windows moves the DLL tacitly; nevertheless this process is not without consequences, because on the one hand the movement takes some time, on the other hand a moved DLL can only be swapped out via the swap file (otherwise Windows throws the DLL out of the RAM and reloads it later from the .dll file). Size: Number of bytes the DLL occupies in memory. Address area: A summary from the previous two columns for the sake of clarity. Original address space: If a DLL has been moved in memory, this shows where the DLL would have been loaded to if there had been enough space in that location Address space. Path: File name with full path. The list is only a snapshot, because during operation ClassiX® can load further DLLs, in which e.g. rarely used functions are stored. These functions can in turn reload further DLLs themselves. The sequence shows which DLLs were loaded first and which last. How you can see why the address space for ObjectStore cannot exceed a certain limit is explained in the section Address Space.

This is the description of the module "queryatt" with the name "Enquiry about characteristics": You can search objects by their attributes (e.g. all parts that are black). This is the description of the functionality of the module "queryatt" with the name "Enquiry about characteristics" regarding Functionality: Almost all data in the ClassiX® system can receive additional information via so-called attributes. For example, an attribute could be assigned to each company, indicating how many employees this company employs. Another one, how many screen workstations there are. This module is now available, for example, to search for all companies with more than 40 workstations. It allows a combination of an unlimited number of attributes, which searches for suitable objects in the list from which this search was opened. All attributes to be searched for can be inserted into the list with the "Insert" button. After the insertion the comparison operators (e.g. =, >, present, not present) and the possibly required comparison values can be set here. They are linked with"AND". So if two attributes are inserted in this list, both attributes (as set) must be present on the object in order to obtain a hit in the search. Example: Search via the list of companies: Attribute "NUMBER_OF_EMPLOYEES", comparison operator ">=" comparison value "40". All companies that have the attribute NUMBER_COMPLETEES with a value greater than or equal to 40 are found.

This is the description of the module "processes_qm_bat" with the name "Suppressed errors": Batch run refers to database operations in which data is automatically processed in the background or as a night run without the user being able to interactively influence it. Therefore, no information messages, queries or error messages appear. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_qm_bat" with the name "Suppressed errors" regarding Functionality: Since individual data may have been entered incorrectly or incompletely (e.g. missing costs for a part) and the operation should not be disrupted as a result (i.e. it must be possible to remove this part from storage even if the costs have not been entered), the user must be able to check after these runs which data were not successfully processed. In ClassiX®, these error and warning messages are collected in monitors provided for this purpose and can be clearly accessed and managed/corrected by the user. These monitors are divided into the respective database operations: All documents that are not processed correctly are assigned to these monitors with an error message. If, for example, the costs for the order part or production part cannot be completely determined during a stock removal, the item is not posted in the final costing but an entry with the error description is created in the error monitor "stock removal". The errors can be retrieved and corrected in the "Suppressed errors" module. For the order cost evaluation and the warehouse statistics it is important that these errors are corrected before the statistics are compiled.

This is the description of the module "purchaseProposalsList" with the name "Order proposal Kanban semi-finished product": Parts that are marked as Kanban semi-finished products can help to replenish the warehouse manually. All current requirements of a Kanban semi-finished product are listed in the order proposal list after further processing (stock parts) of the part request.Kanban semi-finished parts are parts that are made from larger raw material. For example, a holder plate that is stamped from a large raw material sheet.This sheet metal plate is not stocked because the remaining surface dimensions in the warehouse cannot be accurately calculated by punching out certain shapes. The remaining quantity of sheet metal plates is estimated for each requirement and either reordered via the order proposal list or simply rejected. All parts requisition items run in Kanban semi-finished products end up in an order proposal list with the status "order proposal" until either an independent warehouse order is triggered directly from it, or the items are rejected via a button.The order proposal list shows all requirements of the semi-finished product across all orders. Only from the overall context across all orders is it reliably possible to make an estimate as to whether a raw material is better ordered or still sufficiently available. Therefore, the list is created without restrictive search fields. It must always be kept clean.Regardless of whether rejected or ordered, the parts request item is then posted to the status "Provisioned: Stock" is posted. By means of a date (decline.date = rejected or approved.date = used as template for warehouse order), statistics can subsequently be built up for evaluation purposes.The goods, if they are ordered from the list and provided via a goods receipt, are put away like a Kanban part, namely without a putaway document. With the provision of the goods receipt, the goods receipt is put away.The warehouse stock is only determined once a year by an inventory and remains unchanged throughout the year.The Kanban semi-finished parts do not appear in the Kanban list of production, their replenishment time is determined as for JIT parts and scheduled in the Gozinto.The decision whether a raw material is ordered in the order proposal list or not does not change the lead time of the Kanban semi-finished product.From here they can either be rejected or an independent order can be created for them to replenish their stock.Then the part request items are set to the status "Ready: Stock" and no longer appear in the order proposal list. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchaseProposalsList" with the name "Order proposal Kanban semi-finished product" regarding List window: The list contains all parts requisition items via Kanban semi-finished parts that have not yet been further processed via this list. A double click on the list opens an extra window in which all attributes of the marked position are listed with their calculated values.

This is the description of the module "cxContact" with the name "Contact person": Contact persons are the employees of other companies. (The employees of your own company (the clients defined in the system) are maintained separately in the employee module ). When trying to create a contact person for a branch of the own company, this person is automatically created as an employee and not as a contact person, because a branch of the own company cannot have contact persons. Business-relevant data, such as a person 's function, department, business e-mail and telephone extensions, are maintained with this module. For the purpose of a successful CRM, it is also necessary to classify contact persons according to their importance or other criteria (e.g. "gets Christmas card"). This can be done by means of general classification terms or user-specific favourites (see additional data). Persons can be employees of different companies at the same time; employee information is role objects for persons. As a rule, the person object is automatically created when a new employee is created; if the person already exists, the employee information must be created by inserting a role. The listing or maintenance of employees can be done from the company master screen or one of its roles using the button This distinction becomes particularly important when a transaction document is called up from the contact person: Accordingly, the activity folder of his company or company role is inserted in addition to the activity folder of the contact person. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxContact" with the name "Contact person" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain contact persons. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxContact" with the name "Contact person" regarding List window: This window serves to list the contact persons. You have the choice between 2 different types of search.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxContact" with the name "Contact person" regarding Contact person (Extended list window: In this list window you can search for contact persons across all companies. It is necessary to enter at least one search criterion. In the fields of the group contact persons you search directly for surname, first name, department or functions. You do not need to know the company of the desired contact person. However, if you search for companies, all contact persons of the companies found will be displayed in the list. A combined search is always carried out across all search fields. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxContact" with the name "Contact person" regarding Electronic business card (vCard): In this window, contact persons can either be read in using their electronic business card (vCard) or their electronic business card (vCard) can be created for contact persons and their own employees.

This is the description of the module "dataConnectorImport" with the name "Data Connectors Import": This window is used to compare and import data connectors. Basically a data connector can be loaded from a file and compared with a data connector from the database. All differences are displayed and it can be selected which data should be taken over during import. The comparison and import of a data connector takes place in the following steps: Load data connector from file Compare data connector and select data for import Import data connector In principle, several data connectors can be loaded and compared in parallel. You can always switch between the simultaneously loaded data connectors via the combo box File. However, not too many data connectors should be compared at once, because with each comparison many transient objects must be created and kept in memory during the comparison. This slows down the system in case of very many simultaneous comparisons. If all data connectors are to be taken over at once and without any changes, it is recommended to use the menu item Automatic Import, which processes all files in a way that saves memory. In the following, the individual steps of a comparison and import are described. This is the description of the functionality of the module "dataConnectorImport" with the name "Data Connectors Import" regarding Load data connector from file: If you click on the button with the three dots to the right of the Combox File, a dialogue opens to select the file with the data connector. Several files can be selected at the same time. As soon as a file is selected, it is loaded and compared directly with the corresponding data connector in the database. The data connector is searched for using the identifier. The two data connectors are specified as source (file) and destination (database) below the file. This is the description of the functionality of the module "dataConnectorImport" with the name "Data Connectors Import" regarding Compare data connector and select data for import: Once the file has been loaded and the data connector from the file is compared with the one from the database, the result of the comparison is displayed in the Changes group. In the list on the left side all objects and their connections are displayed, on the right side all data fields of the object selected in the left list are displayed. The symbol in each case indicates which action is performed when the data connector is accepted. A blue tick means that nothing is changed, a green tick indicates that the value in the database is overwritten, a green plus indicates that an object is added and a red cross indicates that an object is deleted. While the action in the list on the right hand side only applies to exactly this data field, in the list on the left hand side it means that a corresponding action applies to any data field below this object. Using the context menu on one of the two lists, you can select on the left for an entire branch or on the right for a single data field whether or not the changes are to be transferred to the database. The symbols in the lists are updated immediately. This is the description of the functionality of the module "dataConnectorImport" with the name "Data Connectors Import" regarding Import data connector: Once all the changes to be made in the database have been selected, these changes can be saved in the database by clicking the Apply button.

Sure! I am ready to assist you. Kindly provide me with the description of the module you want me to create questions for.

This is the description of the module "billing" with the name "Invoice or credit note": This module is used to maintain invoices and credit notes. An invoice is a receipt (document) by which a natural or legal person asks the recipient of a delivery or service to pay the agreed price within a certain time. A credit note is used for settlement in the same way as an invoice for a delivery or service. The credit note is issued by the recipient of the goods or services and not by the supplier. Instructions for printing invoices and credit notes can be found here. This is the description of the functionality of the module "billing" with the name "Invoice or credit note" regarding Structure of the invoice/credit note: When creating an item-related invoice, the order structure is basically taken over and retained, but shifted down one level, e.g: A credit note can be created from invoice items (item-related) or for an order header (flat rate). When creating an item-related credit note, the invoice structure is basically taken over and retained, e.g: When creating a flat-rate invoice or credit note, a single subgroup is created representing the order header, e.g:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "billing" with the name "Invoice or credit note" regarding VAT invoice: As a rule, an invoice is taxed at a single rate. This VAT is determined by the customer or the business transaction and is indicated in the invoice header. In this case, it is easy to calculate the amount of tax as it is calculated on the full net value of the invoice. For account assignment, this means that the entire tax value is posted to the VAT account of the tax key specified in the invoice header. However, this "ideal" calculation is not always applicable. For example, several rates may be applied to the same invoice where an invoice covers both "normal" and reduced-price goods. In this case, part of the goods are taxed at 19% and another part at 7%. In this so-called additional tax calculation, each item can be assigned its own tax rate. This means the following for the entry of the invoice. In the invoice header, the tax rate should be specified which is to be applied to the invoice by default. (for domestic customers this would be 19% VAT). No tax then needs to be specified on the normally taxable items, as the following rule applies. If an item does not have a tax key, the tax defined in the next higher item with a tax applies. Consequently, only the reduced items must be assigned the different tax. If these items are all combined in one group, the tax can also be defined once in the group, as the rule mentioned above is applied again. The consequences of the additional tax calculation are obvious. During account assignment, not only one tax account is addressed, but the number of accounts is equal to the number of tax keys used. In addition, the gross amount results from the addition of the gross amounts of the items and not from the calculation: total net value times tax key of the header. If the invoice has a fixed sum, the resulting tax difference to the real position values is divided proportionally according to the tax values of the positions. This means that an item with a tax of 0% can never have a tax value. The indication of the tax can already be made in the order. When creating the invoice, the tax is then transferred to the corresponding items and groups. This is the description of the functionality of the module "billing" with the name "Invoice or credit note" regarding Further processing of invoices/credit notes: As soon as an invoice/credit note is registered, most input fields are blocked. So booking can mean "block the stand that was sent to the customer", if the invoicing looks like this: Create invoice / credit note à print à register. Only when an invoice/credit note is registered, the preceding documents are adjusted accordingly, e.g. business process statuses are forwarded (examples: item-related invoice registered à corresponding delivery note and order items forwarded to "invoiced"; item-related credit note registered à corresponding invoice forwarded to "credited", etc.). This is the description of the functionality of the module "billing" with the name "Invoice or credit note" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain invoices or credit memos. You can select an invoice or credit memo by entering the required number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to open the list window, you can select the menu item "Search".

This is the description of the module "billcond" with the name "Conditional parts list item": A conditional BOM item of a bill of material contains a conditional list of individual BOM items, the so-called variants. This provides a tool for defining different parts in a BOM item, e.g. due to different characteristics of the part to be produced. Different quantity specifications can also be stored in an individual bill of material item as a table. In the course of a bill of material explosion, the item whose condition is fulfilled first is inserted into the production bill of material. Attention: See also special features of conditional tables. This is the description of the functionality of the module "billcond" with the name "Conditional parts list item" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain conditional BOM items.

This is the description of the module "olapRepresentativeList" with the name "Commission recipient UK article Statistics": With this module a commission taker (representative)/sales item or sales item/commission taker(representative) statistics can be created for specific periods of time. The basis of these statistics are 2-dimensional OLAP data cubes (see also monitors) between representatives and sales item objects. Depending on the selection of the - primary - dimension (i.e. the point of entry) into the statistics, the second remaining dimension is the so-called secondary dimension. If you choose"representatives" as the primary dimension, the "sales items" are the secondary sub-dimension and vice versa.Depending on the selection of the primary dimension (commission recipient (representative) or sales item), the total values of the statistics can vary. This is because sales can be made with "representatives" even without sales articles (e.g. when using text articles or fixed values in orders or outgoing credit notes). A statistic according to "commission recipients" can therefore be larger in total than the "same" statistic according to "sales articles".The data is updated each time an invoice or credit note is saved. Whether the values are shown in the totals of the statistics depends on the status of the respective documents. Below is a list of the statuses that are included in the statistics totals for the various documents (the documents themselves are nevertheless always kept in the corresponding data cubes, only the values are not always added up):Invoices/credit notesAll registered invoices/credit notes are included in the statistics (registered credit notes are only considered if they are issued for a customer. Credit memos for commission recipients are therefore excluded, for example)All statistic values are held in local currency only. This is the description of the functionality of the module "olapRepresentativeList" with the name "Commission recipient UK article Statistics" regarding List window: After selecting the criteria, this window displays the commission recipient/item of sale statistics.

10. Are there any limitations or restrictions on creating statistics with the "olapRepresentativeList" module?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_projectlifecycle" with the name "Project life cycle" regarding General: Both projects and orders have a self-contained life cycle. Thus the life cycle of a project comprises the time period from the creation of the project to the last possible point in time at which project activities can still run. Usually this is the end of the warranty. Orders end with the acceptance, i.e. the declaration of the client that a delivered product or service fulfils the contractual agreements. At this point the order is delivered and invoiced. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_projectlifecycle" with the name "Project life cycle" regarding Life cycle orders: The life cycle of an order is determined by its business processes, consisting of the invoicing (INVOICING), delivery (DELIVERY) and confirmation (CONFIRMATION) processes. Of these three processes, the confirmation process is the one that determines the end of an order by the status "fulfilled". The fulfilment of an order depends on the type of contract. A distinction is made here between the purchase contract and the contract for work. If an order is deemed to have been fulfilled, it can no longer be extended/modified. Costs and revenues can therefore only be incurred for the already existing scope of delivery and services. For example, an incoming invoice from the forwarding agent may arrive after the order has already been declared as completed internally. Credit notes, as an example of successors with revenue effect, can also be issued after the order has been completed. The order confirmation process is as follows: This functionality is linked to the message "CHANGE_WARRANTY_OF_COST_OBJECTIVE". Users who are allowed to send this message enjoy special rights and may, for example, define an order as a contract for work and determine the warranty period. If you are authorised to do so, the order mask of the fulfilled orders is not blocked either, as they firstly represent a kind of superuser of the orders and secondly could be tricksters anyway. Users for whom the message is blocked are subject to the full restrictions.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "processes_projectlifecycle" module, based on the provided description:

1. What is the purpose of the "Project life cycle" module?

6. Can you explain how costs and revenues are handled for an order once it has been declared as complete?
7. What is the significance of the message "CHANGE_WARRANTY_OF_COST_OBJECTIVE" in relation to the life cycle of an order?
8. As a user, what rights do I have when it comes to sending the "CHANGE_WARRANTY_OF_COST_OBJECTIVE" message?
9. Are there any restrictions on modifying or extending an order after it has been confirmed?
10. How does the life cycle of an order impact the ability to modify or extend the order?

This is the description of the module "receitem" with the name "Goods receipt item": Items of the goods receipt slips. This is the description of the functionality of the module "receitem" with the name "Goods receipt item" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain individual goods receipt items. The goods receipt should be compared with the orders as soon as possible. You can select orders by clicking on the button 'Order' and drag & drop the delivered order items into the window (mark the line and hold down the left mouse button), or assign any part from the parts master via the menu item 'Edit - Select part'. If you have selected several order items, a separate goods receipt item is automatically created for each order item. Note: If no selection entry is made in the list Order item (all), all order items are read into the list. Depending on the specification, this means that all order items that have existed since the system was started are loaded into the list. This process takes a lot of time and should therefore be avoided. Goods receipts that cannot be immediately assigned to an order item should be given a corresponding comment in the Description field. (The field "Part" is hidden for such items.) Another employee can then more easily make this assignment later. These goods receipts can be found with the function "Unclear goods receipt" in the stock menu. Apart from "Unclear goods receipts", goods receipt items always refer to a delivery schedule line item. Thus information such as the part is only displayed and cannot be changed. Please note that the quantities ordered for own consumption - i.e. for a specific cost centre - are not shown on the warehouse account in the total "In Goods Receipt" or "In QA", as this ordered quantity is not intended for general "dispositive" consumption, but only for the specified cost centre! Labels can be printed for goods receipt items via the goods receipt header document. See the description of label printing. This is the description of the functionality of the module "receitem" with the name "Goods receipt item" regarding List window: Used to list the goods receipt items.

This is the description of the module "cxConditionedBag" with the name "Conditions table": Standard window for editing conditional tables. A conditional table is a list of entries in which - depending on mutually exclusive rules or conditions - only one entry can or is valid at a time. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxConditionedBag" with the name "Conditions table" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain conditional tables. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxConditionedBag" with the name "Conditions table" regarding Column editing window: This window can be used to define attribute columns. For example, in a conditional table (price table, etc.) the attributes can be defined, which are used to build the condition. In the order processing, this module can be used to define the attributes that are to be listed individually for each item in the item list in order to be able to sort using them, for example.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "cxConditionedBag" module with the name "Conditions table":

1. What is the purpose of the "Conditions table" module in cxConditionedBag?

This is the description of the module "salesOrderEngineering" with the name "Release order item technically": With this module, sales order items are technically processed and released. A technical processing depends on the logistic identification of the part on the order item: If it is a production part, the order-specific production parts list can/should be generated for this part, if it is an order part, the requirement request can/should be made.A text article on an order item is first treated logistically like an order part for technical release, a requirement request can (not necessarily!) be made. It should be noted that text articles do not have a unique identification or a separate MRP account, so it is not possible to check whether the text article has already been passed on to the purchasing department as a requirement request. It is therefore recommended to always check the document history of text articles carefully: a corresponding warning will be issued. This is the description of the functionality of the module "salesOrderEngineering" with the name "Release order item technically" regarding Functionality: Via the menu item 'Activities - Technology - Release order item' you reach the window 'Release order item'. When you select an order, all parts that have been set to the status 'Design check' appear. By double-clicking you reach the window 'Release order item'. Here you can process the individual part, for example, by inserting a revised bill of material or by choosing Edit order item' to switch directly to the order and edit the item there. In the field 'Characteristics' you can also insert or delete items from the characteristics list. You can also enter notes in the lower part of the window. Save your entries with OK. With 'Release' you can complete the position. The status of the item is now set to 'Create bill of material' and released for the next departments. If the button "Release" is pressed, the standard disposition is initiated. This means that either the item goes to the status warehouse reservation, a requirement request is created or a production bill of materials is exploded. The technical release then takes place automatically. In the case of the auxiliary disposition menu items, the system first creates the subsequent document without the item already being technically released. This is also useful if you first explode the bill of material, then go to work scheduling for checking, and only release the item after the check. This is the description of the functionality of the module "salesOrderEngineering" with the name "Release order item technically" regarding Overhangs: If there is a stock on hand for a disposable part of the order item, a partial stock reservation is created via a stock reserve document if the option "Consume surplus quantities automatically" is set. If the complete order quantity is available, the complete order quantity is also reserved by the warehouse. In case of partial quantities, the reserved quantity is reduced by the following document (part request or requirement request). This is the description of the functionality of the module "salesOrderEngineering" with the name "Release order item technically" regarding Available production parts with minimum stock: These parts are always given the status 'stock reservation' when they are released for sale. If stock is available, a stock return document is automatically created during the technical release. If there is no stock and you want to produce these parts for this order, you must explode the production BOM (menu: "Edit->Production BOM->Explode"). Then the status of the order item changes to "BOM created". This is the description of the functionality of the module "salesOrderEngineering" with the name "Release order item technically" regarding Disposition: It is also possible to order a partial quantity for production parts from the technical release or to take it out of stock. For this purpose the menu is used, in which all possible entries are activated, if there is the possibility to use them here. There is one exception: If a stock-keeping part or an order part is in the order item, a partial quantity cannot yet be produced. The possibility of the partial disposition "production order" exists at the moment only for production parts that are available for disposition. If the quantity of a posted partial MRP document is changed after a part request has been created, the quantity of the part request and the production order items are also changed. The production orders receive an identifier that they must be reprinted and appear again in the worklist. This is the description of the functionality of the module "salesOrderEngineering" with the name "Release order item technically" regarding Effects of technical release: In addition to the follow-on documents that are created during the technical release, the new status itself has the following effects. For example, only technically released items can be delivered. Otherwise, the creation of the delivery note would be cancelled. On the other hand, the part that is hidden behind the sales item is frozen. Thus, all changes in the order item that would influence the part (attribute changes, for example) are prohibited. This is the description of the functionality of the module "salesOrderEngineering" with the name "Release order item technically" regarding List window: This window is used to list order items for which the technical release has not yet been performed. The technical release can also be reset in this window and the exploded bill of material can also be deleted. 
Sure! Based on the provided module description, here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "salesOrderEngineering" module with the name "Release order item technically":

1. How do I create a new release order item in the "salesOrderEngineering" module?
2. Can I modify the bill of materials for a release order item in the "salesOrderEngineering" module?
3. What happens if I release an order item with insufficient stock in the "salesOrderEngineering" module?
4. How do I explore the production BOM for a release order item in the "salesOrderEngineering" module?
5. Can I partially dispose of a release order item in the "salesOrderEngineering" module?
6. How do I reset the technical release of an order item in the "salesOrderEngineering" module?
7. Can I delete an exploded bill of materials for a release order item in the "salesOrderEngineering" module?
8. How do I check the document history of a text article in the "salesOrderEngineering" module?
9. What is the difference between a stock-keeping part and an order part in the "salesOrderEngineering" module?
10. How do I create a requirement request for a release order item in the "salesOrderEngineering" module?

These questions cover various aspects of the module's functionality, such as creating and modifying release order items, managing inventory, exploding bills of materials, and checking document histories. They also touch on important considerations like partial dispositions and the distinction between stock-keeping parts and order parts.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "salesOrderEngineering" with the name "Release order item technically" regarding Input window: In this window the further processing of the order item can be controlled. The disposition can be started automatically according to the standard by simply releasing the position via the release button. However, if the order item is to be scheduled differently than it is normally scheduled, the menu can be used to decide which scheduling path this order item should take. So if the part on the order item is normally withdrawn from the warehouse, the item is posted to the status warehouse reservation when it is simply released. However, if the goods are to be produced directly for this order item due to a lack of stock, the production parts list can be created via the menu and the item can then be released. It then ends up in the production process and appears in the next parts planning as an order part to be manufactured in production. Furthermore, a special bill of material, production comments and characteristics can be created and defined in this window, which control the further course of the production process (e.g. length specifications, material specifications, etc) If the production parts list is to be deleted again due to inadvertently incorrectly set characteristics, this can also be done via the menu. Furthermore, it should be noted that for companies that automatically trigger the complete further processing (production order and all necessary dispositions) with the technical release of order items to be produced, it is possible to delete all automatically created subsequent documents when deleting the parts list. If several order items have been combined in a parts scheduling system, the release and parts list for all combined order items is carried out after a user query.

This is the description of the module "kpiAuditor" with the name "KPI Auditors": KPI auditors are observers of transaction documents for the definition and determination of business key figures = Key Performance Indicators (KPI). KPI auditors can be used to collect key figures for supplier evaluation, machine utilisation or the quality of a cost centre, for example. The KPI auditors determine the key performance indicators by name and also the set of rules according to which they are determined. The KPI auditors are integrated either via the business processes (workflows) of transactions, whereby the key figures themselves are processed via transaction descriptions, or by direct assignment to business objects. The KPI Monitor App is responsible for the actual display and evaluation of the KPIs defined by means of this app. This is the description of the functionality of the module "kpiAuditor" with the name "KPI Auditors" regarding Evaluation types: There are three types of indicators: Evaluated key figures (ratings), auxiliary key figures, counters and values. Key figures of the type counters and values can be derived directly from a document and are summed up in the key figure monitors for the suppliers, years and months. These can either be evaluated directly in the statistics or serve as auxiliary key figures for the evaluated key figures. Examples counters: number of invoices, number of orders, etc. Examples of values: total value of goods, total discounts taken, etc. Auxiliary key figures are not key figures per se, but serve as intermediate variables only for a clearer calculation of the key figures. They are therefore created as attributes of the type "for internal purposes only" and are thus hidden in the lists for compiling the statistics, among other things. Valuatedkey figures (evaluations) are not determined directly via the document and written to the monitors, but they result at the time of the evaluation. The sum of the evaluated key figures is the best way to compare different business objects (customers, suppliers, etc.). The determination of the evaluated key figures can itself be differentiated into three types: In the monitor list, the total evaluation can be determined according to the three calculation types mentioned, but the individual key figures are only displayed in two calculation types. On the one hand, this is the type "Normal average" and on the other hand the type "Cumulated average". If the type "Moving Average" is selected, the individual key figures are displayed cumulatively. Thus, there may be slight differences in the formation of the cross sum. This is the description of the functionality of the module "kpiAuditor" with the name "KPI Auditors" regarding Definition of key figures: The definition of the key figures can best be explained by means of an example. Let the deviation of the confirmed delivery date from the requested date be a key figure for supplier evaluation. The key figure should not be the deviation in days itself, but a weighted value that results from the deviation. (0days = 10%; 1day=8%;2days=6%;.) The basis for determining a key figure is always a document (a transaction), in this example an order item. Data fields of an order item are both the requested delivery date and the delivery date confirmed by the supplier with his order confirmation. The difference between the two dates in days is also stored on the item as the data field confirmed.value. When setting the date of the order confirmation in the order item, the above key figure is processed in the following way: Via the transaction descriptions, first the data cube with the one dimension KPI Monitor of the KPI Auditor "Supplier rating" (determined via: Status Monitor -> Workflow(StateMonitor("CONFIRMATION").owner.ClearingObject("CX_KPI_AUDITOR").ForceMonitor(CX_KPI_MONITOR))) and the other dimension KPI Monitor of the supplier (reached via: TopTransaction().supplier.ForceMonitor(CX_KPI_MONITOR)) is determined/created. To determine an accrual-based KPI, the corresponding sub-accounts for the calendar year and month are then determined/created. In the KPI Auditor object, the desired key figures are defined and stored as calculated or conditional attributes. In our example, this is the attribute confirmed.numeric for the weighted deviation. This conditional attribute returns the weighted deviation as a numeric value 10, 8, 6 etc. depending on confirmed.value (the deviation in days between the requested and confirmed delivery date, which is/are stored on the order item itself (see above)). This value is determined via the transaction description (via: Status Monitor -> Workflow -> KPI Auditor(StateMonitor("CONFIRMATION").owner.ClearingObject("CX_KPI_AUDITOR").attributeSet.confirmed.counter)) and written away. The transaction description also stores the writing away of the key figure and the calculation of the new average. The following rules (an extract) should be included in the transaction description: The same rules apply for goods receipt (counter (received.kpiCounter) and evaluated deviation(received.kpiNumeric) between goods receipt date and confirmed delivery date (in days = received.value)) and key figures about the delivery quantity (delivered.kpi*).

This is the description of the functionality of the module "kpiAuditor" with the name "KPI Auditors" regarding Multidimensional OLAP cubes: The data collected via the KPI Auditor can also be collected and evaluated multi-dimensionally. For example, incoming orders can be evaluated according to sales area and article group. For this purpose, the orders are booked into an OLAP cube, which has the sales area and the article group as an edge/dimension. The period year and month can be sub-dimensions of this data cube. Through the OLAP cube, the turnover per sales area or per article group or per article group per sales area can be read directly in this example. Via the dimension filter that can be optionally set in the list, it is possible to filter the result set according to a dimension. In this way, for example, you can limit the evaluation to the data of a sales area and hide the other OLAP cubes. It is also possible to group dimensions. Let's assume there are the dimensions sales territory (India, China, Japan, Australia, Europe, America) and article group (services, spare parts, products). This would result in 15 data cubes. If you now want to evaluate "Service in Asia" with the corresponding dimensions (India, China, Japan - services, spare parts), this is not easily possible. The solution is a conditional attribute that creates a grouping of the dimensions. The evaluation can then be run via the column that results from this.

This is the description of the module "scanner_main_processes_outbound_shiptocustomer_pickandcollect_app_scanner" with the name "Scanner PickAndCollect customer": The warehouse employee selects a picking list and picks the goods from this picking list lying in his picking zone onto a picking cart or other picking container (pick container). As soon as the trolley/container is full or there are no further picks for this picking list in the picking zone, the warehouse worker places the trolley/container in a storage area for further processing. Usually this is a storage bin in one of the following storage areas Packing Winding Provision During storage, the warehouse employee is shown whether the goods need to be consolidated (e.g. because goods from other picking zones still need to be picked for this picking list) and whether goods from this picking list are already picked in another storage bin. The warehouse employee tries to place the goods in the same storage bin where goods from this picking list are already stored. The strategies for depositing are defined customer-specifically in each case. This is the description of the functionality of the module "scanner_main_processes_outbound_shiptocustomer_pickandcollect_app_scanner" with the name "Scanner PickAndCollect customer" regarding Pick list selection via ID: Choice of the picking list . This is the description of the functionality of the module "scanner_main_processes_outbound_shiptocustomer_pickandcollect_app_scanner" with the name "Scanner PickAndCollect customer" regarding Pick list selection via picking licence: Picked goods are stored as previously discussed in a storage location in one of the three zone types filed. Completely picked goods that leave with parcel services are deposited in the packing area, completely picked goods that leave with the forwarding agent are deposited in the wrapping zone. Goods that are not completely picked are normally placed in the staging area. If goods are in the staging area, a warehouse worker can continue the picking process for the pick list assigned to the goods by scanning one of the pick containers located in this zone. HESTIA then determines the pick list independently, i.e. the process of explicit pick list selection is omitted. This is exactly what the two menu items "Pick list selection via pick licence" and "Pick on pick licence" are intended for. The difference between the two processes is that with "Pick list selection via pick licence" the warehouse worker is prompted to use a new pick container (see "Pick container selection"), while with "Pick licence on" the warehouse worker picks up the already deposited pick container again and continues the picking process in it. In both cases, you can then continue with "Assign open picks". The two picking list options are possible with every picking container in the picking process that has been placed in a storage bin (so it does not necessarily have to be a storage bin in the consolidation zone). This is the description of the functionality of the module "scanner_main_processes_outbound_shiptocustomer_pickandcollect_app_scanner" with the name "Scanner PickAndCollect customer" regarding Continue picking licence (select pick container / assign open picks).: Picked goods are stored as previously discussed in a storage location in one of the three zone types Put away. Completely picked goods that leave with parcel services are deposited in the packing area, completely picked goods that leave with the forwarding agent are deposited in the wrapping zone. Goods that are not completely picked are normally placed in the provision zone. If goods are in the staging area, a warehouse worker can continue the picking process for the pick list assigned to the goods by scanning one of the pick containers located in this zone. HESTIA then determines the pick list independently, i.e. the process of explicit pick list selection is omitted. This is exactly what the two menu items "Pick list selection via pick licence" and "Pick on pick licence" are intended for. The difference between the two processes is that with "Pick list selection via pick licence" the warehouse worker is prompted to use a new pick container (see "Pick container selection"), while with "Pick on pick licence" the warehouse worker picks up the already deposited pick container and continues the picking process in it. In both cases, you can then continue with "Assign open picks".

This is the description of the functionality of the module "scanner_main_processes_outbound_shiptocustomer_pickandcollect_app_scanner" with the name "Scanner PickAndCollect customer" regarding Assign open picks: After a pick list has been selected, all open picks of this pick list in the selected pick zone are assigned to the warehouse worker. The warehouse worker is then asked to specify the pick container: All open picks of a pick zone can only be assigned to one warehouse worker at a time. This is the description of the functionality of the module "scanner_main_processes_outbound_shiptocustomer_pickandcollect_app_scanner" with the name "Scanner PickAndCollect customer" regarding Choice of pick container: The warehouse worker now scans an LHM or a picking trolley/box into which the picked goods are collected. If this PRT does not yet exist in the system (e.g. because the numbers are taken from a tear-off roll), the PRT is newly created in the system by specifying the PRT type (standard container). This is the description of the functionality of the module "scanner_main_processes_outbound_shiptocustomer_pickandcollect_app_scanner" with the name "Scanner PickAndCollect customer" regarding Store goods: If the picking process is ended (automatically or by means of "ESC") and goods were actually picked onto the pick container, the dialogue for depositing the goods appears.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_proctype" with the name "Provision" regarding Provision types: for this purpose the type of provision is specified. By default, the following staging types are defined in ClassiX®: For further documentation and testing purposes, the following table shows the process classification of (material) parts of different logistics and procurement types: (PRI = Product Item, PUI = Purchase Item; D = Disposed, S = Stock, M = Manual, R = Rest, J = JIT, C = Customer). This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_proctype" with the name "Provision" regarding Services: Services are also provided either by our own employees or by subcontractors. In this respect, the logistical marking is the same as for (material) parts (K = purchased service, F = service performed by the company itself). The types of provision are, however, reduced by all types of warehousing: For further documentation and testing purposes, the following table shows the process classification of services of different logistics and procurement types: (PRS = Product Service, PUS = Purchase Service; D = Disposed, J = JIT, C = Customer). This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_proctype" with the name "Provision" regarding Provisioning procedure: The different types of procurement also result in different provisioning procedures, which will be listed here schematically:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_proctype" with the name "Provision" regarding Disposition types and control of further processing of order items: An order item can be provided by 3 different disposition types: The current program status specifies that the further processing of a (warehouse) order item is controlled by the procurement type set in the part (logistics indicator and staging type). When released by the technical department, the next step is initiated (parts list exploded or requirement request made). There are basically two approaches to controlling further processing: However, if a part is now manufactured at low production capacity and purchased when bottlenecks occur, it is necessary to be able to control this further processing explicitly. In order to be able to convert a level 0 part before releasing the technology, it is only necessary to select the "target procurement type" via the menu Edit->Continue processing->Order/stock reservation/production order. The follow-on documents can then use the status of the order item to identify how this part is to be procured. No further tax code is required on the order item. Further processing:.

This is the description of the module "offoritt" with the name "Offer and order position": This module is used to maintain offer/order items. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offoritt" with the name "Offer and order position" regarding Order item status: First of all, once the order item has been created, the initial status is determined by the type of provision of the part. If the part has the staging type "no staging", the order item does not receive the staging status and no planning is initiated during technical release. Since order items can be scheduled differently, different statuses must also be assigned. These can then be used to identify how this order item is to be further processed and where it is to be provided from. Since the type of disposition is variable, the follow-up documents already created are used as recognition for the status into which the order item is to run. There are priorities which are to be explained here: 1st case: If an order item has an exploded production bill of material as a follow-on document, the order item goes into the production status, regardless of whether it still has a requirement request or a stock backlog as a partial disposition. 2nd case: If an order item does not have an exploded production BOM, but a requirement coverage request, the order item goes into the requirement coverage request status, even if it still has a stock backlog as a partial MRP. 3rd case: If an order item has a warehouse reservation document in full order item quantity, the order item goes into the warehouse reservation status. 4th case: If the order item has no follow-up documents at all and is a text article, the order item goes to the standard disposition status set in the client, which was defined there for text articles. 5th case: If an order item has no follow-up documents at all and is not a text article, the standard disposition type of the part is taken over for the order item. So if the part is a purchased part that is subject to MRP, a requirement coverage request is created during technical release. Please note the following: The order item status only goes into "purchase requisition" if there is already a successor document. Before this, however, the rules (case 4+5) in the technical release window are used to determine which follow-on document must be created automatically for a technical release and which buttons are displayed as standard. In case 4+5, only the buttons of the standard disposition type are displayed in the technical release. For cases 1-3, the buttons of the planning type resulting from the follow-on documents are displayed according to the priority mentioned. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. What types of provisions can affect the initial status of an order item in Offer and order position?
2. How do different statuses assist in identifying how an order item is to be further processed in Offer and order position?
3. Can you explain the concept of "staging" in relation to order items in Offer and order position, and what happens when the staging type is "no staging"?
4. How do follow-up documents influence the status of an order item in Offer and order position, specifically in regards to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th cases described in the module description?
5. Can you elaborate on the distinction between "requirement coverage request" and "stock backlog" as partial dispositions in Offer and order position, and how they impact the status of an order item?
6. How does the warehouse reservation document affect the status of an order item in Offer and order position, and under what circumstances would an order item go into the warehouse reservation status?
7. In what situations might an order item go directly to the standard disposition status without going through any of the other statuses in Offer and order position?
8. Can you describe the relationship between the standard disposition type of a part and the order item status in Offer and order position, particularly in cases where the part is a purchased part subject to MRP?
9. How do the rules in the technical release window work in determining which follow-on document is created automatically for a technical release in Offer and order position?
10. What kind of buttons are displayed as standard in the technical release window depending on the case, and how do these buttons relate to the planning type resulting from the follow-on documents?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "offoritt" with the name "Offer and order position" regarding Attributes in the subheadings: General Attributes are data of the order item, which take on both controlling and informative functions. The attributes can be used to break down/define the variant part that is possibly hidden behind the order item, to determine the price on the basis of a price table or to send information to the customer by printing the attributes. Local and global attributes Local attributes are created directly in the order item and can therefore be used once for this document and all subsequent documents. After creation, they can be changed in their form directly (right click) via the editing mask. Global attributes are either taken directly from the sales item or can be inserted from the attribute master. In contrast to the local attributes, they can only be edited to a limited extent. Usually this means only the value and the comment. The remaining specifications, such as changing a stored table, can only be made in the attribute master. In order processing, there is the peculiarity that not all attributes hold their value. These attributes are marked by the globe with the red tripod and are caused by the fact that at the time of inserting the attribute, a superior item has the same attribute. In this case, the attribute of the sub-item takes the value from the main item. If the value of the attribute of the main item is subsequently changed, it is passed on to all sub-items. This happens until the value of the attribute of the sub-item has been manually changed once. From this point on, the value is constant and the attribute is displayed with a globe with a yellow tripod. If the attribute values have been set to be displayed as calculated in the option window, the spontaneously calculated value of the attribute appears in the "Value" column instead of the formula. Supplier No. Attribute If you double-click on the attribute "supplier no." or "supplierID", the system checks whether the value entered in this attribute corresponds to a name of a supplier and takes over the number of the first matching supplier. If none could be found, the supplier search mask opens. After selecting a supplier, the supplier number is entered in the value of the attribute. When saving an order item, the system searches for "supplier number" attributes on the order item that have not yet been converted into a supplier number. This is now done. If a supplier has been found, the attribute is marked accordingly and the next time the order item is saved, no further attempt is made to find it again. In requisitions and orders for parts that do not have an A-supplier, the supplier with the number specified in supplierID is used! In this way, it is possible for order parts without a main supplier to determine at the time of order entry which supplier is to be ordered from. (see also description of price determination for order items). Determining the origin of a global attribute with red tripod Determining the original attribute makes sense if an attribute inherits the value from another attribute (). If you now want to find out afterwards in which position the attribute was found, you can call up the function via the context menu. Transfer of the attributes into the order The respective red arrow shows which value is accepted and which attribute is wrapped. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offoritt" with the name "Offer and order position" regarding Calculation and quantity calculation for main and sub-items: There are five types (Types) of how subitems are assembled with the main item (see the "Type" field displayed on the first tab "Offer/Order item" if a main item has been loaded); this defines the pricing rules and quantity calculation. The types are explained using the following example (see also the explanations of the Sales Set module). 
Sure, I'd be happy to assist you! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. Can local attributes be modified after creation?
2. What happens when a global attribute's value is altered in the attribute master?
3. How do attributes affect the pricing of offer and order positions?
4. Which type of assembly is utilized for calculating quantities in the Offer and Order Position module?
5. Is it possible to transfer attributes into an order?
6. How does the system handle supplier numbers in requisition and purchase orders?
7. Can the origin of a global attribute with a red tripod be determined later?
8. Are there any limitations on modifying global attributes?
9. Does the system support displaying calculated values for attributes in the "value" column?
10. Can the system perform automatic searches for suppliers based on attribute values?

Please note that these queries are generated based solely on the provided module description; thus, they must be answered exclusively using the module description.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "offoritt" with the name "Offer and order position" regarding Price calculation: The order processing in ClassiX not only offers extensive and variable possibilities to calculate or create prices, but also the highest possible degree of clarity. This is necessary because the price is usually not only a simple value per quantity, which is stored in the sales item, but is calculated by various factors. These factors include, for example, over/under prices, discounts/surcharges, list price-related conditions, customer group discounts and customer article group discounts. Unless a position is below a position/group with a fixed total, a slot accounted.amount is saved, in which the values of the order position can be viewed divided. The values are the following: Definitions of terms Regular price / regular price assumption When selecting a sales article role (sales article, sales set, spare part, etc.), a master sales price and master costs are transferred to the item according to the following rules: Because the attribute values in the quotation or order could be changed later, it is then ensured that the sales price or basic costs are compared with master data. There are the following possibilities: surcharges/discounts Since each item can have several surcharges and discounts, the order of the conditions is important when it comes to percentage conditions. The reason for this is that the conditions are calculated cumulatively. It should also be noted that absolute conditions (-100€) also affect the unit price. It is therefore multiplied, like all other conditions in the items, by the quantity stored for the item. List price related conditions List price related conditions can be used to hide surcharges. When the order confirmation is printed, the customer is informed of the list price, the "normal" conditions granted and the resulting unit price. However, he is not informed about the composition of the list price and the conditions that are included. List price-related conditions can be created in an order item as percentage or value per quantity surcharges. They are then referred to as additional or reduced prices. In an order group or the order itself, list price-related conditions can only be entered as a percentage. They are then taken into account in all items, but are not shown. Thus the surcharge is hidden in such a way that the calculation in print is also plausible for the customer. List price-related conditions in sets In contrast to the list price related conditions in an item (over/under prices), in an order group or the order itself, the application to a set item (sales set, BG set) is more differentiated. In the normal sales item position, the condition is only applied to the item itself. In the order or a group, only to the associated items. In a set with sub-items, the item category controls how the prices are calculated and therefore also the scope of the conditions. The following combinations of item category, condition type and list price-related labelling are available:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offoritt" with the name "Offer and order position" regarding Cost calculation: Definitions of terms. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offoritt" with the name "Offer and order position" regarding Revenue calculation: Subsequent to the calculation of the whole offer/order, the revenue calculation is carried out: Revenues are calculated and stored on the individual offer/order items (and also on all other nodes such as item groups and the document itself). An item revenue is understood to be a corrected item net value, whereby the corrections take into account all other net-related conditions as well as the deviation by a fixed sum. This means that the sum of all revenue values of sub-items is always equal to the net value on the respective item. Example 1 (the simplest situation): Example 2 (fixed sum): Example 3 (total net discount): Example 4 (net position discount): Example 5 (net packaging surcharge): Example 6 (complex):. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offoritt" with the name "Offer and order position" regarding Further processing: Follow-up documents Sales and technical approval Order items are created by the sales department (on the road). Then all the background information for this job is obtained and saved. Only when the sales department knows that this order item can now be scheduled, the sales person releases the order item via the "Sales release". This step has the following implications: The next step is the technical release by the work preparation or the scheduler. Partial delivery A delivery schedule can be entered for an order item. These dates give you the following options Disposition An order item with a text article always receives a disposition status. An order item does not get an MRP status in the order if the item: - is a service item or - is subordinate to an assembly set item; or - is a PID item or - is a sales set item. Otherwise, the item gets a disposition status if the (possibly distinct) part on the item is a non-dispositional part. Otherwise (the part is a disposition part), the item gets a disposition status if: - the part is a purchase part or - the part is a production part and has a production role or is an assembly set.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "offoritt" with the name "Offer and order position" regarding Conditional individual parts in sets: If a set contains conditional subparts, a message appears when selecting such a set into an order or quotation item, stating that at least one conditional part is present. Since the selection of conditional components depends on the characteristics specified in the item under the tab Additional Data, these must first be set accordingly. When this has been done, the button "Generate plant components" must be pressed, which then inserts the conditional components into the position using the set characteristics. The characteristics created in the corresponding set for a subpart are taken over. If these have not been entered, the system takes the characteristics from the parts master. Entries not relevant for an item can then be manually removed. See also the option for enabling recursive resolution. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offoritt" with the name "Offer and order position" regarding preliminary calculation: In the order position, it is possible to determine the margin or contribution margin of the position using calculatory standard prices. To do this, the standard price from the order item roll is drawn into the base cost field for purchased parts and the standard price from the production roll of the selected part for production parts. This can be changed manually to see how certain price changes affect the preliminary calculation. However, the orders or requisitions resulting from this order item remain unaffected by this change. It has no effect on the further course of procurement of the part. Trade goods parts The four possibilities of transfer from the trading goods database:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offoritt" with the name "Offer and order position" regarding Overview: Storage reservation for a part with extra indication of a non-disposable storage location: (Techn. doc.) If a storage bin is selected in an order item that is not MRP, then the order item is not recorded in the MRP account of the part!!! Validity and last.itemPointer Each time an order item is booked, the part that is hidden behind the roll is determined and saved in last.itemPointer. This is necessary because due to attribute changes (variant parts) and validity (exchange objects) the salesItem.item object is not always the corresponding part and can be regarded as constant. The following list describes how the part (last.itemPointer) is determined. last.itemPointer is always set, even if the variant part cannot be resolved. Unless it is a text item. last.itemPointer is frozen when the order item has been technically released or has relevant successors. Relevant successors are: - Production parts lists - Stock return documents - Requisitions/purchase orders that are not a work order or have been cancelled. If after last.itemPointer has been frozen by the above-mentioned conditions, an attempt is made to change a condition that could affect last.itemPointer, the user will receive a corresponding message.

The sales accounts of the sales article and the customer must be transferred in any case. The monitor is determined from the accounts with Call(DataCubeCore). The monitor is transferred with the messages CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_CHANGED and CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_CREATED to update the list. If NULL was transferred on the Stack Top, it is checked whether a customer agreement already exists for the 2 transferred Sale Accounts. In the macro CreateObject againCall(DataCubeCore) with TRUE to create the monitor if it does not exist. Then the sales account of the sales article is wrapped and a price value per quantity is created. DELETE_CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT: The monitor containing the customer agreement to be deleted is transferred. If no customer agreement is found, an error message appears. Afterwards the wrapper of the sales article Sale Account is removed and the message CUSTOMER_AGREEMENT_DELETED is sent with the monitor as transfer parameter.

This module is used for the display/further processing of parts to be provided or already provided within the logistics supply chain in a company. On the one hand, it is possible to differentiate between external demand triggers (sales order items) or internal demand triggers (storage and production orders). (For further selection options according to storage bins or only open documents, see below) A provision must therefore be made not only for the dispatch of goods, but also within the company within the framework of production. To be provided: Depending on the logistical identification (purchased or manufactured part) and the type of provision (non-stock-keeping or stock-keeping with corresponding special forms such as JIT, etc.) of a part, parts are supplied to the logistical business process from The programmatic execution of the provision from purchase requisitions - carried out by employees of the incoming goods department - and the provision from production orders - possibly carried out by employees of a final inspection - are not absolutely necessary, but they facilitate the control over the whereabouts of parts. The provision from stock reservations - carried out by employees of the warehouse - leads in the standard system to the creation of stock withdrawal documents (stock removal documents). If the corresponding programme steps for provision have been carried out, the part requests are automatically transferred to the next state (status): Provided: Analogous to the states of the parts to be provided, the following states result here The state "dispatch" stands for those parts which are sent directly from the warehouse to dispatch for customer orders.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_foreigncurrency" with the name "Foreign currency" regarding Introduction: In a globalised economy one is constantly confronted with foreign languages and foreign currencies. In this section we will look at foreign currencies and describe how currencies are processed in the CyberEnterprise business OS. But first, some definitions of terms: The local currency (or standard currency) is the currency that is set as the currency of the registered client, i.e. the currency in which the client prepares his balance sheet: All internal values (e.g. all bookings and accounts of the accounting system (financial, operational and asset accounting) or statistical values such as turnover or costs) are kept in this currency. Foreign currencies are all other currencies that can be used as desired within the CyberEnterprise business OS: In transaction data (e.g. in offers, orders, invoices, etc.) and also in master data (e.g. in supplier prices, sales prices, etc.). The conversion between currencies is controlled via currency tables. The currency covered is the currency in which currency or monetary amounts are recorded in the system. The output currency is the currency in which documents (e.g. quotations, order confirmation, invoice, credit note, etc.) are printed. In outgoing and incoming invoices or in other documents whose values must be converted into the internal local currency, the output currency is also referred to as the conversion currency, since it must be taken into account here not only for the preparation of the print, but also for the transfer to the internal accounting system (e.g. when creating open items in financial accounting). In the following tables, € is the local currency and $ is any foreign currency. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_foreigncurrency" with the name "Foreign currency" regarding Foreign currencies in sales: An offer/order or invoice/credit note can only be entered in one currency. The following table lists, among other things, the effect of a foreign currency on financial accounting and its open items (see also here) In all cases, the currency details of the order can be overwritten in the invoice. For example, order type C can become an invoice of type B, if the user so specifies. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_foreigncurrency" with the name "Foreign currency" regarding Manual account assignment of invoices with foreign currencies: (see also: Manual account assignment) In case B, that is, if the invoice has been entered in the local currency but issued in a different currency, the issue currency and the exchange rate can be changed in the Manual Account Assignment window even after the invoice has been registered. If a different, possibly more up-to-date exchange rate has been agreed upon with the customer after registration but before posting in the financial accounting, this can still be maintained. If the invoice was entered in a foreign currency, the conversion rate can be changed in the manual account assignment, but not the conversion currency. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_foreigncurrency" with the name "Foreign currency" regarding Setting the: While when registering an invoice, the conversion rate must always be set if a foreign currency is used (this rate can either be set manually or is set automatically (see also here)), this can be made more open during order/invoice processing. At least you have the options whether the exchange rate should be frozen or whether the current exchange rate, defined via the global currency table, should always be used for calculation. The setting, which should be used by default, can also be set via the options. When the documents are output, the output currency and, if applicable, its exchange rate is transferred to the print template. However, the specifications can be changed here for printing. When creating a follow-on document [[Quotation -> New quotation version -> Order -> Invoice -> Credit note], the print currency and, if applicable, the exchange rate are automatically adopted. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_foreigncurrency" with the name "Foreign currency" regarding Foreign currencies in sales prices: In the section Foreign currencies as output currency (print currency) in sales it was shown which problems occur when converting from the local currency to the output currency(calculation currency of the order -conversion-> customer). In this section, the influence of a foreign currency in the sales prices on the order calculation(sales prices -conversion-> calculation currency of the order) is discussed. Local currency: currency of the client Calculation currency: The currency with which the order is calculated. (The currency specified by the net value of the order). Output currency: The currency in which the order is output (printed) and which is transferred as a foreign currency together with a frozen rate in the financial accounting. The problems to be considered include the following: The following cases thus arise for the use of sales prices in the order in different currencies. For all the above cases, € is the local currency and a fixed conversion rate of $1.25 to €1.00 is defined in the valid SALESFX. It can be defined in the client whether a currency table (SALESFX or local) must exist if the calculation currency of the order or the currency of a sales price in a foreign currency is used. If this option is set, an error message will be displayed if this is not the case. If the option is not set, the EUROFX table is used for conversion and the above-mentioned currency fluctuations occur. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. How do I enter an offer/order or invoice/credit note in a foreign currency?
2. Can I overwrite the currency details of an invoice if it was originally entered in a different currency?
3. What happens if I change the exchange rate after an invoice has been registered but before it is posted in financial accounting?
4. Can I set the conversion rate to be frozen or use the current exchange rate defined in the global currency table for calculations?
5. How do I set the output currency and exchange rate for printing documents related to a foreign currency?
6. What are the implications of using a foreign currency in sales prices on the order calculation?
7. How do I handle currency fluctuations when using sales prices in different currencies?
8. Is there an option to require a currency table (such as SALESFX or local) for orders or sales prices in foreign currencies?
9. What happens if I enter an order in one currency but issue an invoice in another currency?
10. Can I modify the conversion currency or exchange rate for an invoice after it has been registered?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_foreigncurrency" with the name "Foreign currency" regarding Foreign currencies in purchasing: In purchasing, the documents most commonly used are purchase orders and purchase invoices, where foreign currencies play a role. However, there is a significant difference between this and sales. While in sales documents (quotations, orders, A/R invoices) - at least in most cases - the sales prices are recorded in the local currency and a foreign currency + exchange rate is "only" used for the output of prices in print, this is different in purchasing. Here the documents themselves (order, incoming invoice) are entered in a foreign currency: An incoming invoice which is received in $, for example, should of course also be entered in $. So if an incoming invoice is entered in a foreign currency, the corresponding exchange rate MUST be indicated. The reason for this can be found in the initial account assignment, which is always made in the local currency. If the exchange rate were not frozen, there would be differences between the account assignment and the gross value if the exchange rate in the currency table were to change. An order or an incoming invoice/credit note can only be entered in one currency. The following table lists the effect of a foreign currency on financial accounting and its open items (see also here):. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_foreigncurrency" with the name "Foreign currency" regarding Foreign currencies in financial accounting: In principle, the accounts of the financial accounting are managed in the local currency, which is fixed in the client. However, it is necessary to be able to process and post outgoing and incoming invoices, outgoing and incoming payments and foreign currency accounts in different foreign currencies. A/R invoice documents and A/R credit memo documents are converted into the local currency at the time of registration (the time of automatic or later manual preassignment) (see Foreign Currencies in Sales), and the conversion rate is determined for A/P invoice documents and A/P credit memo documents when they are entered (see Foreign Currencies in Purchasing). The conversion rates already defined in the pre-defined documents are transferred to financial accounting. The further processing of automatically imported bank statements in financial accounting is described in the section Foreign Currencies in Bank Statements, but first follows a description of the processing of foreign currencies in manual postings. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_foreigncurrency" with the name "Foreign currency" regarding Foreign currencies for manual bookings: The debit or credit value of an entry can be entered in any foreign currency, as long as a conversion rate into the local currency is available. If a currency table is logged in, the exchange rate - as far as it is available in the currency table as exchange rate into the local currency - is automatically determined and the foreign currency amount is converted into an amount in local currency. This automatically determined amount can also be maintained manually by means of a special setting. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_foreigncurrency" with the name "Foreign currency" regarding Foreign currencies in bank statements: When bank statements from bank accounts with foreign currency are taken over or bank postings with incoming or outgoing payments in foreign currency are made, an immediate conversion into the local currency is carried out as a preliminary step to posting in the financial accounting. If this conversion is to take place using the date of the bank statement, this must be stored in the client.

This is the description of the module "statprpl" with the name "Production planning orders": This list should be the basis for the coordination between sales and production and thus the starting point for the timely scheduling of sales orders in production. Furthermore, it offers the possibility to evaluate the commissioned, performed or still to be performed service of a production company as a whole (see option Performance). As a basis for this production planning, sales order items can be listed here by means of various global selection criteria (see Tabular parts, characteristics, other restrictions) or direct individual selection. The core data displayed includes customer, parts, quantity, price and date information for the individual items. In addition, the resource allocation (which can be switched on and off via an option) can be listed (also controllable via an option as target, actual and open times). Since by default a sorting according to the production date of the individual items with corresponding subtotals is carried out, a target, actual or still open debit of the production from sales orders is displayed, sorted by date. This is the description of the functionality of the module "statprpl" with the name "Production planning orders" regarding Functionality: Listing of sales order items either according to various selection criteria or by direct selection. Display of value and time data to determine future, already performed or commissioned services.

This is the description of the module "cxCounter" with the name "Counter": Counters are used to maintain all number ranges (registers) used in the system. Counters are required for master data (customers, G/L accounts, parts, etc.) and documents (invoices, orders, purchase orders, etc.) in order to specify sequential numbering. The formatting of the number (e.g. whether with or without leading zeros) is also determined in the counter. Usually, the name of the meter is the same as the class name of the object to be numbered (e.g. CX_CUSTOMER for the customer number meter). The register of a counter can be delegated to the register of another counter. This is used, for example, if the number range for outgoing invoices and outgoing credit memos is to be the same. In this case, the counter for A/R credit notes (CX_CREDIT_NOTE) is delegated to the counter for A/R invoices (CX_INVOICE). A conditional table can also be used to distribute a register to several other counters, e.g. if the number range for orders is to be different depending on the order type.If you want to reset the counters for e.g. A/R invoices at the beginning of a fiscal year, you can create (copy) a separate counter for each fiscal year - controlled by the validity. In this way, for example, the counter "CX_INVOICE" for A/R invoices would then exist several times, each with a validity related to the fiscal year. It should be noted that the counter number should include the year of the fiscal year in order to avoid double numbers. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxCounter" with the name "Counter" regarding Input window: This window is used for maintaining meters. You can select a meter by entering the desired meter name in the Name field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to open the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". Several number ranges can also be combined by 'delegation'. In addition, your number ranges can also be displayed with a format specification, for example to define leading zeros or similar. In this way, any format changes that may be necessary in the future can be made centrally and therefore with little effort. In the field 'Control character' you specify the formatting of the respective number range (in the example: six numeric digits) and in the field 'Fixed text' you control how the number is displayed in the input fields (in the example: six digits, numeric with leading zeros). This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxCounter" with the name "Counter" regarding List window: Used to list the counters. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxCounter" with the name "Counter" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select a counter. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxCounter" with the name "Counter" regarding Test formatting: In this window you can test the formatting of a counter. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxCounter" with the name "Counter" regarding Search number range: In this window you can display the corresponding objects by entering a range of numbers. In this way you can quickly find out how many and which objects are in which number ranges. The search extends over the master list of objects (REP collection) specified in the "Class" field or - if nothing is specified there - the class name is taken from the name of the selected meter. If no "data field" is specified, the field "uniqueID" is taken. In particular, this search also serves to display any gaps in the specified number range. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxCounter" with the name "Counter" regarding Edit number range manually: A counter object is used - as the name suggests - to automatically count up order or invoice numbers, for example. A counter object can also be used to format number fields. It often happens that you want to manage number ranges manually, because they are assigned and processed externally (e.g. externally assigned inventory numbers). To get an overview of such number ranges, you can manage these "reservations" here.

This is the description of the module "purchinv" with the name "Incoming invoice": General overview of the workflow of incoming invoices General procedure for processing incoming invoices Reasons for inspection Account assignment VAT invoice Determining the invoice quantity Recording of a penalty (contractual penalty) Incoming invoice capture via scanned documents General information The main task of this module is the recording of the incoming invoices of the vendors and forms the basis of the overall task, the processing of the incoming invoices. This results in further subtasks such as checking the invoice, making the initial account assignment and posting in the financial accounting. ClassiX® supports this process by an ergonomic, semi-automatic capture of the incoming invoice. By means of an automated check, which presents the invoices to be checked directly to the respective employees for checking, the time delay caused by transport and communication between the departments/employees involved is minimised. Due to the assignment of the incoming invoice via the document history to the demand triggers, the initial account assignment is also carried out automatically. the posting to the financial accounting is carried out via the invoice receipt book. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchinv" with the name "Incoming invoice" regarding General overview of the workflow of incoming invoices: {img type="fileId" fileId="422" thumb="box" width="100%"}. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. What is the primary function of the "purchinv" module?
2. Can you describe the general procedure for processing incoming invoices within the "purchinv" module?
3. How does the "purchinv" module handle account assignation for incoming invoices?
4. Does the "purchinv" module support automatic posting to the financial accounting system? If so, how?
5. Can you elaborate on the document history feature in the "purchinv" module and its role in assigning demands to trigger the initial account assignment?
6. Are there any automated checks within the "purchinv" module to verify the accuracy of incoming invoices before they are processed?
7. Is it possible to scan and upload documents directly into the "purchinv" module for easier inputting of invoices?
8. Can you provide examples of reasons for inspecting incoming invoices within the "purchinv" module?
9. How does the "purchinv" module determine the quantity of an invoice when processing it?
10. Are penalties or contractual penalties supported within the "purchinv" module for late payments or other violations?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchinv" with the name "Incoming invoice" regarding General procedure for processing incoming invoices: 1. invoice receipt / options Entering an incoming invoice begins outside the ClassiX® system by assigning a paging number. The stack of invoices to be entered should now be sorted by this number. This way, the "Date of receipt" and the "Auto. Pagination number", which are set automatically when each invoice is entered. The pagination number is incremented after each invoice and is then updated when the next invoice is entered. Thus the invoice stack should be sorted according to the LiFo principle (last in first out), i.e. the invoice with the smallest pagination number is always on top. 2. create a new incoming invoice The creation of a new incoming invoice in ClassiX starts with pressing the button NEW and entering the header data. The focus is now in the field Invoice number and jumps by RETURN to the field Invoice date. 3. creating the incoming invoice items Again via RETURN you can now access the order field. By entering and triggering the purchase order number to which the incoming invoice refers, the incoming invoice is created, the pagination number and the date of receipt are transferred according to the options and the vendor according to the purchase order. However, the most important part of this step is the creation of incoming invoice items according to the purchase order. Subsequently, further orders can be triggered if the supplier has invoiced several orders at the same time. 4. input of the invoice amounts For the sake of efficiency, the invoice amounts are recorded in a separate window. For the invoice header, these would be the service charges, the tax value and the invoice value. The net value is then calculated from the difference. In addition, service charges can also be recorded at the order level. This is particularly relevant if several orders from the supplier have been combined in one invoice. The input tax is attempted to be determined automatically on the basis of the supplier and is offered as a pre-selection. If the tax is overwritten, it is not only copied into the header, but also to all newly created items. In addition, the order conditions are displayed and can be exchanged here if the creditor has referred to other conditions. If freight and packaging are taken over as additional costs via the order, a note appears in the quick comparison window so that these costs are not entered twice. The order header conditions are also transferred to the incoming invoice. Only if all conditions of the purchase orders also appear in the incoming invoice, the ER can be released automatically. The additional costs reappear in the incoming invoice as conditions, whereby the additional costs of the order item level are distributed by value to the items just created automatically. When deleting items, the ancillary costs are then distributed again. As a result, you can no longer maintain the distributed conditions via the item mask, but only the originally created item ancillary costs. There is an extra window for this, which you open via the menu Edit -> Conditions -> Edit additional costs. Two columns are displayed. On the one hand the value of the service charge item, which can be maintained via OboxEdit, and on the other hand the items to which the service charge item refers. The distributed value is shown in brackets after each item. 5. capture "free positions A free incoming invoice item is used to record those incoming invoices which cannot be recorded in the regular way. A free incoming invoice item must always be entered manually. Another special feature is that it never goes directly to the "released" status, but must always be checked beforehand. Furthermore, it has no influence on an order status, as the items are entered without quantity. Free items can only be entered if the invoice has already been created. Therefore you should save at least once and already have the vendor, paging number, etc. A free position can now be created via the "Insert" button and the "Free position" menu that opens. In case the invoice cannot be assigned to a ClassiX® order at all, all data of the item must be set manually. Otherwise, for example an order header can be selected as predecessor. In this case, among other things, the vendor is transferred to the invoice header, if this has not yet been done at this point. If the data is not sufficient for the examiner, the description field can also be used. The field "invoice quantity" remains permanently closed for this type of entry. Thus the invoice item has no influence on the invoice status of the order. 6. release cycle The next step is to advance ("release") the incoming invoice. If no item is displayed in the item list with a stop sign, which stands for a manual check, the invoice goes directly to the status "released" by advancing and can thus be transferred to the financial accounting. Otherwise, all items that could not be automatically released are presented to the inspectors for checking. (see test reasons) In addition, a rule (recognition rule) can be stored in the client, which automatically accepts an invoice. The rule could for example be: "The net value of the invoice is less than 100€". If an invoice has been entered to which the rule applies, a checkbox "Accept invoice" opens next to the "Release" button, which is clicked by default. A set checkbox means that the invoice will still be checked, but not in the manual check. Instead, the invoice is released directly. The rule mentioned as an example thus leads to the fact that all invoices under 100€ can be directly released and thus paid, although there are reasons for checking (e.g.: open goods receipt). If you would like to have an invoice checked despite the rule, the tick must be removed from the checkbox. Incoming invoices that are directly recognised do not have to be approved, even if the licensing regulations provide for this. 6.1 Checking a position If there are reasons (see reasons for checking) which prohibit the automatic release of an incoming invoice item, this invoice is presented to the auditors for manual release. In addition, the person entering the incoming invoice can also mark an item as "to be checked", although no defined reasons for checking apply. Items with the status "Check" are usually released by the inspector (field in the item mask). He finds his incoming invoices to be checked in his activity folder. All fields are blocked for the verifier, as he should only have the possibility to block or release the incoming invoice. If he blocks an item, the entire incoming invoice is also blocked. Otherwise it is checked whether all items have been released. If this is the case, the incoming invoice is also released for posting. The auditor shall be provided with his own tool for checking the incoming invoices to be audited. (see here).

9. What is the purpose of the "free positions" function in the "purchinv" module, and when would I use it?
10. Can I add additional costs to an incoming invoice item in the "purchinv" module, and how do I do it?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchinv" with the name "Incoming invoice" regarding VAT invoice: As a rule, the tax key is stored both in the incoming invoice header and in the items, whereby only one tax key may be used in the whole invoice. This is different for overtax invoices. Here, the incoming invoice header is not assigned a tax key at all, which means that different taxes can be entered in the items. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchinv" with the name "Incoming invoice" regarding Account assignment: Topic on the subject of "accounting/pre-assignment Four values are required for the account assignment of an incoming invoice, which are set in the ER items. An absolute must is the financial accounting account and the amount. The financial accounting account can be either a G/L account or a cost element, if the cost element account assignment is permitted by the settings in the client. The other values are the cost centre and the cost unit. The financial accounting account is usually specified directly in the order item role and is set automatically when the item is entered. An exception are text articles, for example, where a "default" cost element is stored in the client. The same also applies to the account assignment of service charges. Important notes: The automatic account assignment can be changed manually in the invoice receipt book. Once this has been done, the invoice can no longer be changed via the editing screen. With the cost unit account assignment, an attempt is made to determine the exact share of the cost unit items in an incoming invoice. If one or more cost object predecessors have no quantities because it is the order header or a group, the remaining quantity (BA quantity - sum of the cost object quantities) is divided proportionally among the remaining items without quantities. If an overdelivery/underdelivery (BA quantity > or < sum of cost object quantities and there are no items without quantities) takes place, the total costs are divided on the basis of the number of predecessors, since it is not possible to assign the over quantity exactly to a cost object item. The value of the delivery schedule(s) is decisive for the cost allocation of a free item. If a free item has one or more purchase orders as predecessors, all delivery schedules of these purchase orders are taken into account. When releasing or forwarding incoming invoices, the account assignment is checked for the presence of a cost object or cost centre if the cost type insists on a cost object or cost centre constraint. Account assignment of an (EU) income tax A purchase tax of, for example, 16% is treated as 0% in the incoming invoices and only affects the account assignment. The created posting container for the tax has the value zero externally (display in the invoice receipt book etc.), but internally in the financial accounting the 16% value is used for calculation. Manual account assignment of an (EU) income tax. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchinv" with the name "Incoming invoice" regarding Determining the invoice quantity: The invoice quantity is attempted to be determined automatically in order to save time during data entry. The following quantities serve as a basis for the determination: - Order quantity - Delivery quantities - QA quantities (for QA parts) - invoiced quantity (quantity already invoiced by the supplier) The invoice quantity is determined according to the following logic. No QS parts: QA parts: Attention! It can only be attempted to determine the quantity invoiced by the supplier, there is of course no 100% certainty. Therefore, the invoiced quantity should be checked manually to avoid errors. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchinv" with the name "Incoming invoice" regarding Recording of a penalty (contractual penalty): The penalty is a contractual penalty or also a contractual penalty for non-performance or poor performance of deliveries and services and is designed as a fine. The recording of a penalty differs from other invoices in purchasing in that the penalty is to be regarded as income and not as expense. Thus, when assigning an account, a revenue account instead of an expense account and a VAT account instead of an input tax account must be addressed. The selection of the revenue account on the item does not differ from normal incoming invoices. However, the selection of a VAT key must first be enabled via the options. The penalty should be recorded as a credit note with positive values and a value added tax. The posting record for a contractual penalty of 100€ then looks like the following: For the entry of the penalty, it is advisable to have a free position which is assigned to the order header as a predecessor. 
Sure, I'd be happy to assist you with generating realistic questions based on the given module description! Here are some potential questions that could be asked related to the "Incoming Invoice" functionality of the "purchinv" module:

1. What is the purpose of storing the tax key both in the incoming invoice header and in the items, and how does this impact the account assignment process?
2. Can you explain the difference between overtax invoices and regular invoices in regards to the account assignment process?
3. How do you handle situations where there are multiple cost objects or centres associated with a single invoice, and how do you allocate costs accordingly?
4. Can you provide examples of scenarios where manual account assignment might be necessary, and what factors might influence this decision?
5. How does the system determine the invoice quantity, and what sources does it draw upon to make this determination?
6. What is the purpose of the "invoiced quantity" field, and how does it factor into the overall invoice quantity determination process?
7. Can you walk me through the process of recording a penalty as a contractual penalty, and how does this differ from recording other types of incomes?
8. Are there any specific considerations or best practices for selecting the appropriate revenue and VAT accounts when recording a penalty?
9. How does the system handle cases where a penalty is recorded as a credit note with positive values and VAT?
10. Can you provide guidance on how to properly assign a free position to an order header as a predecessor for the purposes of entering a penalty?

I hope these questions cover the relevant aspects of the module description and are helpful in understanding the functionality of the "Incoming Invoice" feature within the "purchinv" module!

This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchinv" with the name "Incoming invoice" regarding Incoming invoice capture via scanned documents: When entering incoming invoices using scanned documents, it is assumed that the invoices are already available in a scanned form in a register. The scanned incoming invoices and incoming credit notes must be stored in separate directories. These directories are defined in the client. In addition, two directories must be defined in which the scanned documents are moved and archived. The directories shall be defined according to the following scheme: Path for scanned incoming invoices : Z :\classix\IncomingInvoices\*.pdf Path for incoming invoices to be processed: Z:\classix\InvoicesReceived\InProcess\. Path for incoming invoices to be archived: Z:\classix\IncomingInvoices\Archive\ It is important that the path to the scanned incoming invoices also includes the type of document (pdf, tif, etc.), as other files, such as text files with the contents read from the documents, can also be stored here. To prevent the folder of archived incoming invoices from becoming too full and thus confusing, there is the option "Move archived scanned documents to subfolders (year-month)". With this option, further subfolders with the designation "yyyy-mm" are created below the folder. Thus the folder "2013-01" stands for January 2013. The incoming invoices are moved to the archived folder if they have been booked or rejected in the financial accounting. For invoices that have been booked into the financial accounting, the posting date of the financial accounting successor is decisive for the creation and moving into a subfolder. For rejected incoming invoices, it is the invoice date. The file name must correspond to the pagination number of the invoice/credit note. The file name can additionally begin with "ER" or "EG" to determine the type of document via the name. However, the documents are distinguished by the different directory and not by this abbreviation. When determining the pagination number, any existing abbreviation is omitted. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchinv" with the name "Incoming invoice" regarding Automatic creation of incoming invoices: When opening the editing mask, a check is made to ensure that scanned documents to be imported are in the appropriate directory. If this is the case, this is indicated in the toolbar by a "GO" character ( ) and the number of documents to be imported is displayed, otherwise a "STOP" sign ( ) are shown. The import is started by pressing the "Go" sign. Then the file with the smallest pagination number is searched for in the directory of the invoices to be imported. If no pagination number with a valid format could be found or if the pagination number was already used, the process is cancelled. The next step is to move the file to the archive directory. If there is a file with the same name and the extension ".txt" in the directory, this file is also moved into the archive directory. Next, a new invoice is created with the determined pagination number and the file moved to the archive directory is associated with it. This is done by means of local document references. The document is also opened automatically so that the invoice data can be determined and transferred to the incoming invoice mask. The document associated with the invoice can be edited at any time using the toolbar button for editing associations ( ) can be opened. If the scanned content of the incoming invoice document was placed in a text file of the same name, this file is searched for data which can be automatically transferred to the invoice mask. This is, for example, the supplier, which can be determined via the sales tax ID. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchinv" with the name "Incoming invoice" regarding Manual creation of incoming invoices: It is also possible to enter the incoming invoice manually, for example if the incoming invoice document is available in analogue form. In this case, the incoming invoice is entered into ClassiX with the pagination number. ClassiX then automatically checks whether there is a document with the same name in the folder for the scanned incoming invoices. If this is the case, the local document reference is created and linked to the incoming invoice. The document is moved to the "in process" folder. The PDF does not open automatically in this case, as in this case the entry is not made via the PDF. In the case of manual creation of the incoming invoice/credit note, it is not necessary to store the scanned documents in different folders for invoices and credit notes, as the distinction between invoice and credit note is made manually via the capture. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchinv" with the name "Incoming invoice" regarding General information: Only after each of the A/P invoice items has been released can the entire A/P invoice be posted. Access to the incoming invoice modules is prohibited if the purchase orders and the account assignment monitors belong to different clients (domains). This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchinv" with the name "Incoming invoice" regarding List window: Used to list the incoming invoices. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchinv" with the name "Incoming invoice" regarding Selection window: This window is for selecting an A/P invoice. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. How do I define the paths for storing scanned incoming invoices and incoming credit notes in ClassiX?
2. Can I create a subfolder within the "Archive" directory to store incoming invoices based on their year and month?
3. What happens if there is no pagination number with a valid format in the scanned incoming invoice documents? Will the import process still continue?
4. Is it mandatory to associate a locally saved document with every incoming invoice in ClassiX?
5. Can I edit the association between an incoming invoice and its corresponding scanned document later on?
6. Are there any restrictions on accessing the incoming invoice modules if the purchase orders and account assignments belong to different clients (domains)?
7. How do I post an entire AP invoice once all its individual items have been released in ClassiX?
8. Can I view a list of all incoming invoices in ClassiX without having to select a specific client or domain?
9. How do I filter the list of incoming invoices based on specific criteria such as date range, vendor, or amount?
10. Can I export the list of incoming invoices to a CSV or Excel file for further analysis or reporting purposes?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchinv" with the name "Incoming invoice" regarding Implementation: checkMask CalculatePurchaseInvoice Controls the entire calculation of the incoming invoice CalculateSubPositions MarkAllBookingContainers DetailedAccounting CalculateSubPositions Adds all net and gross values (Pos. Totals) of the incoming invoice items. These values serve as the calculation basis (Pos. Totals + Conditions(CalculateSingleCharge)) of the calculated incoming invoice value. MarkAllBookingContainers Initialises the values of the accounting containers. DetailedAccounting CalculateFirstDifferences AccountingRecursive CalculateFirstDifferences_Tax AccountingRecursive_Tax CalculateFirstDifferences Calculates and distributes the cost of the input invoice/item. The result is the vector accounted.amount, which is divided as follows: CX_PURCHASE_INVOICE CX_LINK_TXN GetBaseAccountingValue InitAccountedAmount AccountingRecursive If an incoming invoice is passed to the macro, all items are calculated by calling the macro CalculateFirstDifferences. Subsequently, surcharges and the net difference are distributed to the items before the macro is called up recursively. The accounting containers are then created for the items by calling up the macro AccountTmpPos. CalculateFirstDifferences GetBaseAccountingValue Determines the net value of the incoming invoice (sum of the items)/item (quantity * price). InitAccountedAmount Initialises the vectors which are hidden behind accounted.amount (see CalculateFirstDifferences). The first vector is assigned the return value of the macro GetBaseAccountingValue , all others the value "0". CalculateFirstDifferences_Tax If an incoming invoice item is passed to the macro, this will calculate the tax value (gross-net). The 0th element of the taxed.amount vector is then initialised with this value. The 1st element receives the value "0". Otherwise, if an input invoice object is passed, the taxed value is calculated based on the sums of the net and gross values. The vector is then pre-initialised in the same way. The difference between the calculated and the actual tax value is then written into the second element. AccountingRecursive_Tax CalculateFirstDifferences_Tax CalculateSingleCharge Calculates the net value including the conditions. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchinv" with the name "Incoming invoice" regarding Quality assurance: Messages during account assignment.

I hope these questions cover the key aspects of the "Incoming Invoice" module in SAP!

This is the description of the module "supplierAgreement" with the name "Supplier agreement (AppsWarehouse modules)": Supplier agreements hold suppliers specific data of an order item, such as a negotiated price, a separate order number or order text or the replenishment lead time and order quantity. The main supplier is also maintained in the supplier agreement. The Supplier Agreement shall also specify whether and which parts must be provided to the Supplier when ordering this part of the order. It should be noted here that the logistics code of the part must be changed to "Order part with own provision". This supply agreement must then also be entered in the logistics account in the list of the suppliers providing the parts. See here for more information. Via the list window you can get an overview of existing supplier agreements, for the purpose of electronic exchange you can export and re-import supplier agreements and you can compare the agreed price with the last incoming invoice price. This is the description of the functionality of the module "supplierAgreement" with the name "Supplier agreement (AppsWarehouse modules)" regarding Export/import of supplier agreements: The export and import of supplier agreements serves to update the supplier agreement data. If the supplier announces new prices for his products, it is, for example, easier to export all price agreements made with him to Excel, enter the prices here and then import the data. The Excel table can also be sent directly to the supplier so that he can enter his prices himself. It doesn't matter whether these are simple prices, price tables or prices with discounts/surcharges. Procedure:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "supplierAgreement" with the name "Supplier agreement (AppsWarehouse modules)" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain supplier agreements. You can enter a new price agreement by pressing the Insert button and then selecting a supplier (from the order part) or an order part (from the supplier). You can also drag a supplier into the list of supplier agreements in the ordering section or an order part into the list of supplier agreements of the supplier. To create a supplier agreement from transaction data, simply open it with a double-click and save it in the supplier agreement window. The input window opens and you can now save it to create the supplier agreement. You can then enter the data for the agreement. For an explanation of how to enter a price, it is best to read the documentation on price processing. However, there is one special feature here, namely that you can also enter an absolute surcharge or discount in the conditions of this vendor agreement, which is then transferred as such into the purchase order. In the complex prices themselves, all prices are always calculated per unit of quantity! Here, you can use the order number at the supplier, which is then used, for example, in requirement coverage requests or purchase orders (when converting a requirement coverage request into a purchase order, a possibly changed order number on the requirement coverage request is given preference) or also a purchase order text, which is given preference over the "normal" purchase order text in the ordered article, since this test can differ from supplier to supplier. Instead of an order number, a conditional table can also be created, which points to different order numbers that are dependent on the value of an attribute, for example. If the order text from a supplier agreement has been transferred to a blanket purchase order, it can no longer be changed in the blanket purchase order! If you subsequently want to change this order text here in the supplier agreement, you will receive a warning message that there is an open framework order with a different order text and whether you want to update the order text on the framework order. This is the description of the functionality of the module "supplierAgreement" with the name "Supplier agreement (AppsWarehouse modules)" regarding Evaluation/maintenance of supplier agreements: This window is used to evaluate the supplier agreements, purchase contracts and outline agreements. In addition, the supplier agreements of a supplier can be maintained via Excel (possibly even by the supplier himself) using the export and import function in this window. This is the description of the functionality of the module "supplierAgreement" with the name "Supplier agreement (AppsWarehouse modules)" regarding Maintenance conditional tables: If an order item is a variant part, it is often not possible to specify "simple" values for the supplier number, replenishment lead time, price etc. in the supplier agreement, as various variants can be hidden behind an order item. The solution for this are conditional tables, for example the supplier's own number can be stored depending on the variant. Since it often happens that various details of a supplier agreement are stored in conditional tables, which are structured identically in each case because, for example, a price is associated with each conditional number, the mask "Conditional table maintenance" offers the possibility of synchronous table maintenance. 
Sure, I'd be happy to assist! Based on the provided module description, here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "supplierAgreement" module:

9. How do I use the "conditional tables" feature in the "supplierAgreement" module to manage complex pricing scenarios?
10. Are there any limitations or restrictions on the types of supplier agreements that can be managed within the "supplierAgreement" module?

I hope these questions cover most aspects of the "supplierAgreement" module!

This is the description of the functionality of the module "supplierAgreement" with the name "Supplier agreement (AppsWarehouse modules)" regarding Interface for EDIT_SUPPLIER_AGREEMENT:: Either the supplier agreement(CX_OVERWRITING_REF) is transferred or NULL is used to create a new supplier agreement. The purchase accounts of order part and supplier must be transferred in any case. The monitor is determined from the accounts with Call(DataCubeCore). The monitor is transferred with the messages SUPPLIER_AGREEMENT_CHANGED and SUPPLIER_AGREEMENT_CREATED to update the list. If NULL was transferred on the Stack Top, it is checked whether a supplier agreement already exists for the 2 transferred Purchase Accounts. In the macro CreateObject again Call(DataCubeCore) with TRUE to create the monitor if it does not exist. Then the Purchase Account of the order part is wrapped and a price value per quantity is created. DELETE_SUPPLIER_AGREEMENT: The monitor containing the supplier agreement to be deleted is transferred. If no supplier agreement is found, an error message appears. Then the wrapper of the order part Purchase Account is removed and the message SUPPLIER_AGREEMENT_DELETED is sent with the monitor as transfer parameter. This is the description of the functionality of the module "supplierAgreement" with the name "Supplier agreement (AppsWarehouse modules)" regarding Quality assurance: Description of some test scenarios for the new functionality of the conditional table for the order number. All tests were carried out in EVALUATE with the existing data which were extended as required.

This is the description of the module "autoplst" with the name "Demand and stock list": The demand/inventory list (short: B&B list) offers two modes/options of demand/inventory evaluation: 1. during the date control, requirement coverage documents (planned goods receipts) are analysed with regard to their existence and the replenishment time of the part. Thus, it can be checked whether the stock becomes negative at all or within the respective replenishment time. In such a case, requirement requests for purchased parts or stock orders for production parts can be generated directly from the list. 2. inventory control involves analysing the stocks available today (total stock of a part as of today) and the balance of future movements (balance of all stock reservations, orders, production orders, etc.) This analysis is supported by rules (formulas). These rules include evaluations for e.g. lists of slow-moving items, test runs for parts with negative stock, negative order or production quantity and, of course, balanced minimum stock underruns. This evaluation is available in a time-aggregated form as a requirements/stock overview . The requirements and stock list can also be called up for individual company codes. This is the description of the functionality of the module "autoplst" with the name "Demand and stock list" regarding Schedule control: Mode in which the possible minimum stock underrun is displayed and explained for each part. The corresponding cover documents, which are used to restore the stock level, are also analysed here in relation to the planned dates. Compile a list: a) Mark the field "Date control" (this resets formula windows). b) Make a selection in the Date check field ("strict", "medium" or "soft", see also MRP account) As the planned date ("per date") can also be specified as a time span, this specification determines where these dates can move within the time span. (see QM tests) {img type="fileId" fileId="362" thumb="box" width="100%"} In the case of requirements from part requirements (departure date), the planned date is made up of the earliest and latest start, which also results in a time span. With the evaluation type "Strict", the earliest date of this time span is always used for the evaluation, with the setting "Medium" exactly the middle and with "Soft" the end of the time span, i.e. there is the least buffer for the real demand. If planning (e.g. stock replenishment) is to be carried out with a certain buffer time, the setting "Medium" is recommended, which is also set in this way in the standard system. If there is little space in the warehouse or if the warehouse budget is to be kept as low as possible, the setting "Soft" is recommended, whereby planning is always carried out on the actual demand date. "Strict" thus means that the goods are always procured at the earliest possible date and may also lie in the warehouse for some time until they are needed, depending on how large the buffer times of the requirements were. c) Select stock underruns This indicates which underruns one would like to have listed. You can select underruns of the stock level (Neg.), small minimum stock (Min.), small reorder level (Meld.) and larger maximum stock (Max.). For example, you can ignore negative underruns in order to analyse only the underruns of the minimum and reorder levels. {img type="fileId" fileId="364" thumb="box" width="100%"} When checking the minimum stock level and the reorder level, the current stock plus an order item is taken into account which is in the first position of the planning and is to be delivered within the replenishment lead time. d) Define the underrun type of the above underrun: The first underrun of one of the previously selected underrun types is output immediately or only the "most serious" underrun is returned. The sequence of the check is as follows: less than zero, less than minimum stock, less than reorder point, greater than maximum stock. {img type="fileId" fileId="366" thumb="box" width="100%"} If Selection is set to "First shortfall" and the first thing to do is to fall below the reorder point or fall below it, possible negative stocks are not taken into account. In the other case ("most serious undercut"), on the other hand, this negative stock level and the following cover note are analysed. e) Define period preview (factor replenishment time): An empty field at"replenishment time x" displays all shortfalls of the above selected stocks. If you only want to see the underruns within the "simple" replenishment lead time of the respective part, enter a 1 in this field. For double time enter 2, etc. The basis for the check is always today's date, which is added for the preview with the replenishment lead time multiplied by the factor specified here. Example: f) Select parts (see above). Since the B&B list in the actual sense refers to the availability of the stocked parts, one should also make the appropriate selection here. {img type="fileId" fileId="368" thumb="box" width="100%"} Alternatively, it is also possible to drop parts and structures into the list window and thus start the stock control. When dropping a structure, all parts below the structure node are transferred to the B&B list, no matter in which sublevel they are located. You can select the parts to be ordered in the list and generate a requirement request (stock requirement) with the requirement quantities, which you can then still change ("Enter new requirement request" and "Extend requirement request" buttons). You can also create stock orders for production parts from the list. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. How does the Demand & Stock List feature in the autoplst module allow users to evaluate the demand and inventory status of parts?
2. Can you describe the different modes of demand/inventory evaluation offered by the Demand & Stock List feature?
3. What types of underruns can be analyzed using the Demand & Stock List feature, and how can users select which underruns to display?
4. How does the feature handle negative stock levels, and what options are available for generating requirement requests or stock orders when underruns occur?
5. Can you walk me through the process of selecting parts and defining the period preview for the Demand & Stock List feature?
6. How does the feature accommodate different replenishment lead times for various parts, and what factors can influence the calculation of the replenishment time?
7. Are there any limitations or restrictions on the ability to drop parts and structures into the list window for quick access to the Demand & Stock List feature?
8. Can you provide examples of how the Demand & Stock List feature might be used in practical scenarios, such as managing inventory levels for a manufacturing plant or ensuring timely delivery of essential components?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "autoplst" with the name "Demand and stock list" regarding Stock control: For each part, MRP and stock balances are displayed and the total available quantity is calculated (available quantity today = stock on hand, total available quantity = stock after total MRP = closing balance in the MRP account). Compile a list: a) Select formula via the filter: select one of the requirement formulas defined in the master data(master formulas whose name begins with "DEMAND_") or manually enter any formula expression in the "Formula" field. Then only the parts for which the formula result is "True" (1) will be displayed in the list. When changing the formula later, the quantity of parts to be checked remains the same, i.e. all parts that corresponded to the part search in a previous run are taken into account again. b) Select parts: Press the search button and make a selection; then the stock control is carried out for the parts selected in this way. If parts have already been displayed, the list is deleted first. The selection of parts can be limited as much as possible by using the corresponding window. Alternatively, it is also possible to drop parts and structures into the list window and thus start the stock check. When dropping a structure, all parts below the structure node are transferred to the B&B list, no matter in which sublevel they are located. Calculation of the available quantity: Calculation of the required quantity: You can select the parts to be ordered in the list and generate a requirement request (stock requirement) with the requirement quantities, which you can then still change ("Enter new requirement request" and "Extend requirement request" buttons). You can also create stock orders for production parts from the list. This is the description of the functionality of the module "autoplst" with the name "Demand and stock list" regarding Create purchase orders from the B&B list:: If one or more items are marked in the list and the button "Create new order" is pressed, these marked items will be sorted by the main suppliers of the parts. So the main supplier (A-supplier) of the part is used for the price determination of the parts. If no supplier has been entered for a part, the price defined by default in the order item role is used. For more information on pricing, see here. In the parts list, new columns "U-type/quantity", "U-date/document" and "U-order" are displayed with the following information:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "autoplst" with the name "Demand and stock list" regarding Create requisition from stock/requirements list.: You can generate a requirement coverage request directly from the stock/requirements list by selecting the relevant lines in the list and clicking on 'Create new requirement coverage request'. The window of the last requirement request item opens automatically. In the window 'Requirement request' all marked items are listed. You can add further items from the stock/requirements list via 'Extend requirement coverage request'. Once you have finished your entries, you can decide whether or not the requisition must be approved by ticking the box before approval. With 'Book' the requirement request is forwarded. This is the description of the functionality of the module "autoplst" with the name "Demand and stock list" regarding Purchase parts with own provision: No BA can be generated for purchased parts with internal provision, but a stock order must be created: Since for purchased parts with internal provision some parts - defined in the supplier agreement of the ordered part - must be sent to the supplier for the order, a requirement coverage request cannot simply be created for parts that are marked in the logistics account as "purchased part with internal provision". A purchase order or production order may first have to be created for the parts to be provided. The purchase order is therefore dependent on the parts to be provided. In order to control this logistical process, a stock order must be created for these parts , from which a parts request is then created. The requirement request for the order part is then created from the part request when the parts are released. Attention: In the logistics account of the purchased part with self-supply, it is defined which possible suppliers there are for this provided part. If more than one is selected, the explosion of the parts list is cancelled at the generated stock order. When creating the parts request, a message appears informing you that the supplier from whom the purchased part is to be purchased with in-house provision must be specified on the exploded production parts list. You will find further information on the subject of supplies on the following pages:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "autoplst" with the name "Demand and stock list" regarding Quality assurance: Check B&B list.doc To test the B&B list, you should prepare a part with the desired settings. Using the external dispositions, you can then easily simulate documents that lead to a shortfall in stocks and cover documents and thus check the correct evaluation of the B&B list. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. How do I choose a particular demand formula to display only parts that meet the condition?
2. Can I limit my search to specific parts or structures within the Demand and Stock List?
3. What happens if I modify the formula later; how does it affect the previously selected parts?
4. How can I create a purchase order from the B&B list, and what factors influence the price determination?
5. Can I extend the requirement request with additional items from the stock/requisites list?
6. How can I tell if a part requires internal provision, and what are the implications for purchasing and inventory management?
7. Is it possible to simulate documents leading to stock shortages and verify the accuracy of the B&B list through external dispositions?
8. Can I view additional columns such as U-type/quantity," U-date/document," and "U-order" in the parts list?
9. How can I generate a requirement coverage request directly from the stock/requires list, and what information is included in the requirement request window?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "autoplst" with the name "Demand and stock list" regarding Scenario 1: Replacement time x: "" -> All documents are taken into account. The cover document is classified as "too late". 1 -> All receipts within the replenishment lead time are taken into account. Thus only the demand on 2.8. is reported. The cover document is also not displayed. 2 -> All documents are taken into account. The cover document is classified as "too late". Return priority: First -> Regardless of the replenishment time, the shortfall of the reorder point on 2.8. is always displayed. Schl.-> If the period of the replenishment lead time is considered, the shortfall of the reorder level is displayed. For all other periods ("", replenishment lead time * 2, 3, ) the negative stock is reported. This is the description of the functionality of the module "autoplst" with the name "Demand and stock list" regarding Scenario 2: Select type of analysis: Strict -> If the analysis type is set to "strict", the latest possible date for cover documents of the cover document is always selected, i.e. 1.8. Thus, we run into the negative on withdrawal and the cover is classified as too late. Soft -> The earliest possible date for cover documents is always selected. Thus, part is not displayed in the B&B list, as there is no stock shortfall. Info: For documents that reduce the stock, the date is set exactly the other way round. Thus, for the setting "soft", the end of the period is always assumed and the beginning for the setting "strict". This is the description of the functionality of the module "autoplst" with the name "Demand and stock list" regarding Scenario 3: (WEEinkauf 29) Type of analysis: Strict -> Monday is assumed for the requirements document.

This is the description of the module "budofedt" with the name "Budget Offer": This module primarily supports the sales/field service in preparing so-called budget offers (short offers). The normal quotation module is designed to record a quotation both commercially (sales prices, conditions) and technically (article incl. characteristics) in detail and exactly. A sales representative usually does not have this option, as he may have limited access to the ClassiX® ERP system. In order to support the sales representative in preparing and submitting offers, this module can be used together with an offline solution of the ClassiX® system. The aim is that the field service enters the budget offers via the offline solution and transfers them to the main database at the next online access. (In addition to the offline solution, it is also planned to record the budget offers via a web interface). The sales representative benefits from the use of the budget offers by accessing various master information (standard sales articles/ sets, sales conditions) and a uniform and automated output of the offer (forms). Due to the import of the budget quotations into the main database, the head office benefits from a lower follow-up effort of the quotations/orders and a better, more uniform overview of the quotations submitted by the field service.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "saleitem" with the name "Articles for sale" regarding Specification numbers for sales items: The sales article role of a variant part describes the article in its various variants from a sales perspective. The article is specified here by defining the attributes when it is used, for example in the order item. However, if standard variants are also sold, they can be assigned their own number without having to create the variant part in sub-parts with their own sales roles. This number is called specification or specification number. If a sales item, which has predefined specifications, is inserted, for example in an order, you can still go via the sales item number and individually define the attributes in the item. However, the specifications also make it possible to search for and insert the item via the specification number in the sales item selection mask. The advantage of this is that the attribute value hidden behind the specification is automatically transferred to the item. The specification number table can be generated automatically from the price table or the table of subparts. If the route via the subparts list is chosen, the number of the subparts is also immediately adopted as the number of the specification. (However, the numbers of the specification are of course freely selectable).

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_abschluss01" with the name "Monthly statement" regarding Close statistics period: In order to achieve a defined delimitation of a business period, it is advisable to open it specifically - usually by Controlling - for the users at the beginning of the period (i.e. to make a business period available as a selection when processing a document, e.g. an invoice) and to close it again at the end (not to allow the selection of the closed business period any more). This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_abschluss01" with the name "Monthly statement" regarding Check and correct suppressed errors: Before you carry out the valuation of the stock, the unfinished products or the final costing, you must have checked and corrected the suppressed errors. These are erroneous documents that are not or only partially taken into account in the valuations. Possible errors that are displayed : The suppressed errors of individual database operations can be checked and corrected in the module "suppressed errors". You can open the module in the menu "Services/Insections". This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_abschluss01" with the name "Monthly statement" regarding Inventory valuation: The month-end closing of the warehouse statistics is the prerequisite for a secure valuation of the stock. All movement data of parts and their storage locations are evaluated and added together, average prices, start, dispatch, receipt and end values are determined. Finally, the value of the warehouse can be read off from these end values for each desired period. However, a few things have to be taken into account for an error-free determination of the bearing value: These plausibility checks are part of the functionality of the warehouse statistics. If parts or warehouses have been selected in the selection mask and the corresponding time period has been set, it is possible to start specific automatic test runs. The results of such test runs - more or less relevant for an evaluation - are displayed in the results window integrated in the warehouse statistics. This results window directly offers the possibility to correct some of the displayed errors and to redetermine the evaluation. If the displayed errors for a part/storage bin have not been completely corrected, the month-end closing for this part/storage bin is not completely possible, which is indicated by a "red dot" in the respective line of the stock statistics. Errors such as movements without price/value are generally caused by missing information in the parts master: if, for example, an order part lacks the order roll or no standard price is entered on the order roll, a goods withdrawal cannot be valuated, but the system does allow it - to avoid malfunctions. In order to find such parts, the inspection module of the materials management system includes corresponding test runs. Further inspection runs are: IMPORTANT! The storage statistics must be completed. This is the only way to ensure that all parts to be evaluated are included in the warehouse statistics. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_abschluss01" with the name "Monthly statement" regarding Valuation of work in progress and post-calculation: The order cost evaluation can be used to create the final costing for current or completed orders and the valuation of unfinished products.

The pick to be made is automatically assigned to the warehouse employee. He has the choice of specifying a picking list (picking list selection via picking licence) or simply selecting the next pending pick without taking a picking list into account (automatic picking list selection). When parking, the warehouse employee is shown whether the goods need to be consolidated (e.g. because goods from other picking zones still need to be picked for this picking list) and whether goods from this picking list are already picked in another storage bin. The warehouse employee tries to place the goods in the same storage bin where goods from this picking list are already stored. This is similar to the storage of goods at PickAndCollect. The strategies for filing are defined customer-specifically in each case.

The employee is automatically assigned the top entry from the queue for the pick zone in which he is logged in. After the pick has been processed, the system automatically checks whether there are other corresponding picks in the queue. If so, the employee is immediately assigned the next pick. Remarks: The choice of the storage location is free. However, the employee is shown whether the picked goods must be consolidated and in which storage bins there are already picked goods for this sales order. This display helps the employee to find a suitable storage location.

This is the description of the module "cxStockSpace" with the name "Storage area": Storage bins are objects of the type "account" (CX_STOCK_SPACE) and have the task of managing stock quantities of parts in a warehouse or storage aids. Other business objects can also hold an account of the type "storage bin", e.g. forklift trucks for the short-term storage of goods. It is not possible to make a stock entry (entry, removal, transfer) without having defined at least one warehouse with at least one storage bin beforehand. A warehouse can have any number of storage bins, a storage bin is always assigned to only one warehouse. Storage bins typically have a bin "number" which is or should be exactly the same as the identification of a particular storage bin in the physical warehouse. In addition to information on location, size and capacity calculation, storage bins can be assigned to various sort keys, for example, to assign the storage bin to a storage type, storage section, picking area, staging area, door, or transfer zone, etc. Once the evaluation groups have been assigned, characteristics can be added to them in order to optimally control the warehouse management. In the standard system, the term "picking zone" (also often referred to as storage area) is predefined as a classification term for a storage bin with identifier "PICKING_ZONE". Sub-terms for freely definable picking areas are: Fast-moving items, Slow-moving items, etc.The term "perpetual inventory" is also predefined in the standard system as a classification term with the identifier "CONTINOUS_STOCKTAKING". Within this order structure, the storage bins are divided into individual subgroups for which inventories are then carried out one after the other in the course of a year. In this way, an inventory plan is defined for all storage bins, which ensures that each storage bin is counted at least once within a business year. The warehouse assigned to a storage bin can also be assigned to sort keys (see sort key "STORAGE_TYPE" for storage types), it is up to the internal organisation to find an optimal structure of the data for the company. Storage locations can be assigned to a topography of a warehouse in order to optimise paths in the warehouse. It is recommended that the storage locations are specified for aisle/rack/compartment (see utility Split storage location numbers into aisle/rack/compartment, which can be called up from the menu of the list window) and their X, Y and Z coordinates are set (see utility Import X, Y and Z coordinates of storage locations, which can be called up from the menu of the list window).

In the upper part of the display you can see the dispositive stock on the left and the total stock of the part on the right. The dispositive stock of a part is the stock which is stored in warehouses with stock disposition. It can be reserved for future requirements. The total stock also includes the parts that are available, for example, for employees in manual vehicle warehouses, but which cannot be reserved for order requirements. The manual warehouses are not managed in stock, but have an imputed stock for valuation purposes that is determined by an inventory. If warehouses are assigned to company codes and parts have been posted to warehouses assigned in this way, the stocks in the selected company codes can be displayed. In the respective listings, the stocks in the individual storage bins where the parts are stored are displayed. If at some point a part is posted to a storage bin, a separate line for this storage bin is created in this display. The stock can also be called up via a storage location in order to see which parts are stored here and in what quantities.

This is the description of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography": Especially for the purpose of path optimisation in a high bay warehouse (or other storage locations), access nodes (CX_ACCESS_NODE) and weighted access paths(CX_ACCESS_WAY) between access nodes are maintained in this module.To set up a topography for a bearing, the following procedure is recommended:Assign storage locations to newly created access nodesCreate warehouse topographyWeighting of access routes Check node/path graph Once the topography has been set up, the optimal route between two access nodes or between several access nodes can be displayed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain access nodes (of e.g. storage bins) and the access routes between these access nodes. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding List window: This window is used to list and edit the saved access nodes. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select access nodes. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Option window: All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed with the "OK" button. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Assign storage locations to newly created access nodes: In this window you can specify the settings to assign access nodes to storage bins, i.e. one or more storage bins together receive a newly created access node object. If none of the three possible options is made (across compartments or shelves or the same X, Y coordinates), then each of the previously selected storage bins receives its own access node object. Currently, only one of the three options can be selected in the standard system. In the newly created access node objects, the X, Y and Z coordinates of the storage bins are transferred; if these are not available, the coordinates from the specifications for aisle, shelf and compartment are transferred. If the selected storage bins have already been assigned to access nodes, processing is cancelled. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Create warehouse topography: In this window, you can specify the settings to create a topography of the storage bins, i.e. the access node objects of the storage bins are connected to each other via access route objects, which are also weighted among each other depending on the distance and direction of the access nodes. If access routes have already been assigned to the selected access nodes, processing is aborted. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Weighting of access routes: In this window you can enter weights to enter the weight of new access routes or to recalculate the total weight of existing access routes. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Check node/path graph: This window shows how many other access nodes can be reached from the access node shown in the list. The number displayed at each access node should be the same as the number of access nodes of a warehouse displayed/selected in the list (see field "Number / Selected" at the bottom right of the window), if the graph is fully developed (i.e. all access nodes are "somehow" connected via CX_ACCESS_WAY objects). If this number is lower, an error or missing connections in the graph must be assumed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Optimal route between two access nodes: After entering a start and a destination access node, you can display the nodes that lie on the optimal route between the two access nodes. The focus of this application is to check the route between two access nodes which the system calculates as optimal. By changing the weights of the access routes between access nodes, you can influence the optimal route. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessNode" with the name "Topography" regarding Optimal route between several access nodes: This application calculates the optimal route from a starting point, across several access nodes to an end point. Start and end point can also be the same for a "round trip". This scenario thus represents the "Travelling salesman problem" (TSP), which can no longer be calculated in a reasonable time if the number of access nodes entered is too large (already from about 6 nodes). (The optimal way of "faculty of the number of list entries" possible ways has to be found: see GetNodePermutations).
Sure! Here are some realistic questions based on the provided module description:

1. How do I assign storage locations to newly created access nodes in the cxAccessNode module?
2. Can I create a warehouse topography in the cxAccessNode module without assigning storage locations to access nodes?
3. How do I weight access routes in the cxAccessNode module to optimize the path between two access nodes?
4. Is it possible to display the optimal route between multiple access nodes in the cxAccessNode module?
5. Can I use the cxAccessNode module to calculate the optimal route for a round trip between multiple access nodes?
6. What happens if I select multiple storage bins to assign to an access node in the cxAccessNode module?
7. Does the cxAccessNode module allow me to change the X, Y, and Z coordinates of storage bins after they have been assigned to access nodes?
8. Can I view the number of access nodes that can be reached from a given access node in the cxAccessNode module?
9. How does the weighting of access routes affect the optimal route calculation in the cxAccessNode module?
10. Are there any limitations to the number of access nodes that can be included in a single topography in the cxAccessNode module?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "payments" with the name "Payments" regarding Financial accounting:: You can create your payment proposal list using the selection criteria available here. You can enter individual or several criteria. Your payments to employees, for example for travel expense accounts, can also be made from here. You can also use the selection fields to include vendors with customer accounts in the list, initiate a new list structure and include or exclude invoices with an entered payment block. The payment proposal list is then displayed for further processing with the 'Lists' button. In the payment proposal list, you can mark the entries manually, by mouse click, or via the menu item 'Select' - 'Conditional selection'. With 'Conditional selection' you can select the amount and with 'Select all' you can select all entries. With the menu item 'Delete selection' you can revise the selection made. You can then use the menu item Edit to remove the ORs you have selected from the payment proposal list. You can also remove blocked ORs if you have not yet done so in the preselection or if you have reprocessed ORs from the list. You can also add other operations to the list. You can either do that: via 'drag and drop' from the individual surgery lists, the journal or the surgery administration, or: via the menu item 'Other payment proposals'. If you want to add further payment proposals to the existing ones via the selection window again, please make sure that you do not leave the 'New structure' field in the selection window ticked, otherwise you would generate the list from scratch. Selected payment proposals can also be individually post-processed by double-clicking. The 'Fixed payment dates' click box allows you to set the due dates independently of the other dates. An internal comment can also be added to the open item in the 'Text' field. You can still lock or unlock the surgery using the 'Number lock' field. If you need more detailed information on individual ORs or even need to rework them, you can select the OR in question and then use the icons to go directly to the corresponding supplier or employee, vendor or employee account, OR management or journal entry. Of course, details such as a payment block in the OR can be changed directly there and are then immediately effective. If required, the total of the payment proposals can be displayed on the screen or the entire payment proposal list can be printed. This applies both to the selected entries and to all entries in the payment proposal list. After the payment proposal list has been completely processed, the payments are posted via the menu item 'Payment', under the respective payment type, with 'Book'. You will have to mark the payment proposals again for posting. In this way, you can choose different payment types for the payment proposals selected. The payment proposals then processed are then automatically removed from the list. If all payments are to be made via one bank or payment method, you can of course also select all payment proposals at once. Remember that an interim account must also be created for the selected bank. If the bank disk is to be created at the same time, the path must be specified in the 'File' field. If this path refers directly to the floppy disk drive, then the floppy disk must also be inserted. The processing of the payment run is then started by clicking on the 'Update' button and is completed with the printing of the accompanying slip in the case of diskette clearing. The remittance slip printing and cheque printing are carried out in the same way as diskette clearing. To ensure that the forms are correctly clamped in the printer, a test print can first be made there. The paid OPs are automatically cleared only after a successful disk clearing or after printing the remittance slip or cheques. Until then, the invoices and the offset payments remain in the open items. A possible cause for errors can be a missing bank connection in the supplier master data. If this is the case, enter them accordingly and then repeat the diskette clearing or the bank transfer or cheque printing. The diskette clearing as well as the printing of transfers or cheques can be repeated as often as required. This is also possible via the menu item 'Activities'-'Financial accounting'-'Payments' of the main menu. To do this, enter the document number of the payment run to be repeated and the corresponding period. In the repeat run, you have the option of subsequently excluding payments by selection. However, since the payments are already booked at that time, this should only be done in exceptional cases. You will therefore need special access rights to this function and must subsequently remember to update the excluded payments in your accounts accordingly. The payment selection for employees is done in the same way. Here the restriction via a cost centre is also available for selection.

Note that these questions are designed to elicit information solely from the provided module description, without asking for external knowledge or assumptions. Additionally, I've tried to vary the verb tenses and sentence structures to avoid repetition and improve readability.

This is the description of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler": The object web crawler runs through the database and automatically creates data connectors for the objects found. The data connectors then receive data fields matching the objects, so that in the end the data fields of a data connector represent the superset of the used slots and members of all objects of this data connector. A detailed description of the crawler's logic can be found in the technical documentation. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding Input window: This window is used to configure and start the crawler. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding Implementation: The object web crawler searches the database for objects and creates data connectors to the found objects and books the slots and members of the objects as data fields in the data connectors. The crawler always starts with the objects of the Root-Entry-Point Collections (REP) and follows all references to other objects starting from these objects. The crawler starts with the objects that were in the queue when it was started. All objects found from them are added to the queue and processed object by object. As soon as the queue is empty, the objects of all REPs with the REP start index are added to the queue and the processing of the queue starts again. After the queue is processed again, the REP start index is incremented and the process starts again until the highest index of the largest REP is reached. Since all objects for a REP start index must always be processed first and already processed objects are ignored, the effect occurs that the processing of the first REP index takes a very long time and the remaining indexes are then processed very quickly. This effect can be significantly mitigated by deselecting the option REP objects in queue. The basic procedure of the crawler is thus outlined. However, there are some additional rules and special cases, which will be considered separately in the following subsections. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding Main and auxiliary data connectors: Not all objects are equally interesting for reports and evaluations. There are certain objects that you can search for and over which you would run evaluations, so-called main objects. Other objects can only be reached via these main objects and are never considered separately. The main criterion for a main object is that it is in a REP. Furthermore, objects of the classes on the whitelist are also main objects. Objects on the blacklist are of course not main objects even if they are in a REP. For main objects data connectors are created in the REP of the data connectors. These data connectors are then also called main data connectors. For auxiliary objects, data connectors are created hierarchically below the main data connectors, which are then not stored in the REP of the data connectors. These auxiliary data connectors are therefore only accessible via the main data connectors, just as the corresponding objects can only be accessed via the main objects. It is possible that a certain class appears both as main and auxiliary data connector. This state occurs when the objects of the class are stored in the REP by default, but individual objects are deliberately not registered in the REP. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding Black- and Whitelist: The algorithm for determining the main and auxiliary data connectors needs fine tuning for some types. On the one hand there are classes for which no data connector at all should be created, on the other hand some objects should be considered as main objects although they are not in any REP. For these adjustments there are the blacklist and the whitelist. On the black- and whitelist there are classes. All objects that belong to these classes or to classes derived from them are considered to belong to the corresponding list. The blacklist describes objects for which no data connector is to be created. If a reference to such an object is posted as a data field, only the referenced type is set, but no data connector is created. The blacklist contains the following classes: The whitelist describes objects for which a main data connector should be created even if they are not in any REP. The whitelist contains the following classes:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding Finding the right main object: Due to the way the crawler works, that it simply runs through all links to other objects from the objects of the REPs, the path it has taken to an object is not necessarily the shortest or semantically correct one. Therefore, for each auxiliary object the matching main object and the path between both must be searched for. For this purpose, all slots and members are assigned costs. The costs are designed to be lower if the path is potentially semantically ascending in the model. The costs are listed in the following table. On the one hand the costs for the path taken by the crawler and on the other hand the costs to all accessible main objects are calculated. The path with the lowest costs and the corresponding main object are then assumed to be correct. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. How do I specify which objects to prioritize during the crawling process?
2. Can I customize the cost assignment for different slot and member combinations?
3. What happens if an object is part of multiple REPs; how does the crawler handle such situations?
4. Can I exclude certain classes from being considered as main objects?
5. How does the crawler determine the shortest or semantically correct path to a main object?
6. Are there any limitations on the number of data connectors that can be created for a single object?
7. Can I modify the whitelist and blacklist settings after the crawler has been initialized?
8. How does the crawler handle circular references within the object graph?
9. Can I schedule the crawler to run at a specific time or interval?
10. Are there any logging features available to monitor the progress and performance of the crawler?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding Wrapper: No data connectors are created for wrappers themselves. Instead, data fields are created as if they were directly referenced to the wrapped objects. In addition, data fields are created for the members and slots of the wrapper with the prefix of the actual member or slot. So you can see later which slots have been added or overwritten by a wrapper. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding Attribute Tables: No data connector is created for attribute tables. Instead, the attributes contained in the table are posted directly as data fields with the prefix of the member or slot. Thus, one can see directly in the data connector which attributes are contained in the referenced table. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding Accounts: For accounts that appear in a REP, a main data connector is normally created. For all other accounts no data connector is created. Instead, the members and slots of the account are posted directly in the data connector as data fields with the prefix of the referring member or slot. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding Post-processing: As soon as the actual crawling process has been completed, the data connectors are post-processed. This post-processing can also be called up manually via the menu and includes the steps specified in the following subsections. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding Creating partial access paths for long access paths: If an access path contains several steps, a separate data field is created for each of these steps if it does not already exist. It is tried to determine the type of the data field, the type of the referenced object and the name automatically using the information from DDI or slots. If this information does not exist, the access path to the objects of the data connector is evaluated and an attempt is made to determine the information about them. Furthermore, referenced main data connectors are automatically linked to the new data field. If no name has been found for the data field so far, the name of the data connector is used for the data field. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding Calculation of the distance of a data field: For each data field, the length of the access expression is stored in the associated.counter slot. This length describes the number of steps in the access expression. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding Create a data field CX_KLASSE::this for each data connector: For each data connector a data field is created with the access expression CX_KLASSE::this, which refers to the data connector itself. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding Performance Optimization: Each database and each requirement for the crawler is different, so it is not possible to specify a unique best set of parameters for all databases. At this point, however, we will describe the parameters that mainly affect performance. The parameters usually result in fewer objects being examined, but they should still reflect the overall picture. However, it should be clear that a reduction in the number of objects examined will potentially make the crawling result less accurate. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding Recursion depth: The recursion depth indicates how far away an object is from a REP object, i.e. how many references must be run to get to this object. If there are more steps than the recursion depth, the object is not processed. A high recursion depth results in heavily nested data connectors. If a lot of nested data is used, for example subitems of subitems in orders, the recursion depth must be set higher. A value of -1 disables the recursion depth check. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding Maximum collection depth: The maximum collection depth specifies the maximum number of objects in a collection to be examined. If there are always similar objects in a collection, a high collection depth reduces the performance drastically without a gain in knowledge. However, if there are always different objects in collections and they are not all examined, some characteristics are not posted as data connectors. In this case the value can and should be set lower the more similar objects within the same collection are. A value of 0 ensures that all objects in a collection are always considered. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding Transaction splitting: The transaction splitting specifies after how many examined objects the current transaction should be completed and a new one started. The completion of the transaction ensures on the one hand that intermediate states are permanently stored in the database and on the other hand prevents the effect that the system slows down with too many changes within a transaction. However, closing transactions too often also slows down the system. The statistics are always updated when the transaction is completed. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. How do I create data fields for members and slots of a wrapper in Object Web Crawler?

10. Are there any limitations or restrictions on the usage of data connectors and data fields in Object Web Crawler, and if so, what are they?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "objectWebCrawler" with the name "Object Web Crawler" regarding REP objects in queue: This option controls whether REP objects reached during crawling should be queued or not. If REP objects are inserted into the queue, the effect is that almost all objects of the first REP index are reached and the processing of the first index takes a long time and the other indexes can be processed quickly because most of the objects have already been analysed. But this also causes the queue to become very large and therefore slow. If the option is deselected, the work is better distributed over the REP indices and the queue does not grow very large. If the whole database is run through anyway, selecting or deselecting the option does not affect the result, since all objects of the REPs are run through anyway. However, if only a single REP index is run through or only single objects are examined, unchecking the option would mean that reached REP objects are not examined. The recommendation is therefore to deselect the option if the whole database is searched and to select it if only a part of the database is to be searched.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "Object Web Crawler" module based on its description:

1. What is the purpose of the "Queue REP objects" option in the Object Web Crawler module?

5. Is there a limit to the number of REP objects that can be queued at one time?
6. How does the size of the queue impact the performance of the crawler?
7. Are there any scenarios where it would be beneficial to select the "Queue REP objects" option, even if the whole database is being searched?
8. Can you provide examples of how the "Queue REP objects" option could be used in different use cases?
9. Does the "Queue REP objects" option affect the order in which REP objects are processed by the crawler?
10. Can the "Queue REP objects" option be disabled altogether if desired?

This is the description of the module "warehouseMonitor" with the name "stock monitor": From the warehouse monitor, all inbound and outbound business processes (goods receipt, goods issue and goods transport), the resources available in a warehouse (parts, storage aids) and all material movements with their warehouse execution documents are controlled and monitored. The order of the tabs should also underline the processing of material movements in a warehouse. This is the description of the functionality of the module "warehouseMonitor" with the name "stock monitor" regarding Outgoing goods: In the outbound business process of the goods issue, pick lists are released, allocations are executed and released and the status of picking, consolidation, packing and wrapping in the warehouse is monitored. This is the description of the functionality of the module "warehouseMonitor" with the name "stock monitor" regarding Picklists: Picklists form the interface between order processing and the warehouse. Pick lists are created from the order processing and are therefore the trigger for the merchandise management system to pick, pack and dispatch the goods. In this window you can list the picking list items which have not yet been released or which have already been released.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocservice" with the name "Business processes - Service" regarding Recording: {img fileId="259" thumb="box" width="100%"}{img fileId="261" thumb="box" width="100%"} The service call can be used to record both services to be performed(external trigger) and installation and commissioning(internal trigger). The externally triggered service call is primarily used to record the service request, the error message or the problem of the operator (customer). In addition, the assignment to the operator and the industrial plant is set. In the case of internally triggered service calls, the service to be provided is defined by the order processing department (new plants, conversions) to the service department. The assignment to the plant and the customer is made by the predecessor of the order. In addition, the value for internal cost allocation is defined via the service call. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocservice" with the name "Business processes - Service" regarding Scheduling: {img fileId="261" thumb="box" width="100%"}{img fileId="265" thumb="box" width="100%"} From the service call, the service can now create service call items for scheduling service calls. To do this, the service to be performed is described for each item, an employee is determined who is to perform the work and the planned date is defined with a planned working time. ClassiX® supports the service by an automatic capacity planning, which can be carried out via the service call. Every service employee receives his assignments and tasks via the service call. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocservice" with the name "Business processes - Service" regarding Implementation: {img fileId="263" thumb="box" width="100%"} Each service call position has its own number and is also valid for the service technician as a work certificate/service provider group, via which the service technician then reports back on the services he has performed (travel, installation, maintenance) and the spare parts he has used. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocservice" with the name "Business processes - Service" regarding Settlement: {img fileId="253" thumb="box" width="100%"} In the case of internally triggered service calls, the costs are now allocated internally between the triggered and executed cost centre via a cost service posting. {img fileId="255" thumb="box" width="100%"}{img fileId="257" thumb="box" width="100%"} For externally triggered service calls, it is now defined whether the service call can be invoiced to the customer or not. In the case of invoicing, the work certificate is transferred to an invoice. If the costs are borne by the customer (warranty), the work certificate is cancelled and automatically converted into an assembly certificate. This is then posted in the financial accounting. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocservice" with the name "Business processes - Service" regarding General overview: {img type="fileId" fileId="251" thumb="box" width="100%"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocservice" with the name "Business processes - Service" regarding Spare parts enquiries: In addition to the service requests (service calls), spare parts requests(enquiries) are the second pillar for the inclusion of service requests. This document is used to document customer enquiries and is the starting point for further processing. Enquiries, if they were triggered externally, can refer to an industrial plant, a cost object or a sales order. Enquiries can be nested as deeply as desired, i.e. they can be grouped into topics or enquiry nodes, which are themselves assigned to higher-level topics or enquiry nodes. This is particularly useful when different partners (employees of the same company or third parties working on the same plant) request an enquiry on the same case. Enquiries can be used to identify this so that no different offers are made for the same incident. Enquiries are subject to a workflow that enables them to be processed by different commercial and technical team members. For example, it is conceivable that the technical processing department researches and specifies the required spare parts, while the commercial processing department is responsible for the further preparation of offers and order processing. The spare parts can be assigned directly to the enquiry, so that quotations and orders can be generated automatically. An advantage of the enquiry is that each enquiry gets a unique number (ticket number), which channels the communication with the customer and supplier (regarding technical queries). In addition, pre-fabricated emails (confirmation of receipt, queries, etc.) can be generated using stored forms. Business transactions are documented via the document history. Incoming emails can be linked to the request as document references, giving every employee access to the communication objects involved. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocservice" with the name "Business processes - Service" regarding Maintenance invoices: Maintenance invoices are used for the automatic, periodic invoicing of maintenance flat rates, without the need to provide a service in addition to the "provision" of the maintenance in the agreed period. Maintenance flat rates are defined via an order or an order item which contains the condition category "Recurring payment". Maintenance invoices are automatically generated via the module "Accounting of due recurring payments". This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocservice" with the name "Business processes - Service" regarding Maintenance contracts: Maintenance contracts are used to automatically create periodic service and maintenance orders. Here, too, the condition "Recurring payment" serves to define the interval at which maintenance is to be carried out cyclically. The "Due Maintenance Contracts" module is used to determine the service and maintenance contracts due and to generate the service/maintenance orders from these. The service/maintenance contract ideally defines the agreed services via service provider groups. These enable the service technicians to be scheduled directly. However, maintenance contracts do not have to be invoiced. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocservice" with the name "Business processes - Service" regarding Breach of contract: Problems in the contractual relationship can be recorded and documented in the event of contractual faults. In the event of possible legal action, the disruptions can thus be fully traced.

This is the description of the module "workTimeFlexiCalculate" with the name "Flexitime accounting": The data for flexitime accounting is recorded at time recording terminals. These create a text file for each day, which must be read in daily via the function "Activities - Personnel - Daily - Read in terminal bookings".This is the so-called daily closing. Once this has been done, the current day can be evaluated.The flexitime rules and working hours assigned to employees or their cost centre are used to evaluate their flexitime.From these and the clock-in and clock-out data recorded by stamping at the terminal, it is now determined whether the employee has worked exactly in the prescribed time and duration. In order to define messages about irregularities or rules for the summation of attendance times, the flexitime rules must be used. They specify whether a message should appear if the employee has already clocked in before his or her actual working time, or whether the breaks are added up or added to the working time. This is the description of the functionality of the module "workTimeFlexiCalculate" with the name "Flexitime accounting" regarding Functionality: This window is used for flexitime accounting.

This is the description of the module "formula" with the name "Calculation formula - Rules": Calculation rules, which do not exist as part of a program but as data generated and managed by the user, are represented in the ClassiX® system by objects of class CX_FORMULA. general overview Variable of a formula Constants Operators, arithmetic functions special functions within a formula expression InstantView® and class CX_FORMULA Examples Before a formula can be calculated, values must be assigned to the variables occurring in the formula. This is done automatically with the objects previously registered in the PlugSpace. The variables occurring in a formula can themselves represent a formula or a condition table (object CX_CONDITIONED_BAG). The formula object can determine which variables it needs for the calculation (also in case of a formula in the formula etc.). The module Test Formula constructs a window for the input of variable values. For this purpose an object of the class CX_CONTAINER is used - an object whose only function is to hold any dynamic data fields. The result of a formula calculation can be a value - in case of an arithmetic expression - or TRUE/FALSE as the result of a logical expression. A formula ending with ; will not return a value. Attention: - The formula only calculates when the formula is ended / completed. - Value assignments to external variables are only executed when the formula is ended. This is the description of the functionality of the module "formula" with the name "Calculation formula - Rules" regarding Special features for use in conditional tables: Attention: If a variable definition (local a;) is present in the condition for conditional tables, no column may be inserted in the table, since the columns are evaluated before the rest of the condition and thus a separation by a semicolon would occur in the middle of the condition! In this case the following message is displayed when leaving the line: Operand expected! Attention: If columns are defined in a conditional table and the additional condition contains an OR link, then the entire additional condition must be placed in brackets, otherwise the preceding condition columns are ignored if the OR area is true! Example: (rF="right rising"|rF="left falling"). This is the description of the functionality of the module "formula" with the name "Calculation formula - Rules" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain calculation formulas. You can select a calculation formula by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". Via the menu item 'Basic data - Calculation formulas' you reach the corresponding search window, in which all current calculation formulas are displayed. Double-clicking on one of the entries opens the 'Calculation formula' window and you can edit the entry. With OK you save the changes. With 'New' it is possible to create a new formula. Enter a consecutive number or a term in the field 'No.' and select a meaningful name for the field 'Name'. In the field 'Formula' you can now enter a formula that the system should convert. You can then use the 'Edit - Test formula' item to test whether the formula is implemented correctly. With OK you save your entries.

This is the description of the module "localeEdit" with the name "Location data": Important! Please also read the description on the subject of location-specific data in the installation documentation This module is used to create, maintain and manage location-specific data. These can represent and explain federal states, provinces and any deeply nested regions. When a user logs on to the system, the system checks whether a separate company calendar (locale) exists at the employing company (place of employment of the employee). If so, this locale calendar is logged on, otherwise it is checked whether the locale has one and so on up to the top locale. If no company calendar was found in this way, the system checks whether there is a locale at the client company and registers it. If no locale is linked here either, the locale specified in the batch file via the environment variables for country, state and region is registered. As the ClassiX® system knows the connections between different localities, for example the superordinate country of any state or region, the following possibilities arise: Generally speaking, a country's characteristics are handed down to a federal state and then to subordinate regions. However, some of this information can be overwritten by directly changing a certain property in a subordinate locality, for example a federal state. Now this new property applies to this subordinate locality and all its subordinate localities, for example regions. Of course you can also change the same property in some of the subordinate localities, for example in regions. However, a region can also pass on properties to a federal state and this to the higher-level state. This is the special case where a superior locality has at least all time zones of its subordinate localities. Of course, the time zones of the superior locality can be extended, but not restricted. This is another reason why you need to be sure where you are making settings. That is why the characteristics of a locality are divided into informative characteristics of the superior country, characteristics to be set in the superior country and characteristics to be set in this locality: Informative characteristics of a country are: - Country name - Country code - Number plate - Winter/summer time or summer/winter time changeover These properties are taken from internal tables and cannot be changed by the user to ensure consistency with reality. These informative properties are valid for the country and all its subordinate localities. The characteristics of a country to be set are: - National currency - International area code - Number format - Date and time These characteristics are from a superior country, not from a subordinate locality, and must therefore be changed at the state level. These properties to be set are valid for the country and all its subordinate localities. The properties of a locality to be set are: - Place name - Language - System number of the language - Time zone or start and end time zone (regions have only one time zone) - Working days - Telecommunications - Holidays and holidays These properties are specific to a particular location and can therefore be set at all levels. If these properties are only set at state level, they are also valid for all subordinate localities. However, as mentioned above, these can be changed at a subordinate local level. These changes are valid for the edited locality and all its subordinate localities. Telecommunication is an exception, as these settings are only valid for your own locality, neither taken from above nor transferred to below. A special case of informative features are the federal state and region codes. These are automatically assigned by the ClassiX® system when the corresponding localities are created and can be used in combination with the state codes to set the environment variables in the project-specific batch file. You can read more about this in the description of location-specific data in the installation documentation. Attention! If you make changes to the location that is currently set as the system location, you must first activate it by setting this location as the system location again. This is the description of the functionality of the module "localeEdit" with the name "Location data" regarding Input window: Fields. This is the description of the functionality of the module "localeEdit" with the name "Location data" regarding Operations calendar: In addition to the calendar for financial years in financial, fixed asset and cost accounting, as well as the personnel calendar for recording and maintaining absences (holidays, sick days) and working with flexitime, a company's non-working days are maintained in the company calendar. In this window, the previously entered operating calendar valid for the registered company or the registered user can be viewed and supplemented. As a rule, maintenance of the company calendar is the responsibility of the management. The entries added by an employee can be changed (double-click on list entry) or deleted. In the list, the added entries are additionally displayed in red font colour, so you can easily see which holidays are not directly location-specific, but really represent the company calendar and can be edited or deleted.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "localeEdit" with the name "Location data" regarding Operating calendar entry window: This editing mask is used to enter or change user-defined operating calendar entries. The entry can be used for a single day off as well as for a period of several days. For this purpose, the period type can be set using the radio buttons. If it is set to "Period", an end date field is visible. This must then be filled with an end date. Please note that the changes made to the operating calendar only become effective after a ClassiX restart. Therefore it makes no sense to define today as a non-working day if users are already logged on to the system. The change is not effective for the users already logged in until they restart the ClassiX system once. See also operating calendar for the effects and links to business objects. Attention Date display in the list: After a change to an operating calendar entry without a subsequent restart, it may happen that the date display in the operating calendar list is still at the old value.

This is the description of the module "busiyear" with the name "Financial year": In addition to an operating calendar for maintaining production times and a personnel calendar for recording and maintaining absences (holidays, sick days) and working with flexitime, this module is used to manage financial years and their periods. The maintenance of the financial years is usually the responsibility of the controlling department. For fiscal years and their periods, any time periods can be entered, e.g. to be able to specify a short fiscal year. After logging in to the system, the closest posting period is automatically registered by means of the session date - when the system is started it corresponds to the system or current date. If the session date is not in a business period declared as started, a warning message is displayed. The currently logged on fiscal year is displayed in the bottom line of the main window. You can - after logging in to the system - change the session date at any time or change to another started fiscal year. In all document masks (outgoing invoices, material postings, time sheets, financial postings, etc.) all started posting periods of the currently logged in - started - business year are always offered for selection. As a rule, however, only one period is/should be started at a time. At the beginning of a new month, two periods are often temporarily started in order to be able to add postings from the previous month. To give the accounting department time for the closing operations of a period, this period is first declared as "finished". This means that it can no longer be selected in all other areas outside accounting. A period is finally closed when it has the status "archived". This is the description of the functionality of the module "busiyear" with the name "Financial year" regarding Input window: After a fiscal year has been created (see the description of the fields), the periods within the fiscal year must then be entered. The total period of the fiscal year should completely cover the periods of the individual periods. If the periods correspond to calendar months, they can be generated automatically (see menu item "Generate periods automatically: Months"), otherwise please create the sub-periods individually. In the sub-periods you must also set the status of a period to be posted to 'started'. By double-clicking on one of the created periods you can edit it. As a rule, you will divide a fiscal year into 12 periods (months). If you want to set up a 13th posting period (or even more) for closing operations, you can set up individual days or limited periods of the last period as posting periods: for example, 30.12.07 and/or 31.12.07 or 28.12.07-31.12.07, 29.12.07-31.12.07. A financial year and its specific period may only be defined once in the system. Within a fiscal year, a period that is exactly the same may also not be contained more than once.

This is the description of the module "stockInput" with the name "Storage": General Price formation on the positionStorage of excess quantities from customer ordersStorage of variant parts Cost centres Cost unit EvaluationInfluence of storage on the moving average price of the part Post CalculationMobile storage. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockInput" with the name "Storage" regarding General: You can post warehouse parts that were entered in the goods receipt to the warehouse or enter other goods receipts (e.g. surplus stock removal ). The other putaways can be assigned to a cost object in order Attention! For QA parts, putaways can only be made if quality assurance documents have been posted for the corresponding goods receipt to be put away. The open quantity of the goods receipt is determined automatically. The following formula is used for this: Sum of all QA quantities - quantity provided to GR - putaways already posted - returned quantity = new quantity for putaway (goods receipt). Example: Goods receipt item 10 pieces has the following successors: = 1 piece open for new storage position ( 7 pieces - 5 pieces - 1 piece ) As no quality assurance has been booked for the last 3 parts, they cannot be stored. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockInput" with the name "Storage" regarding Price formation on the position: There are always 2 prices on the storage position: The standard price of the part from the corresponding roll (production or order roll, depending on the logistics settings) and the price which is the current average price on the stock account or the price from the previous order. For newly created parts and immediate storage, the average price is not yet set. In these cases the field "Price" is writable and a valuation of the goods receipt can be made with this. After a one-time entry and storage, the price is set as the new average price on the warehouse account of the part and can only be changed afterwards by a physical inventory. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockInput" with the name "Storage" regarding Storage of excess quantities from customer orders: If a quantity from a sales order item which contains a variant part is to be put away, a subpart with the corresponding characteristic must first be created. During the putaway process, the system now recognises that this new subpart on the putaway document is a part belonging to the variant part. The putaway can therefore take place with the lower part. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockInput" with the name "Storage" regarding Storage of variant parts: Variant parts can only be put away if they have the indicator 'common warehouse account'. If this indicator is not set, then only a temporary storage can be created for a variant part. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockInput" with the name "Storage" regarding Cost centre: It is possible to assign a storage to a cost centre at any time by checking the box "Cost centre". This is conceivable, for example, if a certain part has been broken on the construction site by an own employee of a certain cost centre. This cost centre was then specifically debited with the replacement of this part. Now this cost centre has procured its own spare part and is to be credited. For this purpose, this cost centre must be specified on the storage. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockInput" with the name "Storage" regarding Cost unit: There is the possibility to relieve a cost unit by storing the goods, this is the case, for example, if an interested party wishes to receive a sample of a part in advance for inspection. In this case, there is not yet an order to which these costs could be linked. In this case it is a good idea to create a project (cost unit) for this interested party in which all costs are collected. The cost unit can be relieved by storing the part if it is not to your liking. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockInput" with the name "Storage" regarding Evaluation: Storage facilities will be provided with 2 prices: 1. price from previous documents (pricePer) 2. price from rolls (last.svpPricePer) The following rules apply for the determination of prices: For price 1: If a preceding document exists, its price is transferred to the goods receipt document, taking all conditions into account. If no preceding document exists, the average price from the warehouse account is used. If no average price exists in the warehouse account either, the price remains at 0. For price 2: If an order exists as a predecessor, the price is taken from the order roll. In the case of a production order as predecessor, the price from the production role. If the item does not have a predecessor, the logistics indicator is used to check whether the price should be taken from the order or production role. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockInput" with the name "Storage" regarding Influence of storage on the moving average price of the part: Which price of the goods receipt changes the moving average price and is thus evaluated in the warehouse statistics, now only depends on the setting for determining the average price on the client. If the option "roll price" is selected, the standard price from the procurement role is used for the valuation. If the option "Document price" is selected, the price from the previous order item including all surcharges and discounts.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockInput" with the name "Storage" regarding Post Calculation: In the post-calculation, a negative value is always included in the valuation for storage. Storage at cost objects always represents a credit (=negative debit). To determine the costs to be credited, the standard procurement type (purchased part / production part) and then the costs are taken from the corresponding role. However, there is one exception: If the putaway has a predecessor (i.e. too much was ordered for one order, the remaining quantity is put away), then the costs are determined from the order. Attention! If a goods issue was posted for a cost object via a purchased part, then the purchased part was converted as a production part and subsequently a goods receipt was created as a credit, then the positive stock removal value continues to be in the purchased parts from stock column, the negative goods receipt value can then be found in the production parts from stock column. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockInput" with the name "Storage" regarding Mobile storage: Mobile storage enables so-called unplanned bookings for a project, order or cost centre to be easily booked. These could be, for example, returns to the warehouse, i.e. parts that have been removed from a workshop warehouse or small parts warehouse for a project can be posted again with this function and the cost object can be discharged. Parts can be selected via storage aids or directly. Storage aids cannot be posted directly, they are only used to find the parts. Empty storage aids should be registered and storage aids with more than one part should be transferred. This booking should not be used as a rule, as planned bookings cannot be processed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockInput" with the name "Storage" regarding Input window: This window is used for the maintenance of storage. You can select a putaway by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". If you want to enter a new putaway, press the OK button (number, date and employee are preset). Then you can add the individual putaway items, i.e. for example, you can post warehouse parts that have been entered in the goods receipt to the warehouse (Goods receipt button) or enter other putaways (e.g. defer excess goods removals ) (Insert button). With the button 'Insert' you can add items to the document that are not in the goods receipt list. The part master opens from which you can select and post further parts. With the button 'Delete' you can remove items from the document and cancel your booking. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockInput" with the name "Storage" regarding Position window: The item number is assigned automatically. For put-away that was not triggered by a goods receipt, the cost object can be assigned via menu or by right-clicking. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockInput" with the name "Storage" regarding List window: Serves to list the storage locations.

This is the description of the module "canceltxn" with the name "Reversal and correction document": The reversal document is generated as a successor to a document. It enables the partial or complete cancellation of this document. At the moment the reversal document supports the following documents: inventory, part request, exploded parts list items. internal order and order items (partial quantities). The document is therefore primarily used to cancel a partial quantity from a parts request, an order or advance requirements, regardless of the processing status of these. In addition, it is possible to document a cancellation (who, when, why) and to take it back again. Document to be reversed Description Inventory No further changes can be made to a cancelled inventory. If the inventory was already posted before the cancellation, this posting is reversed. Part requirements Resolved BOM item internal order Order items (subset) The remaining quantity of the item must be greater than zero and must be greater than or equal to the quantity already staged, delivered or invoiced. If a part request is behind the item, it is also cancelled. Items that have already been produced or delivered are stopped and can be processed further in change management. If it is a dispositive purchased part, i.e. there is a requisition or purchase order directly behind the item, this is checked and if these quantities are too large, a warning message is displayed. The following are documents that can be removed from the DISPO account with the correction document: Document to be corrected Description Part requirements without successor The parts request will be marked as provided without making a further booking. This removes these items from the DISPO account. Only part requests without successors can be corrected in this way. If a successor is available, the document must be cancelled! Goods receipt Goods receipts that are not to be put into storage or returned. When corrected, the goods receipt is set to the status "provided" and is thus removed from the DISPO account.

Then you can enter the supplier's AB number, the order number and the confirmed date in the field 'AB supplier'. This data is then automatically transferred to the order item and the status of the item is set to "Order item confirmed". You can also edit the delivery date by double-clicking in the order item. If several items are confirmed, you can select several order items in the window 'Order items (all)' and drag them with the left mouse button into the window 'Delivery date confirmation'. You can then enter the AB number and the confirmed appointment again. These data are saved in the items and the status is automatically set to "Order confirmed". Press 'OK' to save the data. Please enter the supplier 's order confirmation number, then select the order item (s). When the supplier confirms the desired delivery dates, you can simply press the OK button. If the delivery date is different, you can either enter the confirmed date in the Delivery date field or you can edit the date of an item in the list by double-clicking on it. You must press the OK button to save the changes. The window is then automatically emptied. If you have already confirmed an order confirmation number and you only want to change the delivery date, simply leave the AB supplier field blank, change the item(s) by double-clicking. The desired changes are immediately written into the database. You can select an order by entering the desired number in the Order field and confirm with RETURN. If you want to open the order selection window, you can select the button / menu item "Order".

This is the description of the module "spardire" with the name "Spare parts list": When a complex system is delivered, a spare parts list makes it possible to provide the customer immediately with a spare parts list with unique spare parts numbers which he can refer to in the event of damage. All parts of an order for which the indicator "Spare part" has been set in the part master, the indicator "Spare parts list" in the master parts list or the indicator "Spare parts list" in the production parts list are automatically transferred to the spare parts list. Since a lot of work is also done with variant parts, it can be difficult to agree with the customer which part he needs exactly in which specification. To simplify this, ClassiX offers the possibility to create so-called specifications on the spare part rolls of the variant parts, which describe the attributes. This way, for each variant part version a unique spare part number is created, which enables the customer to describe easily and exactly which part is concerned in the system. If a variant part has several spare part roles, the desired role must be assigned via the context menu on the list. The new E-number can then be assigned via the context menu. This is the description of the functionality of the module "spardire" with the name "Spare parts list" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain spare parts lists. This is the description of the functionality of the module "spardire" with the name "Spare parts list" regarding List window: This window is for listing spare parts lists.

This is the description of the module "olapSupplierList" with the name "Suppliers Article Statistics": With this module a supplier/article or article/supplier statistic can be created for certain periods of time. The basis of these statistics are 2-dimensional OLAP data cubes (see also monitors) between suppliers and article objects. Depending on the selection of the - primary - dimension (i.e. the point of entry) into the statistics, the second remaining dimension is the so-called secondary dimension. If you choose "suppliers" as the primary dimension, the "articles" are the secondary sub-dimension and vice versa.Depending on the selection of the primary dimension (suppliers or articles), the total values of the statistics can vary. This is due to the fact that with "suppliers" sales can also be made without articles (e.g. when using text articles or fixed values in incoming invoices). A statistic according to "Suppliers" can therefore be larger in total than the "same" statistic according to "Articles".The data is updated each time an order, an incoming invoice or a credit note is saved. Whether the values are shown in the totals of the statistics depends on the status of the respective documents. Below is a list of the statuses that are included in the statistics totals for the various documents (the documents themselves are nevertheless always kept in the corresponding data cubes, only the values are not always added up):Order Statistics are not recorded for the following statuses :"Only created""On demand""Call-off order completed""Canceled""Susts"Invoices and credit notes are written to the statistics after releaseAll statistic values are held in local currency only.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "search" with the name "General search terms" regarding Why search terms in dictionaries?: Since the company name should be the one that appears on the company's letterhead, it should be possible to find this company using other, simpler names. This is what the search terms were created for. All search terms are collected in a "dictionary". There are different dictionaries for partners, parts etc. These dictionaries can be imagined like a business directory, which assigns names to the corresponding telephone numbers. Also in the business directory a number can be found under several names and branches. If the name of a partner has been inadvertently overwritten as a search term, so that the partner can no longer be found via his name, or no search terms are available for the imported objects after a data import, the search terms can be rebuilt. When creating a new company, the company name is automatically saved as a search term. However, you can now save any number of additional, perhaps simpler search terms for this company. This is the description of the functionality of the module "search" with the name "General search terms" regarding Assignment of search terms: By linking the keywords to the main object by default, it is possible to find an object in several searches. For example, the keywords that are entered in the customer mask are stored directly at the company. This makes it possible that the company can also be found with this keyword in the supplier search afterwards, provided that the company is entered as a supplier. In ClassiX® we say that the company also has the role of supplier. This concatenation can be optionally switched off if only the customer with this keyword is to be found. Search terms are usually created manually by the user. However, in some modules, fixed data fields are also always included in the search terms, for example, the name of the person in the person editing module. If the name of the person is now changed, the new name is also created as the person's search term without the old one being deleted. The person can now be found using the old and the new name. Note: If in the example of the person the name has been changed because of a spelling mistake, the user should make sure that the corresponding search term is deleted. This is the description of the functionality of the module "search" with the name "General search terms" regarding Limiting the search results: To keep the search clear and not take too long, the maximum number of search results displayed is limited to 100 when the window is opened. If the search term is simply left empty and confirmed with Enter, only the first hundred search results will appear. If you really want all search results to be displayed, you must set the desired number in the menu Options->Number of objects or select the item "All objects". Now, if the search term is empty, the system asks whether all records should really be displayed so that you don't have to wait for all search results by mistake. This can take some time depending on the amount of data. This is the description of the functionality of the module "search" with the name "General search terms" regarding Search methods: The search is inaccurate by default. This means that if only the first part of a word is entered, the system will search for data beginning with that part of the word. In addition, the machine allows the user to work with wildcards. If the entered search term starts with an asterisk followed by a word, the system searches all data that has this entered word anywhere in the search term. The question mark stands for exactly one character, which is unknown, in contrast to the asterisk, where it does not matter how many characters follow or precede. The question mark can therefore be placed anywhere in the word. Examples of this: Another way to perform searches is to use regular expressions in the search term fields. To do this, select "Options->Search->Advanced search" from the menu and enter the search conditions. Now all common regular expressions are available for the search. For example, if you are looking for all companies ending with GmbH, enter the following search term: GmbH$ The search terms entered are not case-sensitive.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions referencing the module description for "General search terms":

1. How do I create custom search terms for my company in the "search" module?

This is the description of the module "purchinvlog" with the name "Incoming invoice status": The list window of incoming invoice items serves as an important tool for the auditors of incoming invoices and credit notes in their work. In addition, it can be used as a statistic. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchinvlog" with the name "Incoming invoice status" regarding Audit of incoming invoice items: If an inspector uses the tool provided by ClassiX®, alternatively he could also look into his processes, he should select in the status list the statuses to which items not yet released are assigned. These are the statuses "in inspection", "item with open GR" and "item with open QA". Afterwards, one can use the search fields to search for the desired items from the selected states. An inspector would thus select himself as an inspector to display all items he still has to inspect. Now that the positions are displayed in the list, the columns with the stop sign and the green check marks or red crosses are of great importance for the test. A stop sign signals to the inspector "Attention, the position could not be released automatically at the time of advancing", so it must now be released by the inspector. (If one selects a position and presses the smart button (yellow lamp), the user receives a short description of the position and the reasons for the check). The next three columns show the auditor whether the audit reasons still apply at the time of list construction. Thus, an item that has three green ticks can be released directly. The inspector can do this directly from the status window by selecting the items and choosing "Release" from the context menu. If a position has a cross in the second and third column, it is assumed that the crosses will still be replaced by a tick when the position has been delivered or checked. Thus, the inspector should not yet release the item directly, but rather wait and see. If there is a cross in the first column (all other reasons, such as value deviation), the inspector can assume that the reasons for the inspection remain the same and therefore cannot avoid becoming active and inspecting the position. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchinvlog" with the name "Incoming invoice status" regarding Single search / multiple search: From the main menu, you can choose between single and multiple search, with multiple search as the default. With the single search, the states to be searched can be limited in the state window and then you can search for documents within these states using exactly one filter. If you search via one field, all other fields are cleared. By pressing the start button (sum symbol in the toolbar) no field is searched but all positions of the selected states are displayed. In the multiple search, all filled search fields marked in blue are & Linked. In this way, for example, all items to be checked for an employee in a certain period can be displayed. In input fields, the search can be started via Return. If an employee or the purchasing area is selected in the combo boxes, the search does not start immediately in order to be able to set further restrictions. In this case, the start button starts the multiple search.

This is the description of the module "receving" with the name "Goods receipt": This module is used to record goods receipts and assign them to orders. The delivered goods can be recorded in the goods receipt. If the order is assigned, the delivered quantity is also noted on the order items. Instructions for printing goods receipts can be found here. This is the description of the functionality of the module "receving" with the name "Goods receipt" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain goods receipts. You can select a goods receipt by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". When you post a goods receipt document, the posting date is saved. The posting must be done manually, otherwise the following departments could process incomplete data. After you have selected the processor (usually specified by logging on to the system), entered the delivery note number, selected a forwarding agent and pressed the 'OK' button, the system assigns a consecutive goods receipt number. The window ' Goods receipt position of delivery note ' opens. Then complete the remaining fields with the actual delivery quantity, weight details and delivery status. In the description field you can store information for subsequent departments. Confirm your entries with the 'OK' button to save your data. With the buttons 'Insert' and 'Remove' you can add or delete further items in the goods receipt document. When you have inserted all the items, the document is saved in the system by pressing the 'Book' button. The system assigns the QA marking that has been stored for the corresponding part in the part master and sets the status to "goods to be inspected" or "ready for delivery". There is one special feature that must be taken into account in any case: quantities ordered for own use, i.e. for a specific cost centre, are not displayed on the warehouse account in the total "In Goods Receipt" or "In QA", as this ordered quantity is not intended for general "dispositive" consumption but only for the specified cost centre! You can then print goods receipt slips and the order items are set to the status "order item has been delivered" in the purchase order with the delivery quantity. By assigning the order process, the order status is automatically changed, thus ensuring that the material flow in the system can be tracked in the areas of incoming goods, warehouse and provisioning. If you need more information about the status of the goods receipt, this can be done by clicking on the button 'Display document history'. The 'Business Process' window opens. In this window all documents are listed (requisition / purchase order / goods receipt etc.) and by double-clicking you can go directly to the corresponding document. Goods receipts that are not to be entered can also be removed from the list of open order items using the function Release incoming invoice. This is the description of the functionality of the module "receving" with the name "Goods receipt" regarding Special feature of Kanban parts: Kanban parts are considered to be put into storage after the goods receipt has been posted. Unless the KANBAN parts must first be transferred to quality assurance, they are only considered to be put away after the quality assurance document has been posted. (see Kanban parts). This is the description of the functionality of the module "receving" with the name "Goods receipt" regarding Label description: Labels (label stickers) can be printed for incoming goods. These are stuck on the individual packaging units or packages that are available in the goods receipt. Thus the goods remain identifiable at all times. To open the label printout, press the menu item " Edit>Print>Label" on the goods receipt header. A window opens with a list of all positions available in the GR. For each line it is indicated how often the label is to be printed and thus in how many packages the specified goods receipt quantity is located. If, for example, 4 amplifiers in 2 large cartons have arrived in the goods receiving area, 2 should be selected as the number of labels. The labels then indicate which carton is involved (package 1 of 2) The number can be initialised above the list by radio buttons to either one label at a time or depending on the quantity for each piece. The number can be changed manually by double clicking on the line. This is the description of the functionality of the module "receving" with the name "Goods receipt" regarding List window: Used to list the goods receipts.

This is the description of the module "cxCity" with the name "Postcodes and area codes": Postal codes always determine a (postal correct) name of a city. In addition to the postcodes for geographical delivery areas, there are also separate postcodes for major customers and post office box cabinets. Keeping a postcode register thus simplifies the entry of place names when entering addresses. In ClassiX® , such postcode registers can be maintained for different countries. If you confirm a postcode with RETURN anywhere in a ClassiX® module (exception: P.O. box address editing module), the system searches for a corresponding entry in the postcode register. If there are several entries for the postcode entered, you can select the correct location from a list. If, in addition, location-specific data (locales) are persistently available in the database, a location can be assigned to them directly. You can thus determine the location as well as its location-specific data via a postcode. The prerequisite for this is, of course, that a postcode register is stored in ClassiX® for each country in question. These country-specific registers can be loaded automatically or entered manually: - For Germany, you can load the postcodes and area codes from the OpenGeoDB database (e.g. at http://fa-technik.adfc.de/code/opengeodb/DE.tab).

This is the description of the module "gantitdm" with the name "Gantt chart for part requirements (Gozintographs)": With this module a gozintograph can be edited interactively in the form of a Gantt chart. Here, the start and end dates and the procurement or throughput times can be changed graphically. These changes take place on a copy of the collective order to be able to carry out simulations or "if-then" situations. A check for material availability and feasibility (Available to promise / Capable to promise ATP/CTP) is also possible here (see checks) The scheduling mode (Schedule/Reschedule, Forward/Reverse) is displayed on the right above the graph. By displaying the critical path, it is possible to filter out the parts determining the end date and to process them directly. Only the shortening of lead times along the critical path has a direct effect on the end date. The gozintograph can be called for non-scheduled part requests, for already scheduled part requests with non-scheduled latecomers or for rescheduling a scheduled part request. Scheduled part requirement items are transferred to the Gantt chart for recalculation of the dates frozen with regard to the earliest start date (start no earlier than) and the latest end date (end no later than) when the graphical forward or backward scheduling is called up from the part requirement module. Only in case of a call via the menu item rescheduling, the dates are released - only for not (even partially) provided part requests. The calculated or manually changed dates and procurement or lead times can then be transferred back to the actual collective order (update project). This is the description of the functionality of the module "gantitdm" with the name "Gantt chart for part requirements (Gozintographs)" regarding Forward scheduling: In forward scheduling, the system plans from an earliest start date into the "future". By default, the current session date is set as the earliest start date. A change is possible by calling up forward scheduling again. Please also note the scheduling via work sequences. This is the description of the functionality of the module "gantitdm" with the name "Gantt chart for part requirements (Gozintographs)" regarding Backward scheduling: In backward scheduling, planning is carried out starting from a fixed end date in the "past". It is quite possible that a calculated start is before the session date of the processing, in which case a warning message is issued. By default, the latest end date is the planned date specified in the parts request (delivery, staging or production date), a change is possible by calling backward scheduling again. Please also note the scheduling via work sequences. This is the description of the functionality of the module "gantitdm" with the name "Gantt chart for part requirements (Gozintographs)" regarding Rescheduling: When rescheduling a part request, by default, all part requests that are not (even partially) provided will start a forward schedule starting from the current session date. This means, for example, that material withdrawals are (can be) always rescheduled - if they have not yet been withdrawn. If, however, an order with a desired or already confirmed date is available for an order part, then this date will be permanently included in the planning as the - initially unchangeable - earliest and simultaneously latest end date. The same applies to production parts whose production has already started: the original dates are taken over into the planning as fixed dates (start not earlier than, end not later than). Graphically, these fixed end points can be recognised by a green triangle to the right (start no earlier than) and to the left (end no later than). Thus, order and production parts can initially only be rescheduled if the corresponding business processes have not yet progressed "too far". These restrictions can be overcome in the planning process by deleting the respective fields "Start no earlier than" and "End no later than": right mouse click on a bar element in the graphic, then select "Edit data", then select the two fields one after the other and delete them with the "Del" key. Only in rescheduling mode can changed finish dates be transferred to a parts request, the departments concerned (Purchasing: Notification of suppliers/production: Rescheduling at workstations) must be informed separately that a changed deadline situation has occurred. After a rescheduling in the graphic, the system checks whether the dates of the subsequent documents (orders, exploded work plans) are still within the new date (from - to). If a follow-on document is no longer within this time frame, a list of all these items appears with the note that the follow-on documents must be rescheduled. For more details see here. The start date can be adjusted to start later than the current session date, or it can be switched to reverse scheduling mode Please also note the scheduling via work sequences.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "gantitdm" with the name "Gantt chart for part requirements (Gozintographs)" regarding Capacity planning: There is also the possibility of dividing the production order blocks into work sequences for parts requirements. For this purpose, the Toobarbutton Capacity Check has to be set to display the clock symbol which is not crossed out. A bar now appears for each sequence of operations. The colour can be used to check whether the scheduled working time still fits into the planned capacity (grey = OK, red = too little capacity). By moving these bars, the work sequences can be directly rescheduled or their throughput times changed. The work sequences can also have a lead time of 0 days, contrary to the parts request items. When updating the project, the start of the first sequence of operations of a part request and the end of the last sequence of operations of the part request are written as new dates on the part request. If a production order has already been created and its work sequences have been exploded, the new dates just set are directly transferred to the work sequences and the end date to the production order item. Thus it is possible to reschedule individual work sequences without any problems. This is the description of the functionality of the module "gantitdm" with the name "Gantt chart for part requirements (Gozintographs)" regarding Scheduling according to production area-specific operating calendars: Only with this type of scheduling is it possible to take into account the operating calendars of the individual production areas or workstations. In the graphical scheduling only the common non-working days are then marked dark. If a calendar week or a day is only free for some work sequences, then these work sequences cannot be shifted into this time period, while other work sequences can fall into this time period. This is the description of the functionality of the module "gantitdm" with the name "Gantt chart for part requirements (Gozintographs)" regarding Graphic: Used to display a gozintograph in the form of a Gantt chart. The dates of the individual parts can be moved by drag & drop or the lead time can be changed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "gantitdm" with the name "Gantt chart for part requirements (Gozintographs)" regarding Options: The following settings can be specified in the options window: Grouping: filters: To get a better overview, it is possible to remove individual disposition types from the diagram. However, this mode is only recommended if rough-cut scheduling has already been carried out once. Otherwise the hidden parts of the filtered out scheduling types remain undermined. Possible filters are:.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "opitglac" with the name "Edit open items G/L account" regarding Care Coupling OPs: In this window the coupling of OPs can be edited. The surgery that has triggered an operation is displayed as the primary surgery and is therefore the first and only one displayed in the surgery list. All other OPs - coupled with this OP - are not displayed, but contribute to the total balance of the OP. (In the OR list, you can optionally set to also display the linked ORs). If you want another OR to be displayed as the primary OR, you can select it as the primary OR by double-clicking on it in the lower part of the window ("Coupled open items").

This is the description of the module "appsched" with the name "Application Calendar": For tasks that are to be executed automatically in the background at certain times or that would place too heavy a load on the DP system during operation, there is the option of moving evaluation, closing and printing tasks to an application calendar. The tasks are then not executed directly, but scheduled for an automatic ClassiX service (server).Such tasks to be executed automatically are managed by means of so-called application calendars (entries). There are basically three different types of application calendars:Recurring tasksInterval tasksOne-off tasksRecurring tasks A task is called "recurring" if the smallest unit for repeating the task is "one day". These are so-called night runs, which are started daily by the system administration. To set up such a "night run" server, a ClassiX start file (e.g. as App Suite (*.cxp) or directly the app applicationScheduleExceute.app) must be executed on a client via batch file, which checks and processes all pending tasks at a certain time (e.g. every night as a cron service of the operating system).An example of an evaluation shifted to the night is the post-calculation of customer orders (this is a so-called system application). In the case of very large and complex orders, the ongoing post-calculation during daytime operations can cause considerable database blockages and waiting times. Such a post-run is activated in the client. Users also have the option of scheduling very extensive evaluations so that these can be found in their saved lists the next morning or these saved lists can be printed out during the night directly on the user's standard printer (these are so-called user applications). Each user can also schedule each evaluation several times with different settings. For each user, a separate user group is created with his specific settings and assigned to the respective user application. Examples of user applications: supply chain management Supplier declaration Only user applications have subordinate user groups with the execution steps they contain. System applications directly contain the execution steps. Once all these recurring tasks have been processed, the service terminates atomatically.Interval tasks If tasks are defined with an "interval", the call is not automatically terminated after all open tasks have been completed and the system repeatedly executes the various tasks at the respective defined intervals. "Interval" tasks are checked every 5 minutes (adjustable with environment variable CX_APP_SCHEDULE_SNIFFER_INTERVAL). Tasks can also be defined.One-off tasks If tasks are neither defined as "Recurring" nor with an "Interval", they are considered "one-off" tasks and are also only executed once. Such one-off tasks are also processed in the so-called night runs. This is the description of the functionality of the module "appsched" with the name "Application Calendar" regarding Input window: This app is used to maintain application calendar (entries). This is the description of the functionality of the module "appsched" with the name "Application Calendar" regarding List: This app is used to list all application calendar (entries). This is the description of the functionality of the module "appsched" with the name "Application Calendar" regarding Position window: This app is used to edit an application calendar (entry), whether group or individual execution. This is the description of the functionality of the module "appsched" with the name "Application Calendar" regarding Execution: There is a central app (applicationScheduleExecute.app) with which all pending application calendars are executed. This app can either be started directly (e.g. for night runs) or included in an app suite using the message EXECUTE_APPLICATION_SCHEDULE. Here, a separate time trigger is set for each interval application calendar (see applicationScheduleTriggeredStart.app), all other recurring or one-time application calendars are also executed. If new application calendars are constantly coming into the system (e.g. through an API), you can start an application calendar sniffer (see cxApplicationSchedule::StartApplicationScheduleSniffer), which searches for new application calendars at specified time intervals and executes them if it is their turn. If a task has been executed, either the task itself or, in the case of repeatable or system tasks, a copy of it is moved to the applications log. If warning or error messages occur during the execution of a task, they are suppressed and written to files separated by month in the directory \System\SystemOut\AppScheduleLog\YYYY-MM\xxxx.log. However, other tasks that have not yet been executed will continue to be executed. Scalability of night runs As there is usually only a short time window available for night runs, it is possible to start several night run instances and assign them to a category. The individual night runs then only perform the tasks that are assigned to their category. Here a main instance, e.g. category A, should be defined, which is then executed shortly before the other instances, so that it can complete leading system tasks (start statistical periods, import latest currency table), which the other instances will use later. A category can therefore be assigned to each application. In addition, each application can be given a code number for the sequence. When the night runs are executed, all applications are sorted in ascending order. Thus, the task with the highest priority has the lowest number. The category of the instance is assigned using the environment variable CX_BATCH_ID. This can be set before calling the system with the command "SET CX_BATCH_ID=A" or via the system environment variables!. This is the description of the functionality of the module "appsched" with the name "Application Calendar" regarding Pending application calendar entries: This app is used to list the application calendar entries to be executed in the near future. Here, for example, you can check what will be started today. The dates of recurring applications are also calculated and taken into account. The user can be set as a filter. Only users for whom due applications are scheduled are displayed in the user list. If no user is registered, the pending tasks of all users are displayed. Using the date field, the due date can also be checked for a date in the future.

This is the description of the module "sstgroup" with the name "Sales statistics groups": The sales statistics groups take over the functions of advance account assignment to cost types/goods accounts and the definition of article group discounts. This is made possible by the fact that they are assigned to the sales roles via the evaluation group "sales statistics" (SALES_STATISTICS). This is the description of the functionality of the module "sstgroup" with the name "Sales statistics groups" regarding Definition of article group discounts: As described in the sales pricing overview, discounts or surcharges can be defined for a group of articles. This group must be linked via the "Sales Statistics" (SALES_STATISTICS) or at least have a common node. If an article is dragged into an order item, the system searches for a discount or surcharge via the statistics group assigned to it or a higher node and then transfers this to the item.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_officeXML" with the name "XML interface for MS Office" regarding Word: Since many documents in the database are only available as COM objects, there is a special tool object which offers the conversion from COM to XML. Like the COM objects, the CX_WORD_XML objects can be created persistently and saved in the database. For performance reasons, not every change to the document is directly transferred to the database, but is initially only recorded in the "transient area" of the object. To record the changes in the database there is the call SaveXMLString. The interface offers the following functionality. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_officeXML" with the name "XML interface for MS Office" regarding Excel: Since Excel documents are usually not kept in the database, there is no way to create a corresponding XML object from a COM object. For performance and storage reasons, there are two operating modes for Excel that support different functionality. Each newly opened Excel document is opened in a very high-performance read-only mode, which allows to process .xlsx files of any size. However, this mode does not support write operations, and the first time an operation is performed on the object, the object is automatically converted and set to write mode. This still provides fast read access to the data, but is limited in the size of the Excel files.

This is the description of the module "paymt101" with the name "Payments (creditor) in international data exchange format MT101": With this module, the open items selected from a payment proposal list are released for payment by creating a financial accounting payment document and (optionally) immediately afterwards the bank data medium is created in the international data exchange format MT101. The creation of the bank data medium in the international data exchange format MT101 can also be called up/repeated separately for a payment run (payment document from financial accounting). MT101 orders can only be executed for those banks for which the BIC (e.g. COBADEFF506) and the sender BIC (e.g. COBADEFFXXX) have been entered in the master data. The amount in foreign currency is always taken first as the respective payment amount; if this is not defined as a payment amount, the payment amount posted to the financial accounting in local currency is transmitted to the bank. No currency conversion takes place. This is the description of the functionality of the module "paymt101" with the name "Payments (creditor) in international data exchange format MT101" regarding Post/create payments Bank data medium in MT101 format: From this window, the open items selected in the payment proposal list are released for payment by bank data medium. This is the description of the functionality of the module "paymt101" with the name "Payments (creditor) in international data exchange format MT101" regarding Create bank data medium in MT101 format: From this window, a bank data medium can be created for a payment document in financial accounting. To do this, enter the document number of the payment run (to be repeated) and the corresponding period. In the repeat run, you have the option of subsequently excluding payments by selection. Since the payments are already posted at this point, this should only be done in exceptional cases. You therefore require special access rights to this function and must then remember to maintain the excluded payments for accounting purposes. In the MT101 file format, a maximum of 4 lines of 35 characters each can be output per individual payment to indicate the purpose of the payment (= open item). If the own number is stored with the supplier, it is output in the first proof of use with "KD nnnn", then all paid documents are output with "NR nnnnn EURxxxxxxx,xx" (nnnnn = invoice or credit note number, EUR the currency of the payment amount, xxx,xx the paid amount (discount is deducted)). If more than 4 open items are paid per payee, these will be divided into correspondingly cleared 1.00EUR payments: if, for example, the amount is 2.000,-€ for a total of 6 open items, the payee will receive a payment/payment statement with 1.999,-€ and 4 open items, as well as a payment/payment statement with 1,00€ and 2 open items.

This is the description of the module "floatfil" with the name "Tasks": In addition to enquiries (= planning) and work orders (= processing), digital circulars (= notification) are the third pillar for carrying out tasks. Each document defined in CyberEnterprise® (e.g. invoice, order, goods receipt, etc.) is subject to one or more predefined business processes. Within such business processes, a document passes through the statuses specified by the business process, e.g. an order can have the status "partially delivered" with regard to the delivery process. In addition to these processes - which are firmly defined by corresponding specifications of the company process organisation - such processes must also be possible in which a user can freely decide who, when, should receive which document for inspection, checking, etc. These freely definable workflows correspond to the circulation folders common in newspapers or magazines, for example, which readers pass on to each other. In CyberEnterprise® (digital) circular files can be created for all documents, but also for any associations to e.g. documents, Excel, Word or pdf files, etc. and passed on electronically between the users. Each user recognises the processes to be processed by him in the folder "My circulars". A digital circular should always be used when direct e-mailing of documents between employees is not sufficient in terms of transparency of an entire process, as the employees' e-mail accounts cannot be viewed by third parties. The mask for creating a new circular depends on the progress indicator of the start state of the selected business process. If a new circular is created directly from a document via a menu item that may be present there in the maintenance screen or via the icon is created, the system checks whether this document has already been assigned to a circular with the same business process. If this is the case, the circular cannot be created in this direct way, but the circular must first be created and the document must be assigned to this circular as an association afterwards. A circular is also only entered as a successor document (in addition to the association) if the circular was created directly from a document. This is the description of the functionality of the module "floatfil" with the name "Tasks" regarding Creating a business process: To create a business process for processing the digital circulars, follow the steps below:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "floatfil" with the name "Tasks" regarding Parallel processing of a task: Floating files are usually processed sequentially. The circular is assigned to the start status - i.e. the first task to be processed - of a workflow and the processing of the data results in the subsequent task until the workflow is completed. A first simple parallelisation of this process is the simultaneous processing of a task by several responsible persons (employees or working groups). This is initiated by the multiple selection of employees/working groups when a task is forwarded. In this case a subtask is created for the subsequent task for each selected responsible person. The possible persons responsible for processing a circular in a status are determined by the status (see: definition of responsibilities). When processing the subtasks, the resources work simultaneously on the same data to be processed of the current task of the circular. This also means that each resource could process and complete the task on its own. Each resource finishes its part of the task by clicking the "Done" button. This causes the task to disappear from the pool of tasks to be completed by the resource. At the latest when the last resource finishes, all data of the task must have been processed so that a follow-up task results. If this is not the case, the completion message is aborted with a corresponding information message. The task is completed by forwarding the circular. If a task is processed by one resource in one, the subtasks of the other resources are marked as completed. Rules can be defined with regard to the responsibilities and completion notification by a responsibility (conditional responsibility and conditional completion notification). This is the description of the functionality of the module "floatfil" with the name "Tasks" regarding Parallel processes and follow-up processes: In parallel running processes and subsequent processes, new circulars are created as successors of an activity by branching to a status of another business process. This is the description of the functionality of the module "floatfil" with the name "Tasks" regarding Input window: This window is used to edit (the current (sub)tasks of a circular. This window is also opened during the initial creation of a circular if the progress indicator of the start state of the selected business process is empty or 0. Otherwise, the direct forwarding window is opened when a circular is created for the first time. The purpose of the distinction between the two windows is that the first creator of a circular sees himself as the initial processor in the workflow with the circular in the input window, while in the forwarding window he only initiates the processing. This is the description of the functionality of the module "floatfil" with the name "Tasks" regarding Forwarding window: This window is opened only when a circular is created for the first time if the progress indicator of the start state of the selected business process EQUAL is empty or 0. Otherwise, the normal input window is opened when a circular is first created. The purpose of the distinction between the two windows is that the first creator of a circular sees himself as the initial agent in the workflow with the circular in the input window, while in the forwarding window he only initiates the processing. This is the description of the functionality of the module "floatfil" with the name "Tasks" regarding List window: This window is used to list and search for floating files.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "floatfil" with the name "Tasks" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select floating files. This is the description of the functionality of the module "floatfil" with the name "Tasks" regarding Option window: All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed with the "OK" button. This is the description of the functionality of the module "floatfil" with the name "Tasks" regarding Introduction: Circulars are controlled by business process objects (CX_WORKFLOW). These should always begin with FLOAT_FILE_xxx as the identifier (uniqueID) to enable a quicker distinction. A distinction must be made between the different workflows for specific business transactions, i.e. the workflow mechanism of the circular file itself. These business processes are to be assigned to the classification term "WORK_FLOW" and therein to the node "FLOAT_FILE". Each activity - regardless of the workflow - is always controlled by the business process FLOAT_FILE_ACTIVITY, which usually only has the statuses "Received", "In process" (after the activity has been called/read for the first time: slot read.date available) and "Completed" (slot end.date available).

This is the description of the module "cxWorkTimeRule" with the name "Flexitime rule": The flexitime rules are available for evaluating the recorded working times. These can be structured differently for different employee groups. For example, an industrial employee may not clock in outside the working time assigned to him, although an employee may.The recording of sick days can also vary: If an employee is only paid by the hour, he or she does not receive a wage for this period. However, if he is an employee, the day is paid.These rules are laid down in the flexitime rules.Technical description:The floating time events write certain bit patterns into the evaluation. These bit patterns are evaluated by these rules and an action number is generated. This action number is then translated into various reactions in the programme code.The possible reactions of the system are the following:Overtime before or after working hours: Recorded time is outside working hours. If it is earlier than normal working time, it is only counted at weekends; on weekdays a message appears. If it is overtime after the end of working time, it is always counted, but on working days an additional notification message is displayed.Recorded working time is within the normal flexitime and is counted as normal working time. (e.g. employee has come within the flexitime but outside the standard working time)Recorded absence lies within the core working time. Only one warning message is issuedRecorded time is normal working time and is also counted as such (like point 2, only within working time instead of flexitime!) (e.g. employee came during working time but outside of break)DiseaseHolidayOn business trips (working time will be credited as normal)Present during a break (working time is NOT counted)Fixed working time (reaction still unclear)Overtime before or after working hours: Recorded time is outside working hours. If it is earlier than normal working time, it is only counted at weekends; on weekdays a message appears. If it is overtime after the end of working time, it is always counted, but in contrast to point 1, an additional message is always displayedPensioners and cleaning staff: working time is always fully countedAdditional days off.Additional planning functionality of the rulesSince the flexitime rules assume that a working time has already been recorded, without a pure planning rule it is not possible to determine in advance how much working time an employee will have to work on Wednesday of the following week. There is an extra rule for this which assumes that no time records have yet been made and only assumes the planned time.This rule can either be specified directly on the employee if he does not stamp, i.e. has fixed working times, or on another rule as a "capacity planning rule".When determining the planned working time, the planning rule is always used if it has been specified. If this link is missing, 0min remaining available capacity is used in planning.Technical description of the evaluationFirst, the evaluation takes the time period to be evaluated and runs through all days individually.For each day, all booked receipts per employee are first collected and the recorded events "coming" (firstComingTime) and "going" (lastGoingTime) are stored in a dailyContainer.The posted events are run through together with the working time events and the action of the latter is always carried out, whereby an action as described above is then determined via the rule.Example In this example, you can see how the working times behave mixed with the posted receipts. The employee has booked an "Arrives" and a "Leaves" receipt. The remaining entries are events from the master data of the working time description. The action is the result of the rule determined from the bit patterns above. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxWorkTimeRule" with the name "Flexitime rule" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain flexitime rules.

As calculation basis the roll price of the part (production part/order item) or the price of the document can be used. This setting can be made under the client, see. In both cases the average price is in the logistics account, but it is calculated on a different basis. On each document the current price iswritten offfrom the document "pricePer" and from the role"last.defaultPricePer". You can check the existing average prices of the stocked parts in the menu "Services --> Materials management" in the index card "Stock account". See Currently the following standard scheme is used: Whenever the average price is changed, the date of the change is also saved in the warehouse account. This is the description of the functionality of the module "aveprice" with the name "Average price calculation" regarding Invoice: The average price is adjusted with each purchase of material as follows: The value for the access price is taken from the slot pricePer (= document price) or last.defaultPricePer (=roll price) depending on the setting in the client. ( old stock * old average price + receipt quantity * receipt price ) / ( old stock + receipt quantity ) ==> new average price Average price is adjusted with each physical inventory document as follows old average price = average.pricePer valuation price = pricePer ( old stock * old average price + counted quantity * valuation price - target quantity * average price ) / ( old stock + counted quantity - target quantity ) ==> new average price The new average price is then rounded to the number of decimal places specified in the system (e.g. for Euro = 2 decimal places) and standardised to the previous per-factor (see examples below). At the same time, this calculation scheme ensures that the respective warehouse account is correct at all times (see also special case 3 below): ( initial stock value + total of all receipts - total of all issues ) / (initial stock + total of all receipts - total of all issues ) = average price Special cases:.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxDocumentComponent" with the name "Document module" regarding Editing the document module in Word: The module is connected to the ClassiX® system by inserting document variables. This is done via the menu insert/field. A window is opened, in which the desired field can be selected. The document variable can be found under the category Document Automation as field name DocVariable. By clicking the OK button a new document variable is created. In the document the entry { DOCVARIABLE \* MERGEFORMAT } is inserted. A second and faster way to insert a document variable is to use the key combination Ctrl + F9. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxDocumentComponent" with the name "Document module" regarding Connect to dynamic data fields: The dynamic data field must be inserted manually. The name of the data field is entered after DOCVARIABLE. Example: Insert the dynamic data field uniqueID: From becomes { DOCVARIABLE uniqueID \* MERGEFORMAT }. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxDocumentComponent" with the name "Document module" regarding Connecting with ClassiX® macros: This connection must also be inserted by hand. The macro call must also be entered here after DOCVARIABLE. The call is made via call(macro name) Example: Insertion of the macro OrderItemDescription: From becomes { DOCVARIABLE call(OrderItemDescription) \* MERGEFORMAT }. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxDocumentComponent" with the name "Document module" regarding Use of members of the ClassiX® objects: Members of the ClassiX® objects are also accessible from Word. To do so, the ClassiX® object is inserted as described above. The access to the object member then follows the C++ convention. Example: Using the String method of the ClassiX® object quantity: From becomes { DOCVARIABLE ordered.shortName \* MERGEFORMAT }. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxDocumentComponent" with the name "Document module" regarding Use of methods of ClassiX® objects: It is also possible to call object methods from Word. For this purpose, the ClassiX® object is inserted as described above. The access to the object method is then done according to the C++ convention. The transfer of parameters is possible. Example: Using the String method of the ClassiX® object quantity: From becomes { DOCVARIABLE quantity.string(NF_DIMENSIONED,NF_SIG_PRECISION) \* MERGEFORMAT }. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxDocumentComponent" with the name "Document module" regarding Formatting of document module: The document module can contain all the formatting options that Word offers. These can also be tables to structure the fields in the module. Simple text can also be inserted and freely formatted. Solves common problems when the selected formatting is displayed incorrectly. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxDocumentComponent" with the name "Document module" regarding Flow control: Word offers the possibility to control the process via branching. This is done with the IF instruction. This is inserted via the menu Insert/Field and by selecting the field name IF in the category Document Automation. The entry { IF } is inserted. The instruction must now be filled with the condition and the instructions for the two cases true and false. The entry is to be changed to The inverted commas next to the statement are important. These encapsulate the statement. In almost all conditions it is checked whether a value is present or not. The condition then looks like the following: { IF { DOCVARIABLE uniqueID } <> " " "statement for true" "statement for false" } This example checks whether the data field uniqueID is not equal to (<>) empty. Note that empty in Word is represented by two double quotes with a space between them. ( " " not "" ) If the condition is still not recognised, the document variable against which the comparison is to be made must also be placed in double inverted commas. Result: { IF "{ DOCVARIABLE uniqueID }" <> " " "statement for true" "statement for false" }.

This is the description of the module "query" with the name "Database query": This module is used to search for information. On the one hand, this can be done using the search terms categorised by object type, and on the other hand using general and more technical query functions. This is the description of the functionality of the module "query" with the name "Database query" regarding Advanced search: The "Advanced Search" window is always accessed via another module. Usually these are list windows, in which there is a field Search terms. If the simple search using the search terms is not sufficient here, this mask can be called up here as an alternative. The results of the search are always sent back to the calling module, which then takes over the display. This is the description of the functionality of the module "query" with the name "Database query" regarding Data preparation and filtering: In the widget for data preparation and filtering, various criteria are specified and linked with each other. During execution, these are arranged in such a way that execution is as fast as possible while the meaning of the configured logical expression remains the same. As soon as it can be decided for an object whether it belongs to the result set for sure or not, no further criteria are evaluated for this object. This is the description of the functionality of the module "query" with the name "Database query" regarding Criteria: At the beginning the widget is still empty and criteria can be added using the green plus. The individual criteria can be removed using the red X on the right-hand side. The order of the criteria can be changed with the arrows on the left side. The individual criteria can be connected by the links AND and OR to form expressions of truth. In addition, the opening and closing brackets can be used for grouping. Unclosed brackets are automatically closed at the end. This is the description of the functionality of the module "query" with the name "Database query" regarding Categories: Each criterion can be from one of five categories: Query, Attribute, Formula, Callback or InstantView. A criterion of type Query defines a condition for a data field of an object so that it belongs to the result set. The first of the fields defines the access expression to be tested. Instead of the access expression, the name of a column can also be entered. Using the button with the three dots next to the field, either an access expression can be selected via the access expression configurator or one of the defined columns. In the middle the comparison operator is selected and then the value to be compared with is entered on the right. If a method is selected and it cannot be used in a query expression, the criterion is automatically converted into one of the type callback during execution. A criterion of type attribute defines an attribute with a comparison operator and a comparison value. For each object it is checked whether it has the corresponding attribute and whether the value of the attribute matches the relational operator and comparison value. With a criterion of type formula, a formula is defined which is then evaluated for each object. If the formula returns TRUE (or a value that evaluates to TRUE), the object belongs to the result set, otherwise it does not. A criterion of type Callback specifies InstantView® source code that is called for each object. The object is at the top of the stack. The source code should return a value at the end that is TRUE if the object belongs to the result set, otherwise a value that evaluates to FALSE. A criterion of the InstantView type is different from the other criteria in that it is not called for each object individually. Instead, when the specified InstantView® source code is executed, a collection with the previously selected objects is on the stack and at the end a collection with objects on the stack is expected again. The use of this criteria type offers full flexibility in editing options. Naturally, a criterion of this type cannot be moved to another point of processing, so a criterion of the InstantView type interrupts the optimisation. Criteria before and after this criterion are optimised on their own, but it is ensured that all criteria before this criterion are executed before and all criteria after this criterion are executed afterwards. For the same reason no brackets can be defined for this criterion and all previously opened brackets are automatically closed. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. Can we filter search results based on multiple attributes? How do we specify multiple criteria in the advanced search window?
2. What are the different types of criteria available in the query module? How do they differ from one another?
3. Can we group criteria together using parentheses? How do we use parentheses to define complex queries?
4. What is the purpose of the "Query," "Attribute," "Formula," "Callback," and "InstantView" categories in the criteria section? How do we choose the appropriate category for our desired search criteria?
5. Can we use the search terms field to perform a basic search without accessing the advanced search window? If so, how do we do this?
6. How do we remove unwanted criteria from the search mask? Is there a quick key or shortcut for doing so?
7. Can we rearrange the order of criteria in the search mask? If so, how do we do this?
8. Are there any limitations to the number of criteria we can add to the search mask? If so, what are those limits?
9. Can we save frequently used searches as presets within the query module? If so, how do we create and manage these presets?
10. Does the query module support wildcard characters or regular expressions in search queries? If so, how do we use them?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "query" with the name "Database query" regarding Parameter: Parameters can be used to determine the criteria dynamically during execution. This is useful, for example, to start reports for the current month. Parameters can be used for criteria of type Query, Callback or InstantView, but not for formulas. The easiest way to use parameters is to use the button with the three dots to the right of the corresponding fields. In the selection you have the possibility to define new parameters or edit existing parameters. The definition of a parameter is replaced by its value during execution. If parameters are to be defined manually, this can be done using the following syntax: ${Name := Initialisation}$ Name stands for the name and is optional (in this case := is also omitted). The name can be given either as a simple string or multilingual as T("first language", "second language"). Initialisation contains InstantView® source text that is evaluated during execution and calculates the current value of the parameter. This source text can contain the following constants: If the check box Query parameters is selected for a criterion, a window with the parameters of this criterion and the calculated values is displayed during execution. The names of the parameters are used for this. The values can still be changed in the window. Since valid InstantView® syntax is expected during initialisation, pure text specifications (e.g. as pre-entered values in the parameter query) must be stored in string notation with double inverted commas. Otherwise the text will be wrongly interpreted as a statement and not recognised: ${name := "given string"}$ In addition to the initialisation via source code, there is also the possibility to use selection windows for the values of the parameters. The syntax for this is then ${Name := //START_MSG;END_MSG}$ Name is again the name of the parameter. START_MSG defines the message to be sent to open the selection window and END_MSG defines the message to return the result from the selection window.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "Database query" module with the feature of dynamic parameters based on the provided module description:

1. How do I create a parameter in the "Database query" module?
2. Can I use parameters to filter my report data based on dynamic conditions?

This is the description of the module "purchaseOrder" with the name "Order": When creating an order, great care must be taken to ensure that it is also created cleanly. This means, among other things, that an order of the type OWNER'S REQUIREMENT also absolutely needs a cost centre so that the type is completely "pronounced" and the corresponding costs can also be assigned accordingly.Attention own requirements! Goods that are ordered as own requirements do not end up in the warehouse or in customer provision! It is only to be used for real own requirements (office supplies, swivel chairs)! With the type CUSTOMER REQUIREMENT it is also essential to specify a predecessor, i.e. a cost unit, so that the costs are also allocated there accordingly. An order is only completely created, i.e. it gets the status triggered, if these conditions have been satisfied. If these conditions are not met, the order can neither be processed in subsequent documents nor printed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchaseOrder" with the name "Order" regarding Vendor purity: Each purchase order that is generated is supplier-pure. This means the following in detail: Note: If orders are created "by hand", supplier purity cannot be guaranteed. In this case, the user himself is responsible for the purity of the order!. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchaseOrder" with the name "Order" regarding Determining the supplier: When orders are created automatically, the principle is usually to determine the A supplier as the supplier from whom orders are to be placed. In detail, the following steps are used to try to determine a supplier. If a step delivers a supplier, this supplier is included in the order and the following steps are no longer taken into account. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchaseOrder" with the name "Order" regarding Document settings: The presetting of the voucher runs in three stages. The first stage here is the initialisation of the mask without an order. This step is very straightforward, as all fields are cleared and only the logged-in user is set as the processor. The second stage is the creation of the order by saving the order for the first time. Here, the standard document settings are used, which can be stored for the user, the user's cost centre or the client. This could be, for example, the cover letter or standard conditions of the client. It should be mentioned that fields that are filled are not overwritten. For example, if the field "1st signature" was set before the first saving, it will not be overwritten by the value of the field "1st signature" of the document settings. The third stage is to select the supplier. Here, for example, predefined fields such as vendor (specification in the vendor master) or address (P.O. Box address before street address) are filled. In addition, the standard document settings of the supplier are taken over. If, for example, another creditor or another address was selected in these document settings, the field is overwritten. If a cover letter or footer text is taken over via the document settings, the old text module is replaced. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchaseOrder" with the name "Order" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain orders. You can select an order by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". The order texts for the document footer can optionally be entered as text or as a Word document and combined with text modules. The window is closed without saving changes. If you want to save the changes, you must press the "OK" button. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchaseOrder" with the name "Order" regarding If this option is set, the cost price of the order item is taken over as the order price and thus overwrites the supplier's standard order price.: Option window Adopts the default settings as they were at initialisation, before they may have been changed by the editor.

This is the description of the module "itemVarianceAnalyze" with the name "Parts Variance Analyser": The constantly changing requirements in the markets lead to a constant adaptation and expansion of the own product range (external variance). In addition, the company's own engineering and production also contributes to changes in the parts used (internal variance). This external and internal variance often leads to a constant growth of the own parts base and can lead to increasing difficulties to configure the own products customer-specific and error-free.Carefully constructed parts classes or other ontologies can help to keep an overview and order in the parts master, but they usually cannot prevent the parts master from growing per se. Also missing is the definition of a configuration logic for the own products.By introducing sustainable variant management, the growth of the parts master can be slowed down sustainably, which automatically leads to an increased overview, improved order in the parts master and overall to improved efficiency in the production process. On the other hand, the necessary configuration logic for one's own product range results almost in parallel.For this purpose, it is first necessary to find "similar" parts in the part master, i.e. to find and structure groups of parts in such a way that the individual members of a group can only be unambiguously described by different versions of one and the same set of characteristics. The attribute scale itself is determined by the group and is therefore valid for all members (parts) of the group.For each group of parts, a so-called variant part with its specific characteristics is then created. The parts of the group are then assigned to the variant part as so-called sub-parts, whereby the characteristics list is defined for each of these sub-parts according to the characteristics of the sub-part. The sub-parts assigned to a variant part clearly show the differences between these sub-parts with regard to the characteristic values of the features.Here it can often already be established that sub-parts have been defined unnecessarily, since their characteristics - clearly described by the characteristic bar - are quite comparable and even substitutable with other sub-parts of the same variant part.The consistent introduction of product features, product feature strips and variant parts gives the entire parts master a clear structure. The focus is no longer on the individual parts, but rather on material features, i.e. characteristics that determine the parts to be used. The rules of configuration logic then only refer to characteristics - i.e. properties - and no longer directly to part numbers.This separation of the configuration logic from part numbers also makes it possible to determine configurations with parts for which there is still "no part number": in this case, the configuration determines variant parts with those characteristics for which there is (still) no subpart in the variant part. This does not have to be the case, because the desired - non-existent - part is clearly specified by the variant part and the distinct attribute list. With this unambiguous specification, it can be processed throughout the entire logistics process even without a system in the part master.Variant parts and their associated lower parts with a distinct list of characteristics can thus help to increase the diversity of the product range without creating an overflowing parts master: in this way, variance can be controlled. This is the description of the functionality of the module "itemVarianceAnalyze" with the name "Parts Variance Analyser" regarding Functionality: With this module, groups of parts can be found by examining the words in the part designations. For this purpose, all part designations are first broken down into the individual words. Each of these words holds all the parts in whose part designation this word occurs. By forming intersections or unions of these individual words it is easily possible to put together groups of parts of "similar" parts. This is the description of the functionality of the module "itemVarianceAnalyze" with the name "Parts Variance Analyser" regarding List window: In this window, the entire functionality for analysing the variance of a parts master is summarised.

This is the description of the module "ordergrp" with the name "Position group": Via item groups, any number of order items can be divided into groups. Appointments can be assigned collectively for these groups, which can then also be transferred directly to all subitems. It is also possible to mark groups as option groups in the offer - their costs are then not included in the total offer, these groups are ignored when they are transferred to an order. Fixed sums can also be defined on the group for all subitems. Furthermore, different recipients can be entered on the group, if, for example, a pallet with goods is to be delivered to the customer's external warehouse, or the delivery of dangerous goods has to be cleared at another gate. This is the description of the functionality of the module "ordergrp" with the name "Position group" regarding Status determination for order groups: Order groups usually do not have their own delivery or billing status, as the corresponding order status is determined from the items. Groups with a fixed total without subheadings are an exception. These groups can be used to sell flat-rate supplies and services via the order, which cannot be entered via an item consisting of an article or a service in a corresponding quantity. Here it does not matter what type of group (order group, service provider group, etc.) is involved. Since the statuses for such groups cannot be determined via the invoice or delivery quantity, the statuses are forwarded via the "already delivered" and "already invoiced" labels in the order groups. The corresponding fields are only displayed if the group has a fixed total but no sub-items. If items are inserted into a group which have been marked as "already delivered" or "already invoiced", the items do not receive the corresponding status. Only after the identifier has been removed at the group level, the items are linked to the corresponding status. This is the description of the functionality of the module "ordergrp" with the name "Position group" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain position groups. This is the description of the functionality of the module "ordergrp" with the name "Position group" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain position groups. This is the description of the functionality of the module "ordergrp" with the name "Position group" regarding Input window - Service provider group - Work certificate: The service provider groups, also called work certificate groups, differ from normal order groups in that an employee who is to carry out work can be entered and booked here with a planned date and a planned working time. This group thus serves the capacity planning of employee resources. It represents the planned requirements. In offers the indicator"Reserve demand" can be set, so that the booking of working time can be reserved already in the offer status. If an order is then created from the quotation, the quotation group is automatically booked out and from now on only the order group is booked, so that the capacity requirement is not booked twice. If the order group is deleted, the quotation group is automatically booked again. See also the topic on service provider groups and capacity planning in general Attention: The capacity of the group remains booked in the employee requirement until it receives the indicator "Closed"! Special features of capacity planning via service provider groups: If several successive service provider groups are scheduled for an employee and the end date of the first group is postponed due to rescheduling, all subsequent service provider groups that do not have the "Fixed scheduling" indicator are also automatically postponed! Service provider groups are scheduled on the basis of the capacity available to the employee. This capacity is reduced by the time entries booked on that day and by other groups scheduled for an earlier start date. The setting for capacity planning in the client plays a role here: If day-based scheduling is activated, the employee must already have specified how much working time is available to him daily in the desired period. If this has not been done, an error message is displayed during dispatching. Using this method via the client, the day-specific scheduling can even be switched off completely. Furthermore, it is possible to preset via the client whether follow-up work should generally be dynamically postponed or not. 
Sure, I'd be happy to assist! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. Can order groups be designated as option groups in the offer, and if so, how does this affect the pricing?

9. How does the automatic postponement of succeeding service provider groups work when the end date of the first group is rescheduled, and what are the implications for capacity planning?
10. Can I switch off day-based scheduling entirely in the client settings, and if so, how does this impact the scheduling of employees and the availability of capacity?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "ordergrp" with the name "Position group" regarding Input window - component variant group: Component variant groups are input simplifications for several identical parts in different variations. The item variant group can either be created manually via the order tree or from an existing order item via the "Create item variant group" button. In addition, the component variant group for textiles has a size grid which selects the size attribute of the part selected via the group, extracts the enum table from it and displays all entries as input fields. Then only the quantities (without units) have to be entered into the size fields and the positions generated with ALT-S. The entered quantities are retained even after the mask is closed, so that a quantity can be added or changed again for a size. When saving, the system checks whether there is already an order item in the size and if so, only the quantity is adjusted. Attention! When moving items from the bottom to the top in the item variant group: The order tree in the background cannot notice this change, therefore the order on the order tree remains at the old status, although the order was saved correctly! To update the list, switch to the list view once via the button and then back to the tree view again The component variant group uses a selection of characteristics of the sales article for fast processing and displays these for each item in the variant data list. The quantity and all these characteristics can be quickly adjusted for all items by double-clicking. After processing, the system must determine any existing sub-parts that have resulted from the newly set characteristics. For this purpose it is important that the group is saved before leaving. A prompt is displayed when closing the window if characteristics have been changed and not yet saved. The selection of characteristics can be changed in the group by pressing the button above the variant data list can be changed. This changed sequence is saved for the group which has just been changed. If the preselection is to be changed generally for the sales part, it can also be changed directly in the sales item role by pressing the button can be adjusted above the list of object characteristics.

This is the description of the module "paydtaus" with the name "Domestic creditor payments in German data exchange format DTAUS": With this module, the open items selected from a payment proposal list are released for payment by creating a financial accounting payment document and (optionally) immediately afterwards the bank data medium is created in the German data exchange format DTAUS for domestic payments. The creation of the bank data medium in the German data exchange format DTAUS can also be called up/repeated separately for a payment run (payment document of the financial accounting). This format becomes invalid from 1.2.2014. This is the description of the functionality of the module "paydtaus" with the name "Domestic creditor payments in German data exchange format DTAUS" regarding Posting/creating payments Bank data medium in DTAUS format: From this window, the open items selected in the payment proposal list are released for payment by bank data medium. This is the description of the functionality of the module "paydtaus" with the name "Domestic creditor payments in German data exchange format DTAUS" regarding Create bank data medium in DTAUS format: From this window, a bank data medium in DTAUS format can be created for a payment document in financial accounting. To do this, enter the document number of the payment run (to be repeated) and the corresponding period. In the repeat run, you have the option of subsequently excluding payments by selection. Since the payments are already posted at this point, this should only be done in exceptional cases. You therefore require special access rights to this function and must then remember to maintain the excluded payments for accounting purposes. In the DTAUS file format, a maximum of 15 individual details of 27 characters each can be output per individual payment to indicate the purpose of the payment (= open item). If the own number is stored with the supplier, it is output in the first proof of use with "KD nnnn", then all paid documents are output with "NR nnnnn xxxxxxx,xxEUR" (nnn = invoice or credit note number, xxx,xx the paid amount (discount is deducted)). If more than 15 open items are paid per payee, these are divided into correspondingly cleared €1.00 payments.

This is the description of the module "cxInstallationCharges" with the name "Proof of assembly": Installation certificates or passes are the documents that field service technicians fill out to identify their activities. In most cases, the hours worked are reported and any material used can also be reported. The hours worked (and additional arrival, departure or waiting times, as well as surcharges and discounts) are specified more precisely by means of service articles, the material can be specified in the form of sales articles or spare parts (cost-type accounting). An installation certificate is always assigned to the employee who performs the work and can therefore also serve as the basis for an expense report. Through assignment to an order or an order item, the costs incurred are accumulated in the order and project within the scope of the final costing (cost unit accounting). For the purposes of cost centre accounting, the cost centre(s) to be debited can be specified directly; by default, the employee's cost centre is always used first. For a percentage distribution of the costs to different cost centres, the cost distribution on the "Evaluation" tab can be used. After registering the apportioned cost centre costs, this assembly record appears in the assembly cost allocation book. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxInstallationCharges" with the name "Proof of assembly" regarding Proof of assembly vs. group of service providers (work certificate): The proof of assembly and the service provider group are in competition with each other. Both are proofs that are created, for example, by the deployment of fitters. However, they differ in the way the costs are allocated. The costs arising from an assembly certificate are not invoiced directly to the customer. This is the case, for example, for service work under warranty. In contrast, groups of service providers are invoiced as part of a customer order using an invoice. In practice, however, choosing the right document to record the costs incurred can be quite difficult. The service provider group, for example, is generated directly when the service call is entered and is also used for capacity planning. It is therefore created before the service technician carries out the service order. If it turns out during installation that the work carried out is to be considered as warranty after all, the wrong document was chosen. ClassiX supports you with this problem by providing an interface between the documents. From the service provider group, for example, an assembly proof can be generated, if it is a warranty after all. The order group is automatically cancelled and thus not invoiced to the customer. In the opposite case, a service provider group can be initialised on the basis of an assembly certificate, if the alleged warranty was a service order after all. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxInstallationCharges" with the name "Proof of assembly" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain the header data of an assembly verification object. You can select an assembly verification object by entering the desired number in the "Number" field and confirming with RETURN.

This is the description of the module "deftrans" with the name "Document settings": This module is used to maintain the document presettings, which can be made depending on the document type (offer, order, ) The default settings can be specified for internal objects (client, account, user). In this way, for example, all employees of a cost centre can receive an individual order letter. On the other hand, the partner objects and their roles can hold document presettings. Thus, a contact person for an order can be defined for a customer, who is to be set automatically when the order is created. This is the description of the functionality of the module "deftrans" with the name "Document settings" regarding Document-specific default settings: The input window is used as a cockpit for the document presets. Here you can make standard settings for general document data (subject, cover letter, conditions) and also select the standard print form. However, the respective module is responsible for the document-specific presettings. The corresponding mask can be called up via the "Advanced" button. The documentation of these specific presetting masks can be found here and elsewhere:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "deftrans" with the name "Document settings" regarding Conditional document presets: Document-specific presetting can be linked to conditions (Edit - Insert - conditional). As an example, different delivery data can be stored for a customer depending on the selected order type (orderTypeEnum=xy). In the order window, after setting the order type (save) and selecting the customer, the corresponding delivery data is integrated. This is the description of the functionality of the module "deftrans" with the name "Document settings" regarding Input window: The input window consists of two parts. In the list of documents, the documents for which a document preset has been made are displayed. The document preset group then displays the corresponding settings. Here, a further distinction is made between general settings and typical document settings. The general settings include the subject, the cover letter, the footer text and the conditions.

This is the description of the module "cxWorkTimeModel" with the name "Working time model": Working time models can be created and assigned for employees and cost centres. Events are used to define the working times within a working time model.They determine, for example, when the working day begins and ends and when or how long the breaks are.By means of these working time models defined in this way, the capacity of the employee can be automatically determined and saved for a defined period of time in capacity planning. The system then recognises, for example, that the employee works 8 hours on Mondays and Tuesdays, but only 7 hours on Fridays.In order for capacity planning to take these working times into account, the employee must be assigned to a time rule that refers to the "capacity planning rule". This is specified on the time rule or directly on the employee if the employee does not clock in and the working time model is only to be used for his capacity planning.{img fileId="519"}.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "multiLingual" with the name "Multilingualism" regarding Introduction: In a globalised economy one is constantly confronted with foreign languages and foreign currencies. In this section we will look at foreign languages and describe how multilingualism is handled in the CyberEnterprise business OS. But first, some definitions of terms: CyberEnterprise business OS basically distinguishes between an operating language and a document language. The operating language is the language in which the screen masks are displayed and the machine is operated. It is possible to change the operating language during operation. This is done via the buttons with the country flags ( ): All language-dependent elements (menu labelling, buttons etc.) automatically adapt to the selected language. German and English are implemented as operating languages by default. Further languages can be added as required using the Text Literal Browsers for system messages and user texts. The document language is the language in which texts are entered and output. In principle, the document language is independent of the operating language, i.e. with an operating language set to "German", i.e. with a "German" user interface, it is possible, for example, to enter an offer with English texts. This is the description of the functionality of the module "multiLingual" with the name "Multilingualism" regarding Multilingual user interface: Texts for graphical user interface (GUI) elements can be created in source code within the CyberEnterprise business OS. You can find more information on this under: Technical documentation (AppsWH) Multilingualism in texts.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "MultiLingual" module, based on the given description:

1. How do I change the operating language of my CyberEnterprise business OS?
2. Can I add additional languages beyond German and English as operating languages? If so, how?
3. What is the difference between the operating language and the document language in the MultiLingual module?

This is the description of the module "slotsbas" with the name "Dynamic data fields (slots)": With this application you can create dynamic data fields (slots), make them persistent and then maintain them. It is also possible to display the objects that use a particular dynamic data field from this module (see menu item "Usage"). One must be aware that only persistent slots can and may be changed. That is why slots created at runtime, first transient ones, must be made persistent before they can be changed. Transient slots of the ClassiX® system, i.e. slots that are loaded from the *.DIC and *.INI files when the system is started up, must neither be changed nor made persistent. Slots once created and made persistent cannot be deleted. However, you can, for example, add their name "ZZ_" and mark them as "deleted", so to speak. Created slots that are still transient cannot be deleted either, but will no longer be available when the system is next booted. Making slots persistent can only be done from the list window, this is a security measure. For example, if you have created several transient slots and you don't want to keep one of them, you can make the slots you want to keep persistent, restart the system and then only the persisted slots will be available. The created transient slot will no longer be displayed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "slotsbas" with the name "Dynamic data fields (slots)" regarding List window: This list shows all dynamic data fields available in the system.

This is the description of the module "literalAppsWH" with the name "English:Text Literal Browser: AppsWarehouse": This app is part of the multilingualism of the CyberEnterprise business OS and is responsible for the texts in the different operating languages. With this app, the texts occurring in the AppsWarehouse® (InstantView® code) (see also Text Constants in the InstantView® Framework) can be is displayed, adapted to specific company requirements and/or can be translated into all other languages required. By default, all texts in AppsWarehouse® Code (window titles, field labels, hint texts, etc.) are written in German as the first and English as the second, so-called bridge language. The respective expressions in these two languages together form the "key" for unambiguous identification of a text. Using this "key", the texts can be changed (for alternative designations: e.g. device - instrument - installation) and/or freely assigned to a language as of the third language (French). These extensions and/or changes to the texts from the AppsWarehouse code are written to the file appsWHLiterals.stg (formerly: cxstring-uc.002) with the above-mentioned "key" (see Stored text constants in file cxstring_uc.002).At runtime, the displayed texts are then adapted/overwritten/extended using the entries in this file.In addition, you can have a *.info file created (usually cxstring-uc.002.info), by means of which you can freeze a specific version of the AppsWarehouse text constants. If changes are made in the AppsWarehouse code afterwards, it can be determined in which modules/apps certain text constants used to be (see Text constants unrelated to AppsWarehouse®).The languages that can be selected or used at runtime are defined in the location-specific data (language, system number of the language). How many and which languages are actually to be used within an application is specified in the client under System/Language Control. If nothing is specified there, the number of languages is determined directly from the location-specific data. This is the description of the functionality of the module "literalAppsWH" with the name "English:Text Literal Browser: AppsWarehouse" regarding List window (Text Literal Browser: AppsWarehouse).: This window is used to list all text literals that occur in the AppsWarehouse® (i.e. in the InstantView® code). The loading/listing is done via the menu item "Load Text Literals of the AppsWarehouse" or the corresponding button in the toolbar. The two tabs show different views of the text literals in AppsWarehouse®. The first tab shows all occurrences in the AppsWarehouse® starting from the literals, while the second tab shows the various associated literals starting from the access expressions. This is the description of the functionality of the module "literalAppsWH" with the name "English:Text Literal Browser: AppsWarehouse" regarding Literals: If an entry is marked in the list, all places where the marked text occurs are output in the lower list (used in AppsWarehouse). A double click opens either the corresponding window or the position in the code. The texts of a Text Literals itself are maintained by double-clicking in the editing window. This is the description of the functionality of the module "literalAppsWH" with the name "English:Text Literal Browser: AppsWarehouse" regarding Access Expressions: This tab is mainly used to book access expressions with the corresponding literal in data connectors. The upper part is used to filter the desired access expressions, while the lower part is used to select and update the corresponding literal. It is also possible to automatically update several access expressions at once. This is the description of the functionality of the module "literalAppsWH" with the name "English:Text Literal Browser: AppsWarehouse" regarding Editing window (Text Literal Editor: AppsWarehouse): This window is used to maintain individual text literals of the AppsWarehouse. The default languages are German and English. If text literals are changed (as alternative names) or languages are added, these text constants are stored in the file with the name appsWHLiterals.stg in the current system directory (this usually corresponds to the directory CX_ROOTDIR\system). Whether and which texts have been changed or extended by further languages can be displayed in the list window via the menu item Saved text constants in file appsWHLiterals.stg. ATTENTION: The file appsWHLiterals.stg is created for the first time when loading the text literals from the AppsWarehouse. It is therefore already present even if you have not yet changed any text constants. In this "empty" state, the file can be deleted without disadvantages, but if text constants have been changed or languages have been added, these entries are irrevocably lost when the file is deleted. This is the description of the functionality of the module "literalAppsWH" with the name "English:Text Literal Browser: AppsWarehouse" regarding Text Literal Wizard: AppsWarehouse: This window is used for mass maintenance of AppsWarehouse text literals. This is the case if a company wants to generally change some of the designations used in the standard AppsWarehouse (e.g. Product -> Production item). This is the description of the functionality of the module "literalAppsWH" with the name "English:Text Literal Browser: AppsWarehouse" regarding Text Usage Wizard: AppsWarehouse: This window is used to maintain the use of the text constants in the programme code, i.e. changes are made directly in the programme in the code. This is the description of the functionality of the module "literalAppsWH" with the name "English:Text Literal Browser: AppsWarehouse" regarding Stored text constants in file appsWHLiterals.stg: This window lists the text constants stored in the file appsWHLiterals.stg. If the list is empty, no text constants have been changed, nor have additional languages been added. This is the description of the functionality of the module "literalAppsWH" with the name "English:Text Literal Browser: AppsWarehouse" regarding Text constants without relation to AppsWarehouse: If text constants have been changed or additional languages have been added to them (i.e. there are stored text constants in the file appsWHLiterals.stg), but they no longer appear there due to changes in the AppsWarehouse code, they will be listed in this window.

This is the description of the module "offorita" with the name "Offer-Order Attributes Editing Window": If an order or quotation contains many identical variant parts with always slightly different specifications, it is more economical to be able to use the same specifications for all of them. To be able to set the same attributes quickly and clearly, this window is provided. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorita" with the name "Offer-Order Attributes Editing Window" regarding Input list: This list represents all transferred order items with their defined attributes. If an entry is double-clicked, its attributes are displayed in the position editing window, where the value can be adjusted manually. If several order items have been selected in the list and the editing mask has been opened via the Edit button, all changes to the attributes are carried out for all selected items. This is also how the conversion from conditional to preset attributes and vice versa works. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorita" with the name "Offer-Order Attributes Editing Window" regarding Editing window: In this window, all attributes of the first marked order item are displayed. By double-clicking on the corresponding list line (attribute) the manual value is released for changes. Now different values can be entered here and you can observe how these changes affect the other attributes. If other attributes are conditional or formula attributes and dependent on the one just changed, the values are updated after clicking the "Calculate" button. In order to keep a clear overview of the changes, the list is divided into 3 columns: If there are conditional or calculated attributes in the list, but the result is still to be adjusted slightly, the context menu (right-click on the list entry) offers the possibility to convert these conditional and formula attributes into preset ones (Formula / Replace condition with fixed value). The new preset attribute is given the same value as the calculated one. Now this can also be changed manually. Please note, however, that after such a conversion this conditional attribute will no longer react to any changes of other attributes! It now has its fixed value! Also note that in the master attributes for each of the conditional and formula attributes there is a preset attribute with the same data field! If the new preset attribute is to be converted back to its conditional original form after all, this can also be done via the context menu. Here there is another entry that takes over this function (Formula / Restore Condition). The changes are only applied to the order items when the "OK" button on the list window is pressed!.

This is the description of the module "serinumb" with the name "Serial numbers": A serial number is a character string used to identify one or more parts. It is important to understand that despite multiple uses (even two suppliers could use the same serial number), a serial number is in principle unique. In ClassiX a serial number is therefore modelled by 3 objects (see data model) 1. the reference to the serial number object (via a CX_SERIAL_NUMBER ACCOUNT object to an object of type CX_SERIAL_NUMBER) 2. the references to the business objects, including the part Other business objects could be the supplier who delivered the part and assigned the serial number or an industrial plant to which the part was delivered or which represents the part itself (device or plant) 3. the references to the documents that the part has passed through This information makes it possible to identify a part and its movements clearly and transparently.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_serinumber" with the name "Serial numbers - Processes" regarding General: A serial number is a unique string of characters used to identify a part of a series. They can be found on all types of products and are used for warranty purposes, quality control, detection of stolen goods and counterfeits. The term is also used when referring to alphanumeric identifiers which are used for unique identification. The aim is to seamlessly document all movements and processing of each serial numbered part. In this way information can be provided at any time for a clearly identifiable part. Via the document history, the individual processing stages of the parts with the respective serial numbers can be traced and viewed transparently. This includes, for example, information about which part of a series was stored at which storage location. But also how and when it was processed and where it was delivered to under certain circumstances. In order to define a part in ClassiX as serial number managed, the option "Serial number managed part" must be set via the logistics account in the group warehouse account. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_serinumber" with the name "Serial numbers - Processes" regarding Serial numbers at the storage place: The identification "Serial number managed part" means that the serial numbers of the moving parts are carried along with the goods receipt and all stock entries. For goods receipt this is still optional under the option "bound serial numbers". At the latest at storage, transfer and removal from stock of serially guided parts, a recording of the serial numbers in the amount of the quantity is mandatory. When posting the documents, the serial numbers are automatically assigned to or removed from the parts warehouse account depending on the stock movement. This functionality ensures that at any time in the system it is possible to identify which serial numbers are located in which storage bins. In addition, it is possible to see how a serial number was further processed via the stock removal and its predecessors. If a part is only defined as a serial number-maintained part at a later date, manual reworking of the serial numbers and their allocation to the storage locations is also possible. Via the input window of the serial numbers under the point "Business objects" -> "Insert" -> "Stock account part" the part including the stock account can be defined as serial number managed part and thus serial numbers can be assigned to this part afterwards. During stocktaking, the system checks whether the number of serial numbers assigned to the partial storage bin account corresponds to the quantity counted. If this is not the case, the serial numbers of the counted parts must be assigned to the inventory item. By posting the inventory, the serial numbers on the partial storage bin account are then automatically adjusted. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_serinumber" with the name "Serial numbers - Processes" regarding Serial number guided parts without stock guide: In addition to the "normal" serial number managed parts, where the complete logistics chain is documented and the batches in the warehouse are managed separately, there is also the possibility of creating serial number managed parts, where the serial number is only recorded once at the time of removal from stock. The document history then shows which serial number has been used in which orders. Serial number-managed parts without stock management are defined via the logistics account as serial number-managed parts "Only on removal from stock". When recording a removal from stock, the serial numbers must be indicated corresponding to the number of serial number-managed parts to be removed from stock, otherwise the removal from stock cannot be booked.

This is the description of the module "ccacbstr" with the name "Cost centre evaluation": Cost centres can be directly subordinated to other cost centres, the entire structure is called an organisation chart. This module displays for each node of the organisation chart the current costs and planned costs (with variance in %) of the selected posting period (period costs) and the cumulative costs and cumulative planned costs (with variance in %) from the beginning of the fiscal year belonging to the posting period up to the specified accrual period - or optionally up to the end of the corresponding fiscal year. A period range can also be specified as the current posting period, e.g. for a quarterly evaluation. Costs can be posted to cost centres via financial accounting, via cost/service postings and via goods storage or removal. When goods are put away or removed from storage, they are posted for withdrawals for or receipts from cost centres together with the allocation cost element for storage stored in the client. If several company codes are assigned to a client, the cost centre evaluation can be called up for individual or cumulative for several company codes at the same time. This module can be called up for all cost centres in general (Controlling) or only for users who are responsible for cost centres. In the latter case, this user can only call up the costs of his and the subordinate cost centres. However, the costs themselves are only displayed to a limited extent, as they are only those costs whose cost elements are public. Both the controlling department and the cost centre managers can delegate an evaluation for a specific cost centre to any user using the functionality of saved lists. Even in this case, the evaluation can only be run to a limited extent for the cost centre (and its subordinate cost centres) once it has been transferred, it corresponds to the usage rights of a cost centre manager.

This is the description of the module "attrnode" with the name "Attribute node": Attribute nodes allow the gradual and conditional expression of attributes. This is particularly useful in product configuration (the specification of variant parts), but can also be useful when entering any form (document) or master data. This is the description of the functionality of the module "attrnode" with the name "Attribute node" regarding Application example for the gradual development: An application example for the gradual development of attributes is the division of a complex table of values of an attribute. Let us assume there is an attribute "MATERIAL". Behind this attribute there is a very large selection of different materials (various types of steel, aluminium and plastic as well as numerous alloys). This table can become very long, so it could take longer to select the right material. As a solution to this problem, the attribute "MATERIAL" can be created several times and the result table can be restricted in each case. So mine could create an attribute for steel, aluminium etc. and offer only the corresponding selection options as a result table. In addition you would have to create a new attribute "MATERIAL_ART" with the selection table: steel, aluminium, plastic and alloys. Behind this attribute, an attribute node is stored, which refers to the corresponding attribute "MATERIAL" depending on the set value. For example, in the sales item, the attribute "MATERIAL_ART" is then inserted instead of the complex table "MATERIAL". In the order, one then first selects "MATERIAL_ART". The corresponding attribute "MATERIAL" is then automatically added and in the second stage this value can then be set. This is the description of the functionality of the module "attrnode" with the name "Attribute node" regarding Application example for the conditional gradual characteristic: The conditional characteristic behaves similarly to the application example mentioned above, but is a little more complex. In the first example, the expression of one attribute led to other attributes with the same name with filtered result tables. However, an extensive product configuration can also be carried out via the attribute nodes. Let us imagine the configuration of a car. A car can be defined by many parameters. However, these parameters can be strongly interdependent. For example, after selecting 2- or 4-door, the question of rear electric windows may be obsolete. The same applies if one of the parameters is selected as the series and various extras are then already included. This type of multi-level conditional configuration is also possible via the attribute nodes.

By means of the context menu (right mouse button) in the list windows or by drag and drop the selection can be further selected to orders, cost centres, workstations, work groups and work areas. The list is recreated directly after the selection. This is the description of the functionality of the module "analypdc" with the name "BDE analysis" regarding Result:: As a result, the lists within the tabs on the mask below the evaluation periods are filled. Here are statistical subtotals which, depending on the tab, contain either reasons for deviation, resource or cost centre evaluations. The deviations are always shown in 3 columns: 1. hours in format SS:MM 2. minutes 3. percent Minutes has been added to the list so that you can also sort by them. Sorting according to the hour display is not possible, because it is a plain text field and in this case 21 would come before 3, because sorting starts with the first character from the left - as usual with alphabetical text sorting. If an entry of these lists is marked, all associated SFDC data acquisition will appear in the lower list. A multiple selection is also possible. If a PDC recording has a supplementary comment on the overtime or undertime, this can be viewed in its completeness by clicking on the toolbar button " " can be viewed and changed. A double click opens the editing mask of the PDC document. The target time in the lower list results from the following calculation: Logged off quantity * piece time + set-up time. So if only one of 10 pieces is logged off, the SET time is not displayed for the full 10 pieces. Example: Work sequence 010 has 10 hose connections, a piece time of 10 minutes and a set-up time of 5 minutes. If 2 pieces are now logged off, this results in a SET time of 25 minutes (2*10 minutes + 5 minutes set-up time). This is the description of the functionality of the module "analypdc" with the name "BDE analysis" regarding Option window: In the option window the BDE notes to be evaluated can be limited and filtered. The limitation can be specified for excess and shortfall quantities for BDE notes with and without deviation reason. This is very practical, as you can set that you are already interested in the receipts with a deviation of + 10% working time, but only those that were not justified. The receipts with reasons are only interesting from a deviation of e.g. 100%. You can also filter the negative deviation separately for all cases. Documents which have SOLL=ACTUAL can be ignored by unchecking the box "Display documents without deviation". However, this function is only available if no other filter is set, since then the documents without deviation are below the set limit anyway. This is the description of the functionality of the module "analypdc" with the name "BDE analysis" regarding Technical documentation: The evaluation is still done by collecting the information.

This is the description of the module "costmobj" with the name "Marketing cost unit (sales opportunity)": Along with cost types and cost centres, cost objects are part of cost accounting. However, the term cost object is also used synonymously - depending on the field - with the term project (order processing), the term framework agreement (purchasing) and the term internal cost object (e.g. R&D). A cost object thus describes a business object to which a wide variety of inventory objects and a wide variety of documents can be assigned. Within the marketing or sales acquisition process, marketing cost objects or sales opportunities form the second stage after the assignment of an interested party object or lead. The documents assigned to a cost object, i.e. the documents posted with a cost object can also contain costs/services. Thus, costs/services can be assigned to a cost object either directly via financial accounting or via special (cost) documents (e.g. time sheets). Inventory data of a plant (industrial plant, machine, part (e.g. for development projects)) and/or a business partner(prospective customer, customer, operator) or an operative partner(prospective customer, operator) can be assigned to the cost units themselves. Transaction data such as offers or orders can also be assigned to the cost units. Here, a "project" is thus the superordinate node for various offer or order documents. Usually at the beginning of a quotation processing there is the definition of a project, with specification of the external and internal project manager, the assignment to a plant and possibly also the determination of a first rough cost framework(order/sales planning) and a time schedule(network), which can be imported directly from a planning by means of MS-Projects and can also be reconciled with it. Therefore, offers can be created directly from a marketing cost object via certain buttons on the toolbar. In order to assign a marketing cost object to an order, the marketing cost object must first be converted into a sales cost object. This is the description of the functionality of the module "costmobj" with the name "Marketing cost unit (sales opportunity)" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain cost units. You can select a cost unit by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search".

This is the description of the module "resoljob" with the name "Resolved (production) work plan": This module is used to process order-specific production work plans. These are the routings which are generated by the system by exploding master routings taking into account the characteristics and their values specified from a production order. The term "exploding" refers to the search for entries from, for example, variant routing items or the calculation of times and/or characteristic values. Normally, ClassiX® assumes that at least a "rough" variant work plan is defined for each part in the system. This avoids having to define and enter a separate master routing for each special case in advance. Within the scope of detailed control and planning, this order-specific production routing is then adapted or designed more precisely in terms of workstations and times. The changes are then only valid for this production order item. Basically, however, one is also able to completely redefine the order-specific production work plan. This is the description of the functionality of the module "resoljob" with the name "Resolved (production) work plan" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select exploded production routings. This is the description of the functionality of the module "resoljob" with the name "Resolved (production) work plan" regarding Booking window: In this window all bookings of the selected sequence of operations are displayed.

This is the description of the module "print" with the name "Print mask": The functionality of this module ranges from the printing of receipts to the creation of serial e-mails and archiving files. This is the description of the functionality of the module "print" with the name "Print mask" regarding Single print vs. serial print: The simplest version of output is the output of a single document. For this purpose, the print window is called up via the editing mask of the document. The name of the print window usually contains the number and the name of the document. It is important for the individual print out that the type of correspondence address (street, e-mail or fax address) does not control the type of output but the user. Depending on which button (Preview, Print, Email, Fax, Save) is used to start printing, the type of output is determined. The serial print can be started in two different ways. On the one hand, the documents to be printed can be selected via a specially provided selection window "Activities -> Print", on the other hand, the documents can be transferred to the print module via the respective list window. The window name indicates how many receipts are to be printed. In some cases, the window name also indicates how many receipts are to be output as fax, email or paper. In mail merge, the output is controlled by the correspondence address of the voucher. If an email address was selected here, the document is automatically sent as an email. If you want to have a look at the preview before the correct print, this is normally possible with single print. With mail merge, only the preview of one of the documents to be printed is displayed. If an email is generated in single print, it is not sent automatically, but the generated email is opened in Outlook. The user can once again skim the generated email and then send it as a normal email generated in Outlook itself. In mail merge, however, the emails are sent directly. If you want to check the content of the mails again afterwards, you can do this via the folder 'sent objects' in Outlook. This is the description of the functionality of the module "print" with the name "Print mask" regarding Archiving: The presetting of archiving takes place in the document and is thus also defined/preset depending on the document. Archiving can be switched off (standard) or only registration can take place. In the latter case, the system only remembers when and by which employee a document was printed. If archiving is switched on, you can specify whether a Word or PDF document is to be generated as an archive document and whether this document is to be stored in a directory. The latter is recommended, as otherwise the database can become very large very quickly if no directory is defined and the documents are saved in the ClassiX database. When the print template is called up, the default settings are transferred to the archiving group, but can be changed here. If the resulting document is archived in a directory, the file name is derived from the document name, which is also displayed in the window title of the print mask, whereby all spaces are replaced by underscores. The file "Bestellung_004534.doc" is thus created from the order number 004534. If this file already exists because the document has been printed before, the file name is extended by a running index. In all cases, except when archiving is switched off, an output object is created which records the print date and the person responsible for the print. When archiving to a directory, this object also holds the path to the document, otherwise the document is held directly. The output object is displayed in the "Repeat" tab of the print mask. From here it can be opened or printed again. This is the description of the functionality of the module "print" with the name "Print mask" regarding Email dispatch via Outlook or SMTP: If a print document is sent by email, the type of sending can be selected in addition to the file format of the attachment - PDF or DOC. There are two options to choose from here. On the one hand the email can be sent via MS Outlook. ClassiX automatically creates and sends an e-mail in Outlook. In mass printing this happens in the background without the user noticing. The e-mail is treated by Outlook like a normal e-mail and can be found in the folder "Sent Objects". This allows the user to check, among other things, that the email was sent successfully. In single print mode the generated email is opened and can be sent by the user. Sendingemails via SMTP is a more direct way. The advantage is, on the one hand, that no Outlook installation is required and, on the other, that it brings performance advantages. The latter is especially advantageous for mass printing. As the e-mail is not sent via an Outlook account, either the e-mail address of the user registered in ClassiX or a free address is used. To the user's e-mail address the e-mail is also sent as blindcopy (bcc). This way the e-mail can be archived in Outlook if required and the arrival of the copy is considered as confirmation of successful sending. The prerequisite for using the SMTP service is that the name of the SMTP server has been specified in the "System" tab in the client.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "print" with the name "Print mask" regarding Sending a fax via Outlook or a fax driver: Faxes can be sent via a mail program - such as Outlook - or via a fax driver. The settings for which of these options can be used are made in the options. With the option"Output via mail programme The sending of the fax is taken over by the mail program from here on. With the option"Output via fax driver", the name of the fax driver must also be specified in the option window. The fax driver is addressed like a printer driver, the fax number must be encrypted in the printout - depending on the printer driver, for example, in the form of a document variable. When printing, the system searches for the fax driver in the list of printers and "prints" the generated document using this driver. The fax driver then takes over the transmission of the fax. This is the description of the functionality of the module "print" with the name "Print mask" regarding Default setting of the print document: The presetting of the print document is done in various ways. By default, the presetting of the document is controlled by the number and depends on the document type. For example, the document with the number "SAO" - if available - is always automatically selected when a job is to be printed. Interesting for the user is the selection of the standard document via the document presettings. Here, a document can be assigned to each document type, which is preset in the print mask when printing. This setting can be made for a client, a cost centre or even for a user individually. However, differentiation must also be made when determining the standard document via the document presettings. For example, a standard document is usually always determined via the type of objects to be printed. However, it is also possible to differentiate here via conditional document presettings. For example, the document can be set for the order depending on the order type. Important: If different documents are determined by different conditions during mass printing, the standard document determined via the number or the class is preset. This is the description of the functionality of the module "print" with the name "Print mask" regarding Print mask: The document and various properties of the print can be set via the print mask and thus the appearance of the output can be controlled. The type of output (printer, email, fax, file) is also defined here by the user. This is the description of the functionality of the module "print" with the name "Print mask" regarding Print Preview: After selecting a document, the print preview can be called up via the print mask. The created document is displayed in the print preview and can even be edited. However, these should only be cosmetic changes. Changes to the document data should also only be made via the respective editing screen of the document, as otherwise they are not traceable. Since it is also possible to print from the print preview, archiving processes can also be started here. This is the description of the functionality of the module "print" with the name "Print mask" regarding Selection window: You can search for documents to be printed via the selection window. In this way, for example, mass printing (e.g. all orders created today but not yet printed) can be started. This is the description of the functionality of the module "print" with the name "Print mask" regarding Documents not sent/printed: After a print operation, this window displays the documents that are associated with the document to be printed, but which could not be printed/sent automatically. The documents can be displayed via the "Open" button, thus initiating manual printing/sending. This window always appears when printing documents with associated documents, as these cannot be printed automatically. When sending by email, the documents are transferred as attachments. An example of documents associated with vouchers is procurement documents. This is the description of the functionality of the module "print" with the name "Print mask" regarding Order reminder: When calculating the open quantity, unit errors are ignored and no open quantity is printed for the item in question. This is the description of the functionality of the module "print" with the name "Print mask" regarding Activity document: In contrast to the output of other documents, the special feature of transaction documents is that it is not absolutely necessary to select a document. The interaction between the type of message text and the document selection is as follows: recommendation/conclusion: The presetting of the document is controlled via the document presettings just like the presetting of the message text. The following combinations are possible. If the message text of the transaction document has a header and/or footer, the presetting of the document by the document presettings does not apply. When creating an email, external documents are attached to the email. This is the description of the functionality of the module "print" with the name "Print mask" regarding Goods receipt: The additional documents selected in the list are output as subsequent pages and should consist of free blocks. This is the description of the functionality of the module "print" with the name "Print mask" regarding Convert MS Word .doc file to .pdf: This window is not used for advanced print output, but for converting Word documents located on the hard disk into PDF documents. Procedure. This is the description of the functionality of the module "print" with the name "Print mask" regarding Bank Clearing Accompanying note: The Bank Clearing Accompanying Note has no class of its own.

This is the description of the module "verifydb" with the name "Check database": With this module the database can be technically checked completely or in parts. Besides the connections of the objects among each other, the collections are also checked (call of the ObjectStore utility osverifydb). If no errors are detected, deleted objects can be permanently removed (reorganised) from the database in a second step. For this purpose 6 preparatory steps have to be taken before the database is internally reorganised with the ObjectStore utility oscompact and then created as a new copy with the ObjectStore utility oscopy. If a persistent object is deleted from a ClassiX application, it is first only logically deleted, i.e. a deletion identifier is assigned and the object is registered in a separate list (garbage collection). To permanently remove a persistent object from an object-oriented database it must be ensured that no other object references this deleted object. This check is carried out using the ObjectStore utility osgc, which marks all "unreachable" objects as deletable and thus releases them for removal. An object is considered "unreachable" if it is not referenced in the database by any other object or list. In order to make objects that have been logically deleted by a ClassiX application "unreachable", the following 6 steps have to be carried out: Since logically deleted objects can also reference other logically deleted objects, the connections between these objects are cut. Connections to non-deleted objects, on the other hand, are retained. For this purpose, all logically deleted objects from their registration list (garbage collection) are run through. Deleted" are those objects that either have a deletion identification or are contained in the deletion registration list (garbage collection). The addresses of the objects from which connections were cut - i.e. which were changed - are saved in a file. All logically deleted objects are removed from their registration list (garbage collection), the addresses of these objects are written to a file. Call of the ObjectStore utility osgc with output of the addresses of the "unreachable" objects into a file, i. e. this run does NOT remove any objects from the database. From the addresses from steps 2 and 3, a list of object addresses can now be determined which - although deleted - would not be removed from the database: For this purpose, the addresses that are considered "unreachable" (step 3) are removed from the addresses of all logically deleted objects (step 2). The resulting list contains only those addresses of logically deleted objects that must NOT and would NOT be removed from the database, i.e. which are still "actively" referenced by other objects in the database. This address list of logically deleted objects remaining in the database is compared with the addresses in the list from step 1: If addresses appear in both lists, connections have been cut, which must remain, otherwise a complete navigation from "active" objects would no longer be possible. These objects must be examined more closely: either the deletion is reversed, or the connection to the "active" database space is cut, or these objects are omitted in step 1. If such objects occur, it is not possible to proceed directly with the reorganisation of the database. After checking the situation and reacting accordingly, step 1 must be restarted. If such objects do not occur, the actual removal of the objects from the database can be continued with step 5. Call the ObjectStore utility osgc again, but this time WITH removal of "unreachable" objects from the database. Using the address list from step 2, the logically deleted objects still remaining in the database are registered again, i.e. entered in the garbage collection. If all these steps are called up in one go, it is checked whether the newly created garbage collection matches the list of remaining objects from step 4. Also for these remaining objects, it should be checked why references from "active" objects still exist. Up to this point, objects were initially only deleted from the database. A reorganisation of the data in the database and thus a possible reduction in the size of the database is only achieved by successively calling the ObjectStore utilities oscompact and oscopy. Attention Dictionaries must be rebuilt after the run {CODE( wrap="1")}[ CX_OBJECT_DICTIONARY CX_OBJECT_DICTIONARY_CI CX_OBJECT_DICTIONARY_ML CX_OBJECT_DICTIONARY_ML_CI ] iterate { FindAll(STACK) iterate { Call(RebuildDictionary) } } {CODE}. This is the description of the functionality of the module "verifydb" with the name "Check database" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select the segments to be checked. The directory in which the logbooks are to be stored must also be selected. The check starts with "Start". This is the description of the functionality of the module "verifydb" with the name "Check database" regarding Technical documentation: ClassiX® does not check the segments itself, but calls for each segment the batch file verifydb.bat, which is located in the project directory. This file delegates the work to osverifydb, an ObjectStore utility.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_localeReference" with the name "Operations calendar" regarding Setting the operating calendars for different production areas: First the locales must be persistently transferred to the database in order to be able to set different operating calendars Then you have to consider how many different company calendars there must be, so maybe one for the GmbH, one for production in general, and one for the production areas that also have to work when the others have time off. Unfortunately, no returns for public holidays are possible yet, so a separate operating calendar must be recorded for each production centre that has public holidays that differ from others. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_localeReference" with the name "Operations calendar" regarding Edit operations calendar: The operating calendars are created by someone who has the rights to change the location-specific data in the Object-Inspector. Here, the new operating calendars are created below the federal state in which the company has its headquarters, without additional entries. Afterwards, the operating calendar to be edited can be set via the main menu "User → Set Locale". If the operating calendar to be edited is now set, editing can be started via the main menu "System → Calendars → Operating calendar". In the processing list, all public holidays are listed, including those which do not come directly from this operating calendar but are defined in higher-level operating calendars and thus inherited into the current operating calendar. These entries cannot be changed by the user. All entries added by the user appear in red letters. They can be edited and deleted. The "New" button is used to create a new entry, which can be a single day or a time period. Please note that the time span must not extend from one year to the next. After entering the date and, if necessary, the end date for time periods, the new operating calendar entry is saved with OK. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_localeReference" with the name "Operations calendar" regarding Assigning the operating calendar to production areas and / or workstations: In order for the added calendars to come into effect and have effects, they must still be assigned to the production areas or directly to the workstations. This is done quite simply on the corresponding processing mask. There are "Locale" buttons with which the locale selection tree is opened. The entry selected here is dragged into the editing mask and must be saved there by pressing the OK button. That's it already. When scheduling the work sequences, this operating calendar is now taken into account.
Sure! Based on the given module description, here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask:

1. How do I transfer locales to the database in the "Operations calendar" module?

This is the description of the module "cxItemCostEstimate" with the name "Parts preliminary calculation": Capture of characteristics (optional) Recording cost rates (optional) Select part(s) Calculate Error log Edit Resolved Resources (optional) Transferring the calculation values into the master data Possibly new calculation with changed settings This module is used for the pre-calculation of parts from the parts master. The main screen - from which the preliminary costing is carried out - has three windows/cards: the card with the list of parts to be calculated (parts), a card with attributes (attributes) and a card with cost rates (cost rates). The general procedure of a parts pre-calculation is the following: 0a. Capture physical characteristics (optional) Since a preliminary cost estimate can also be made using variant parts, you can store characteristic values in the Characteristics window in advance: this prevents the interactive query of characteristics during the explosion of the BOMs and routings. This is one way of storing characteristic values. Another is that each preliminary cost estimate can have its own characteristic values, which is described below. Characteristic features can be transferred from the master data (part + production role) by clicking on the "Transfer" button above the list of characteristic features. 0b. Recording cost rates (optional) The cost rates in the form of overhead rates for materials, wages, sales and administration are copied by default from the corresponding deposits with the client into the Cost Rates window. These values can be overwritten here. Here, too, each preliminary calculation saves the cost rates for itself and these can be overwritten there. This is also explained in more detail below. 1. select part(s) Here you have the choice between a simple selection by number/text, etc. or via further more complex search criteria, such as warehouse, logistics indicator, etc.". Only parts that have a production role can be selected for a preliminary costing: the parts list and the routing of a part are defined in the production role. A new preliminary cost estimate is automatically created for each newly selected part. This preliminary cost estimate is given its own number and is stored with the production role of the part. Any existing characteristics from the Characteristics window and the cost rates from the Cost Rates window are also copied into the preliminary cost estimate. In addition, you can insert or change characteristics manually, for example, if none have been specified in the main window or if they are insufficient. Just as in the main window, there are two ways of inserting here: A lot size is also copied into the preliminary calculation: This depends on the "Lot size" option, according to which the lot size is copied from the production roll or from a manual specification. It is also possible to draw results of the sales item turnover statistics into the parts pre-calculation list. In the sales article sales statistics, it is possible, for example, to display all spare parts with a positive sales volume in the current statistics period and to start the preliminary calculation for these parts only. 2. calculate The (or all) parts selected in the list can then be pre-calculated. You can choose between a calculation according to standard values (only the characteristics and cost rates from the pre-calculation windows are taken into account) or an individual calculation: the values from the saved pre-calculation are taken. If neither the values in the preliminary costing nor the values in the windows have been changed after selecting a part, both procedures are of course identical. During costing, the parts list(s) and routings are exploded according to the specifications under Option/Stage. The respective status of an explosion is displayed in the status line of the precalculation window. At the end of a cost estimate, the new values for material and labour (per lot size) and thus the manufacturing costs (per 1 unit) are displayed. 3. error log Possible errors in the explosion of the bills of material and routings, as well as missing valuations, lead to an incorrect preliminary costing. An error log can therefore optionally be output on the screen or written to a file. The following error causes are checked: If a preliminary cost estimate has one or more errors, this data cannot be transferred to the production role of the part as new production costs. 4. edit resolved resources (optional) The resulting bill of material and the exploded routing can be viewed. On the one hand as a structure tree, on the other hand in a tabular form with exact display of the costs and overhead rates. 5. transfer the costing values to the master data. The new(error-free) preliminary costing values are transferred with date to the production role of the part. 6. possibly new costing with changed settings. So that you do not have to fill in a complete preliminary part costing again, for example, inserting material characteristics again and defining them accordingly, possibly even inserting the cost rates or documents, you can copy an already existing preliminary part costing from the list window. This can be done either via the main menu of the list window or via the context menu in the list. The description, lot size, characteristics including features, cost rates and documents (no conditional ones) are copied. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemCostEstimate" with the name "Parts preliminary calculation" regarding List window: On the 'Parts' card, the preliminary costings that are currently being processed are listed. On the 'Characteristics' card of the part costing, you can insert or delete the characteristics which are necessary for exploding the BOMs and routings. The global cost rates from the client are displayed on the 'Cost rates' card and can be changed locally. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxItemCostEstimate" with the name "Parts preliminary calculation" regarding Option window: Each time the main list window is opened, the options described here are reset to the default settings.

This is the description of the module "finpcacc" with the name "Change control account": Personal accounts, i.e. customers, suppliers, employees and commission recipients (representatives) form so-called sub-ledgers in financial accounting. The connection to the general ledger of the financial accounting and thus to the balance sheet accounts of the classes receivables and payables are determined in CyberEnterprise® from the partner functions via the field reconciliation account. Normally, such an allocation to the control account remains unchanged, but if, for example, a previous supplier is bought by the own company, the control account must be changed from "trade payables" to "payables to affiliated companies" from this specific date. Another example is when a country is admitted to the European Union, then the reconciliation accounts of the person holding accounts from this country could change from e.g. "Foreign receivables" to "EU receivables". The totals and balance lists of debtors, creditors, employees and commission recipients (representatives) can also be called up via the respective reconciliation account, at the same time checking whether the balance of the reconciliation account matches the total of the person accounts assigned to the reconciliation account.This app is used, on the one hand, to make such a change to a reconciliation account of a person holding account, and, on the other hand, to make a posting - otherwise not permitted - between reconciliation accounts. This is the description of the functionality of the module "finpcacc" with the name "Change control account" regarding Input window: This window is used to change the control account of a sub-account and to compile the data for a transfer between control accounts.

This is the description of the module "purchaseRequisition" with the name "Requirement request": The purchasing department is prompted by the requisitions to trigger orders. Every employee in the company can create requirement coverage requests. A distinction is made between four types:Own consumptionInvestmentOrder requirementsStorage needsProject needsPersonal use (consumables or capital goods) must be approved by a supervisor. Order and warehouse requirements are automatically approved if the "Approval" checkbox is not selected.Attention! Goods ordered for a cost centre via "own requirements" are NOT put into storage after the goods receipt has been made available! It can also NOT be subsequently linked to an order!The quantity of goods provided by the incoming goods department does not increase the stock, but is intended for goods consumed by the corresponding cost centre (office supplies such as pens, printer paper, swivel chairs)! Thus the procurement process of the goods is finished after the provision of the goods receipt!In order to have a requisition approved by a superior or to forward it directly to the purchasing department, it must be posted. The posting cannot take place automatically, as otherwise the approver/purchaser would receive the requirement coverage request before it has been checked by the processor.It is also important to note that requirement coverage requests of the type internal requirements can only be posted if a cost centre has been specified there for which the internal requirements are requested. A requirement coverage request of the type customer requirement must have a predecessor, that is, a cost object, in order to describe it completely.Another special feature must be taken into account in any case: quantities ordered for own use, i.e. for a specific cost centre, are not displayed on the warehouse account in the total "In Goods Receipt" or "In QA" after a goods receipt, as this ordered quantity is not intended for general "dispositive" consumption but only for the specified cost centre!. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchaseRequisition" with the name "Requirement request" regarding Input window: This window is used for maintaining requirement coverage requests. You can select a requisition by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". After you have selected the processor and the approver, if not specified, the system assigns a requirement request number by confirming with 'OK' and the ' Requirement request item' window opens, in which you can now individually insert your items to be ordered by the purchasing department. When you have entered all positions, close the position window. You return to the 'Requirement request' window, in which all items are listed. By clicking on 'Book', the status of the requirement request is set to "Requirement request to be approved" and placed in the approver's activity folder. New requisitions must be posted to trigger an operation. If you close the window without posting, the error message "ATTENTION: requirement request has not yet been posted" appears. Once a requisition has been posted, it can no longer be changed (error message: "requisition has already been posted"). Deletion of the requirement coverage request items is only permitted if the requirement coverage request has not yet been approved and if no follow-on documents (purchase orders, purchase requisitions, ) have been generated, since the requester must first coordinate with the relevant employees (e.g. orders may have to be cancelled). This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchaseRequisition" with the name "Requirement request" regarding Authorisation procedure Requirement request: A description of the approval procedure can be found in the purchasing transaction process. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchaseRequisition" with the name "Requirement request" regarding Own supplies: If a requirement coverage request is to be used to plan an internal provision at level 0 of a sales order, an internal provision document must be created for this requirement coverage request item. This is possible via the requirement coverage request item directly via the toolbar button possible. The part, delivery date, quantity and description are transferred.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_textitem" with the name "Text article" regarding Description/Definition: In addition to the normal sales articles, spare parts and service units, there are other types of parts in order to enter an order. Here, the text articles are in constant competition with the unspecified variant parts. The text articles represent the typical disposable article, which is really only sold rarely and/or only once. In contrast, the unspecified variant part can only be precisely defined in the order, but is nevertheless often sold in a similar form. For example, an unspecified variant part could be a PC with a purchasing role to determine a main supplier. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_textitem" with the name "Text article" regarding Capture of text articles: The entry of text article items in the order or quotation begins like the entry of each item via Insert - Item - "corresponding type". The difference is that no article is inserted. If you now save the item, a text article is automatically created. In addition, the field in which the article is normally displayed is replaced by a field for entering a short term. Since no master information is available for the text article, the information of the order item must now be entered manually. Apart from the price, one of the most important factors here is the article description, since otherwise the item will appear largely empty in the press proof and no one will know which article it is in the further processing. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_textitem" with the name "Text article" regarding Technical approval/further processing: -.
Sure! Based on the given module description, here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "Text article" module:

1. What is the purpose of the "Text article" module in SAP?
2. How do I create a new text article item in the order or quotation?
3. Can I insert a text article item without creating a new one?
4. How do I capture the article description for a text article item?
5. Is there a way to automate the capturing of the article description for text article items?
6. Can I add multiple text article items to an order or quotation?
7. How do I distinguish between text article items and other types of items in the order or quotation?
8. Are there any specific fields or characteristics that define a text article item?
9. Can I modify the fields or characteristics of a text article item after it has been created?
10. How do I delete a text article item if it is no longer needed?

I hope these questions cover all aspects of the "Text article" module and provide a good starting point for understanding its functionality!

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_chargen" with the name "Batch management" regarding Creating a batch managed part: Batch managed parts must be created as variant parts. The batch number ( attribute _batchNumber) must then be defined as a characteristic of the variant part. For the individual batches, subparts are generated in which the batch numbers are marked. The subparts always have the same part number as the variant part. They also have the special feature that they are not listed in the part search. You always select the variant part first, then a separate selection mask opens for selecting the batch. Using the _dateOfExpiry attribute in the characteristics bar, you can also control whether the expiry dateof the parts is relevant. If this attribute is taken over as type characteristic, the entry of this date is mandatory when creating new batches, otherwise the entry of the expiry date is optional. In the variant part, it is necessary to select the option"Shared Dispatching Account", if necessary, this option must first be activated via the client. A common MRP account is necessary because the stock is to be ensured across all batches. The check mark "Common stock account" must NOT be set, because the stock postings may only be made via the lower parts. As a rule, batch-managed parts are stock parts and therefore have to be marked accordingly in the logistics account. In the logistics account in the group warehouse account it can be defined per option according to which criteria the stock removal should be carried out during the automatic creation (creation of a stock removal from the staging list warehouse). The option Fifo (first in first out) is preset, so that the batches that were put away first are also the batches that are removed first. The date on which the batches were created is taken into account. Alternatively, for batch-managed parts which have the attribute for the expiry date, an option can be set, according to which the batches which expire first are also those which are removed from stock first. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_chargen" with the name "Batch management" regarding Batch-guided parts without bearing guide: In addition to the "normal" batch-managed parts, where the complete logistics chain is documented and the batches in the warehouse are managed separately, it is also possible to create batch-managed parts, where the batch is only recorded once at the time of removal from storage. The document history then shows which batch numbers have been used in which orders. Batch managed parts without stock management are created as individual parts. The material characteristic of the batch number (_batchNumber) is therefore not required. Instead, the part is defined in the logistics account as a batch-managed part "Only for stock removal". When entering a removal from storage, the batch number must be indicated, otherwise the removal from storage cannot be posted. Several stock removal items of the same part must be created if parts of different batches are removed from stock. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_chargen" with the name "Batch management" regarding The procurement of a batch-managed part: With the option "joint MRP account", only the variant part appears in the requirements and stock list, for example, if the minimum stock level has not been reached. In the case of an order part, the requirement request or directly the order can now be created. At this point in the procurement process, the attribute of the batch number is no longer required, as the batch number is only known at the time of delivery. The first step when receiving the delivery should be to create the subpart(s) according to the delivered batches, as this is currently not yet done automatically by the goods receipt. Afterwards the goods receipt can be recorded. By selecting the order, the variant part is still drawn into the goods receipt in the first step, but the batch number can now be entered via the item. If the entered batch number leads to a lower part, this replaces the variant part in the item. This means that the lower part is addressed during the subsequent putaway. The batch number must be entered at goods receipt!.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions referencing the module description for "Batch management" in the "processes_chargen" module:

1. How do I create a batch-managed part in SAP?
2. What is the purpose of defining a batch number as a characteristic of a variant part in SAP?

9. How do I receive a delivery of a batch-managed part in SAP?
10. How do I enter the batch number when recording a goods receipt for a batch-managed part in SAP?

I hope these questions cover the key aspects of the module description for "Batch management" in the "processes_chargen" module!

This is the description of the module "qm_timedTrigger_qm" with the name "Time Trigger (CX_TIMED_TRIGGER)": For various time and date forms, the transmission of messages of a CX_TIMED_TRIGGER object can be test/checked.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "qm_timedTrigger_qm" module based on its description:

1. What types of time and date forms can be used with the Time Trigger (CX_TIMED_TRIGGER) module?

This is the description of the module "proorder" with the name "Construction contract": This module is used to maintain production orders. The items of a production order determine with quantity and date all the parts that are to be produced in the company itself. In general, production orders with their positions are automatically generated from the parts request. Thereby only one production order (a collective order) is generated from a parts request (with the exception of latecomers), whose positions then define the parts to be produced. (After releasing a parts request, you automatically branch to the processing mask of the generated production orders).New production order items can also be opened manually (i.e. production order items without a predecessor), in which case the input option for assignment to a cost centre opens automatically.A work plan must always be defined for each individual production order item. This is generally generated production-specific from the master routing(Explode routing). In the same step the respective start and end times of each work sequence are determined by means of backward scheduling, taking into account the controlled throughput times. The automatically determined end dates as well as the lead times can be manually adjusted for each individual work sequence. This is the description of the functionality of the module "proorder" with the name "Construction contract" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain production orders. You can select a production order by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". The items of a production order are displayed in the lower list window. You can revise these production order items by double-clicking them in the window 'Production order items'. With the right mouse button it is possible to switch to the routings and revise them. This is the description of the functionality of the module "proorder" with the name "Construction contract" regarding Change of dates: The dates of production orders that have already been fully booked and possibly already started and even partially completed can be changed subsequently via the menu Edit/End dates. This is the description of the functionality of the module "proorder" with the name "Construction contract" regarding Changes to the production work plan after posting the work times: If a routing is to be changed after the production order has been released, an individual item can be booked out, changed and booked in again by using the context menu (right mouse button on selected item in the item list), menu item "Item - Book out". While the position is booked out, it remains in the status "Stopped". It is now possible to make changes to the work plan. After successfully changing a task list or creating a new task list, the item can participate in the business process again. The work times must now be booked in again, which returns the status of the item from "Stopped" to its original status. To change the work plan, only the item needs to be booked out and opened as described above. Afterwards new work sequences can be added or deleted on the tab "Work plan". By double-clicking, you can directly access the editing mask of the work sequence, on which its data can then be changed. Using the arrow keys next to the list, the sequence of operations can be changed as required. The list is not sorted. However, it is only possible to change the routing of a production order item as long as it has not been staged: the staged quantity is then already written to the triggering requirement. If you want to remove work sequences for which PDC confirmations have already taken place, you can either set these work sequences to "completed" with a possible remaining time that has not yet been reported, or you can change the status of the work sequence directly from the worklist to "completed". If, after processing, the total time of all work sequences of a production order item is longer or shorter than planned in parts scheduling, the production order item (or the work centre times) cannot be posted because the throughput times on the production order and parts request differ. In order to correct this it is possible to mark in the parts request the parts request item belonging to the changed production order item and to transfer the lead time resulting from the sum of the work sequences to the parts request item via the menu "Edit - MRP - Determine procurement time - Set selected - Dynamic". Due to the now changed throughput time of one production order item, a gap in the workflow across all production order items is created. For this reason, the scheduling of the entire parts requirement must now be rescheduled with the new throughput times. For this purpose the scheduling type "rescheduling" must be selected. Already scheduled items are not affected by this rescheduling. After rescheduling, the parts request can then be released and the work times can be booked back into the production order. Via the menu "Edit - Check - Changed dates" it can be checked after rescheduling whether the rescheduling had effects on subsequent documents such as further production order items or requirement coverage requests. All Explained in keywords, the change in the work sequences looks like this:.

Please note that these questions are just examples and may not cover every aspect of the module's functionality.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "proorder" with the name "Construction contract" regarding Graphical scheduling of work plan positions: It is also possible to change the dates of work sequences in the graphical scheduling of the part request. The work plan does not need to be booked out (it is not possible to delete or add work sequences, only to change the lead time or the start and end dates). Graphical scheduling can be called up via the menu item "Edit - Capacity - Graphical scheduling". Whether there is sufficient capacity for the exploded routings can be checked via the menu item "Edit - Capacity - Capacity check of all / selected items". If all routings are to be checked, no item or all items must first be selected. More information about graphical scheduling and capacity check See also calendar of operations Subsequent changes to parts list items below production order items After changing a bill of material item which is located below a parts request item to be produced, the production order item receives an indicator (date) that the papers must be reprinted. This date can be seen in the production order processing mask in the penultimate column and in the worklist in the 2nd column. It disappears again after "real" printing of the production papers. For the further procedure when subsequently changing parts list items, see here. This is the description of the functionality of the module "proorder" with the name "Construction contract" regarding List window: Used to list the production orders. This is the description of the functionality of the module "proorder" with the name "Construction contract" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select a production order. This is the description of the functionality of the module "proorder" with the name "Construction contract" regarding Progress of work: This window is used to display the work progress of a production order. The "Error" column indicates as a number (bit pattern) the error code when data is transmitted from the PDA: // bit 0 = 1: multiple start events on the same day // bit 1 = 2: start event after end event // bit 2 = 4: Pause message after multiple starts (automatic break event with multiple starts) // bit 3 = 8: Pause message without start message (break/end event without start event) // bit 4 = 16: unknown BDE message (wrong event) // bit 5 = 32: multiple end events. This is the description of the functionality of the module "proorder" with the name "Construction contract" regarding Option window: Each time the production order window is opened, the options described here are reset to the default settings. This is the description of the functionality of the module "proorder" with the name "Construction contract" regarding External work sequences Assistant: Using the assistant of the external work sequences, total quantities can be automatically assigned for the selected items, from which orders and own supplies of the superordinate parts can be created. Sequence description of external work sequences which are processed via the assistant:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "proorder" with the name "Construction contract" regarding Printed production order items: This window is used to search for production order items printed today (or on another date that can be set). From this list, the withdrawals for all marked orders can be generated in summary form and the material accompanying sheets of the production orders can be printed. This evaluation list is opened by the warehouse every day to see which warehouse reservations need to be made, without the need for production to run to the warehouse with a production paper to tell people which order is to be produced now. This is the description of the functionality of the module "proorder" with the name "Construction contract" regarding Technical provision:: If a production order is provided, the production order is connected with all its parts list predecessors via the connection transfered.predecessors/transfered.successors. This is necessary so that individual parts list items can also be provided, for example, if several predecessors have been combined in a parts request and now only a single order item is to be provided. If the macro PROVIDE_PRODUCTION_ORDER_ITEM is called up with a BOM item, only the quantity of the BOM item is marked as staged, and only this quantity is allocated to ONLY the direct order predecessor (if available) as a staged quantity.

This is the description of the module "purchaseRequisitionLoggingsList" with the name "Approved requisition": A distinction is made between four types of requisition request: Consumables (own use) Capital goods (own consumption) Customer requirements (e.g. orders) Storage needs Personal use (consumables or capital goods) must be approved by a supervisor. Customer and warehouse requirements are automatically approved if the "Approval" checkbox is not selected. The approved requisitions are automatically distributed to the individual purchasing staff members, since each purchase order item has been assigned to a purchasing area ("Purchasing area" field in the purchase order item window) and the purchasing areas have been assigned to the purchasing staff members(structure PURCHASING_GROUPS "Purchasing areas"). This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchaseRequisitionLoggingsList" with the name "Approved requisition" regarding Functionality: The user automatically sees the requirements of his purchasing areas to be ordered, but can also access the purchasing folders of other clerks. The documents that are displayed are located in the activity folder of the corresponding user in the subfolder "Requirement request item" / "Requirement request item approved". Select the responsible agent. All approved purchase requisitions open. To trigger the purchase order, you must select the item that is to be ordered. Via 'Enter new purchase order' or via 'Edit - Purchase order - Enter new purchase order' the system automatically assigns a consecutive order number and you reach the window 'Purchase order item ', which consists of the requirement item. You can now revise this item, e.g. insert prices or change the order text etc. With 'OK' you save the item and with 'Close' you reach the window 'Order'. The approved requisition window has the following functions: The functions are always executed on all selected list items. If you want to create a new purchase order, for example, you must first select the requirement items and then either press the button Press or call up the menu item "Edit -> Purchase order -> Enter new purchase order". Before entering a new or extending an existing (open) order, appropriate security questions are asked. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchaseRequisitionLoggingsList" with the name "Approved requisition" regarding Purity: Purity means the following and is explained here using the example of supplier purity: Parts A, B and C are marked in the list of approved requisitions. Part A and B have the same main supplier, part C has a different one. First of all, an order for part A is created, which is extended by that for part B. Now the system notices that part C has a different main supplier and opens a new order. The same is true when extending orders, which can be opened in the background behind the list of approved requirement requests. It is checked whether the supplier on the purchase orders open in the background is the same as the main supplier of the part to be extended. Each project can contain various other purities (requester, project, delivery address) This purity can be switched off via the menu: Edit->Orders->Expand order (forced/no purity). In the module, all other requisition items can actually also be displayed (which are posted in other subfolders of the "requisition item" folders). Via the menu item "Status selection", another status (default always "Approved") can be selected for this, e.g. "Partially ordered". The latter status is also very important, as the only partially ordered requisitions still appear in the respective MRP accounts, but no longer in the list of (only) approved requisitions. In such a view, the list can be filtered with the right mouse button or via the menu item Edit-> Display filter, if possible, as follows: The window title shows which status (in round brackets) and which filter (in square brackets) is currently selected (e.g. "Requirement request items (approved) [[all]"). In the list, a column refers to certain special situations. These are: - Unit error between requisition and purchase order items, - erroneous totals, - existing purchase orders but cancelled. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purchaseRequisitionLoggingsList" with the name "Approved requisition" regarding Class: -.
Sure! Based on the given module description, here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask:

1. How do I access the approved requisition list in the "purchaseRequisitionLoggingsList" module?

3. What is the purpose of the "Purify" function in the approved requisition list, and how does it work?
4. How do I create a new purchase order from an approved requisition item in the list?
5. Can I edit the prices or order text for a purchase order item before saving it?
6. Are there any security questions that I need to answer before creating or editing a purchase order?
7. How do I distinguish between parts A, B, and C in the approved requisition list, since they have the same main supplier?
8. Can I extend an existing order for part A and B together, and how does the system handle the different main supplier for part C?
9. Is there a way to display all other requisition items that are posted in other subfolders of the "requisition item" folders?
10. How do I switch off the purity feature for a particular project or delivery address in the module?

This is the description of the module "stockWithdrawal" with the name "Outsourcing": Goods withdrawal or provision (warehouse)The goods withdrawal documents count up a consumption value "consumed.quantity" in the warehouse statistics if the following condition is met:Source warehouse is the warehouse of the main client and warehouse is dispositive (check mark "no disposition" is NOT set)This quantity (consumed.quantity) is used for the safety stock calculation (spare parts business). This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockWithdrawal" with the name "Outsourcing" regarding Input window: This window is used for the maintenance of removals. You can select a stock removal by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". You can create a new page out by pressing the OK button. Number, date and employee are automatically initialised. With the button 'Insert' you can now create positions. The window of the part master opens, from which you can select the part to be removed and transfer it to the window 'Removal from stock' by double-clicking. The data from the parts master are also transferred to the window. Enter the quantity actually withdrawn in the 'Quantity' field. With the button 'Insert' you can assign the part to an order by selecting the corresponding position via the order number and dragging it into the field. With the button 'Remove' you can delete these positions at any time. With 'OK' you save your data and with the 'Close' button you return to the window 'Outsourcing'. You can now create further items or complete the document with the 'Book' button. In this case the removal from storage is posted to the warehouse account and the current stock is recalculated. If, after posting, you notice that you have posted, you can call up the corresponding document again and change the quantity to zero at any time via the menu item 'Edit - Set quantities in selected items to zero' or directly in the item to the correct quantity and post again. The stock level will then be recalculated. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockWithdrawal" with the name "Outsourcing" regarding Alternative part/quantity: If a check mark is placed in the field"Alternative part / quantity", a requirement can be provided with a different part and a different quantity. By activating the check mark " Completely provided" you can completely provide the predecessor documents of the retrieval item. In the other case, the system tries to post the quantity as the staging quantity, but if the units are not compatible, no staging quantity is posted, i.e. the This is convenient when you want to take out a part for an order item, but the part no longer exists (the part is invalid), but there is a replacement part that is compatible. Now the removal can be created for the compatible part. By ticking "Alternative part / quantity", the order item is then made available. If the tick is not set, the system assumes that it is an additional stock removal for the order, which means that the requirement is not yet covered. Example: 15 nails should be taken for a production order. Now, however, it is decided without further ado that the fixing should be done with one meter of double-sided adhesive tape. It is easy to create and book a retrieval of 1m of double-sided adhesive tape for this part requirement item with the check mark "Alternative part / quantity". The requirement of 15 nails is then booked out. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockWithdrawal" with the name "Outsourcing" regarding Storage area: If a part is dragged into the picking position, the main storage bin of the part is taken over into the document as storage bin. If there is no main storage bin for the part, the warehouse selection list on the stock removal document is filled with all storage bins of the part in which a movement has once taken place. The first entry is then selected and set as default. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockWithdrawal" with the name "Outsourcing" regarding Cost centre: By ticking the checkbox cost centre, it is possible at any time to also assign a production parts list outsourcing to a cost centre. This is conceivable, for example, if a certain part has been broken on the construction site by an own employee of a certain cost centre. This cost centre can then be specifically charged with the replacement of this part. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockWithdrawal" with the name "Outsourcing" regarding Cost unit: There is the possibility of charging an outsourcing to a cost unit, this is the case, for example, if an interested party wishes to receive a sample of a part for inspection in advance. In this case, there is not yet an order to which these costs could be linked. In this case it is a good idea to create a project (cost unit) for this interested party in which all costs are collected. The cost unit can be relieved by storing the goods if the part is not to your liking. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. How do I enter a withdrawal of goods using the "Outsourcing" module?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockWithdrawal" with the name "Outsourcing" regarding Create delivery notes: It is possible to create delivery notes from retrieval items. For this purpose, these must have an order item as a direct predecessor. The first order item with a delivery status is used, e.g. in stock removal the sub parts of a sales set are posted which has the delivery status in the order, in this case the sales set is drawn in the delivery note. If several stock removal items are assigned to the same order item, this is only used once in the delivery note with the open delivery quantity. Removal from stock items that directly have an order item with delivery status as predecessor are entered in the delivery note with the removal from stock quantity. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockWithdrawal" with the name "Outsourcing" regarding Own supplies: If a material withdrawal is to be used to plan an internal provision at level 0 of a sales order, an internal provision document must be created for this material withdrawal. This is possible via the material withdrawal item directly via the toolbar button possible. The part, quantity and description are taken over. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockWithdrawal" with the name "Outsourcing" regarding Post Calculation: In the post-calculation, a positive value is always included in the valuation for the removal from storage. Removals to cost units always represent a debit. To determine the costs to be debited, the standard procurement type (purchased part / production part) and then the costs are taken from the corresponding roll. Attention! If a stock-in was posted for a cost object via a purchased part, then the purchased part was converted as a production part and subsequently a stock-out was created as a discharge, the negative stock-in value continues to be in the purchased parts from stock column, the positive stock-out value can then be found in the production parts from stock column. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockWithdrawal" with the name "Outsourcing" regarding Mobile storage and retrieval: Mobile outsourcing enables so-called unplanned bookings for a project, order or cost centre to be easily booked. These can be, for example, withdrawals from a workshop warehouse or small parts warehouse for a project can be entered with this function and the cost unit can be charged. Storage aids with several parts are completely booked out. In the case of storage aids with only one part, you can post partial quantities from the storage aid. Parts can also be selected directly via your number and storage location The system checks whether stock is available when booking! This booking should not be used as a rule, as planned bookings are not processed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockWithdrawal" with the name "Outsourcing" regarding Position window: Stock removals can be assigned to a cost centre, a cost object or specific documents (sales order or item, warehouse order or item). This ensures that the costs of the parts removed are charged to the cost originator. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockWithdrawal" with the name "Outsourcing" regarding Grouping of selected items: The part, storage bin and quantity can be changed simultaneously for the items contained in the list. All items are assigned the same part and storage bin. The quantity is distributed proportionally to the items. This function is for parts that have pieces, sheets, plates or similar as a unit and all the rest is to be distributed to the bookings. Example: A part that is stored in plates and each plate has 3.125 m² as its area. Now 3 items are to be booked, but together they only have 2500000 mm ². Now this value can be changed in the quantity to "1 plate". After the OK button, the quantities of the positions are adjusted so that they result in 3.125 m² or 3125000 mm². This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockWithdrawal" with the name "Outsourcing" regarding List window: Serves to list the removals. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockWithdrawal" with the name "Outsourcing" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select a stock removal. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockWithdrawal" with the name "Outsourcing" regarding Options window: Here you can make all presettings for the data exchange. The window can only be closed with the "OK" button. Once set, options can be saved as default options for the logged-in user. For this purpose, on the "Preferences" tab, there is a context menu entry on the "User Preferences" list, via which the current options can be saved. This is the description of the functionality of the module "stockWithdrawal" with the name "Outsourcing" regarding Print option window: Only the additional options for printing a retrieval document should be displayed here. Here you can find the description of the remaining options.

This is the description of the module "cxReport" with the name "Reports (module)": In the ClassiX system all lists displayed on the screen can be transferred to other programs - such as Excel - via the clipboard. Consequently, reports can and are created from these lists. A report is - according to the ClassiX terminology - a list prepared with a design tool, the lists always represent the data basis for reports.It is therefore best to create a new report from the reporting window that has already been called up with the data of a list. Only in this case, i.e. if data (from a list) is already available, can you open the Designer report. If you do not have a current list window with data, however, you can also build on an already existing XML file.Alternatively, you may have opened the Report window because you want to edit an existing report. You can then, for example, change the name and/or the description or edit the layout of the report with the report design tool.Another way to create reports is to use the Data Query Wizard. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxReport" with the name "Reports (module)" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain reports. The Report tab in the input window contains some general information about a report. These can also be edited at this point and are saved by clicking on the save symbol or the OK button. If you create a new report, you should give the report a name in the Report name field and enter a more detailed description if necessary. The category in the ClassiX® system determines which reports belong to which list / list window. This should therefore be selected carefully. A special feature is that there are two buttons in the toolbar of this input window to start the report designer. The button Reporttool-Designer can always be used if data is already known, e.g. if this input window was called up from the Reporting window. The other possibility to start the Designer without having come out of the reporting window - i.e. no data is known - is the button Reporttool-Designer, load from file. You will be asked for an XML file.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxReport" with the name "Reports (module)" regarding Import and export: In order to make general changes to reports in a history manageable and to make changes to standard forms available to all ClassiX customers at once, there is the possibility to export reports into a text file or to import them from it. The resulting file name is composed as follows: If the "Customer derivation" indicator was set, the file is not exported directly to the standard report directory, but to a subdirectory with the customer abbreviation. If an attempt is made to import a standard form for which there is a customer derivation, the machine reports an error and terminates. It is therefore not possible to overwrite the customer derivation with a standard form. To ensure that there are no problems with encoding tables when importing and exporting, the rule was introduced that the short name and the module name must not contain any umlauts, spaces or special characters. This will be checked when saving and the report will not be saved if it does not comply with this rule. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxReport" with the name "Reports (module)" regarding Composition of the file name of a report: The following widgets are attracted for the filename: Context, Report Name and Custom Report.

Since the same access paths are often traversed when compiling the data format of a list, several access expressions can be configured together. Thus, for the configuration of several columns, navigation does not have to be started anew from the start object each time. This is the description of the functionality of the module "metaaccs" with the name "English:Meta Access" regarding Option window: All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed with the "OK" button.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "metaaccs" module based on its description:

1. What is the purpose of the "Meta-Access" objects in the "metaaccs" module?
2. How do I create a new "Meta-Access" object in the "input window"?
3. Can I manually create "Meta-Access" objects for access paths with procedure or function calls? If so, how?
4. What is the difference between a "Meta-Object" and a regular object in the context of "Meta-Access"?
5. How do I navigate through the meta model using the "Access Expressions" feature in the "Selection window"?
6. Can I configure multiple access expressions at once in the "Access Print Configurator"? If so, how?
7. What is the purpose of the "Option window" in the "metaaccs" module?
8. Is there a way to search for specific "Meta-Access" objects in the "List window"?

10. How do I close the "Option window" after making my desired changes?


Sure! I am ready to assist you. Kindly provide me with the description of the module you want me to create questions for.

This is the description of the module "cxAccessoryList" with the name "Packing list": The packing lists are used for internal deliveries to construction sites and thus distinguish themselves from external delivery notes. The packing lists thus provide an overview of the material flow between the companies and the construction sites of the articles that are not level 0 parts of the order. Consequently, packing lists can be created from the following documents:Order items without delivery statusProduction parts list items Goods receipt items Material withdrawal items In addition, free positions can be entered without a predecessor.The packing list can be printed and enclosed with the delivery. Thus, the reference to the goods can be established on the construction site. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessoryList" with the name "Packing list" regarding Creating packing lists: Packing lists can be created for order items without delivery status, production parts list items, goods receipt items, material withdrawal items. In the editing masks of the respective documents there is either a button in the toolbar ( ) to create the packing lists or a menu item "Packing list". In both cases you can choose via a submenu whether you want to create a new packing list or extend an existing packing list. If you want to extend an existing package insert list, it must be opened. In both cases the selected items (order item, production parts list item, etc.) of the editing mask are transferred to the supplement list. However, it is also possible to create a new (empty) accessory list and expand it using Drag&Drop. In this case, the items (order item, production BOM item, etc.) must be dragged into the item list of the packing list. In this way, a packing list item is created for each predecessor. The part and the quantity are automatically transferred. It is also possible to create a free packing list item. For this purpose press the "Create" button in the "Positions" tab. Now you have the possibility to create all data freely, like quantity, part and predecessor. All the above mentioned predecessor documents can now be dragged onto the predecessor field again. If no quantity has been entered or no part selected, the data of the predecessor will be taken over. If data has already been entered, it will not be overwritten. It is not possible to select stocked parts in free packing list positions without a predecessor. In this case the predecessor must be the retrieval item. If goods are to be delivered that are not entered in the parts master, simply leave the "Part" field empty and enter the goods in the description. When the packing list is created, the quantities are checked so that no overdelivery can occur. The packing list has no influence on the status of its predecessors. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxAccessoryList" with the name "Packing list" regarding Business process of the packing lists: There are three relevant states to describe the processing status of the packing lists.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorhqu" with the name "Offer and order Semi-fast entry" regarding Creating items in the list view: In a quotation/order, you have the possibility to switch between the tree structure and the list view in the Positions area. This is achieved by pressing the button on the left above the list. In the list view there is a simplified possibility to enter new items as in the fast entry. If you press the button Insert, the position number is automatically suggested, but can still be changed. Now jump to the next field on the right, above which the currently selected article type is shown. You can change this by clicking the right mouse button above the input field. A selection list of three possible article types appears: sales article, spare part and performance unit. After one has been selected, you can decide whether this offer/order item is a "real" article etc. from the master data, or whether it should be a so-called text article, which practically only exists in this offer/order. A text article is created by entering any number and not confirming it with Enter. So if the input field "Article" below is empty, a text article is created. But if you need a real article from the trunk, you have two possibilities to select it: If you want to change an article that is displayed in this list, you can select the article in the list and drag it with pressed mouse button into the field on the far left in the quick entry "Pos. This will cause this item to be displayed again in the fast entry and can thus be edited. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorhqu" with the name "Offer and order Semi-fast entry" regarding Nodes in the list view: In the list view, there are different ways to display the following items. When switching from the tree view to the list view, the selected position is used as the entry point. The positions of the nodes "Single level" are displayed, i.e. only the direct position of the node is shown. In the sub-nodes sub-nodes existing in the node are displayed and can be selected there to go one level lower. Subnodes can be groups, items with subdivisions and service specifications items. If "multi-level" is selected, all items below the node are displayed. The option "Without service specifications" allows you to hide the service specifications items in the list. These are then still displayed as sub-nodes. The "Free" column means "Release": whether the "Sales" and/or "Technical" release has been made. The column DL means "Direct delivery": Whether a requirement request following the order item is a direct delivery or not. This is the description of the functionality of the module "offorhqu" with the name "Offer and order Semi-fast entry" regarding Processing information: The positions can be edited using the menu bar, the context menu or the buttons in the upper right-hand part of the window. Insert When inserting item types, the user is prompted to select the desired part via a selection window. For further information on the item window that appears, see the documentation on offer/order items. Duplicate It is also possible to 'Duplicate' a selected item. This creates an identical item (with all sub-items) with the next higher item number. Delete Deletes the previously selected item.

This is the description of the module "PriceDiscount" with the name "Complex price or discount and surcharge": Prices Create/edit Important notes Complex price Complex discount/supplement Test prices Price history/validity list Copy buffer. This is the description of the functionality of the module "PriceDiscount" with the name "Complex price or discount and surcharge" regarding Prices Create/edit: In ClassiX® there are three, for sales articles even four, possibilities to edit a price. The desired option can be selected via the context menu of the price button selectable. Important notes Before editing a price, check whether it is necessary to move the old price to the price history and create a new one. If this is not done, the pricing of old offers / orders and also orders cannot be tracked. The entry of a conditional discount/surcharge table may not have any discounts/surcharges itself. Only one price, no matter on which level, may be extended/nested. This is the description of the functionality of the module "PriceDiscount" with the name "Complex price or discount and surcharge" regarding Complex price: A price can be defined as a chain of any length (mainly in master data) and then represents a basic price with increase/decrease prices and discounts/surcharges. The chain can be edited in this module in list form. The following terms are used to describe such a prize:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "PriceDiscount" with the name "Complex price or discount and surcharge" regarding Example:: Price as a price scale depending on the NWIDTH feature (nominal width) plus an additional price according to the design (DESIGN feature) minus a 1% discount: (See detailed example, here the values at NWIDTH = 600mm, DESIGN="two air inlets"). This is the description of the functionality of the module "PriceDiscount" with the name "Complex price or discount and surcharge" regarding Complex discount/supplement: A discount or surcharge can also be defined as a chain of any length, in which case the first link does not differ in its functionality from other links. Example: discount -3% - 1% + 1,00 € A result of this complex price can be tested via the lower part of the window as described below. Please note: Prices with conditions are calculated in the orders as follows: Unit price * quantity + conditions = total value Example: 5,50 € / 1 piece * 20 pieces + 15 % = total value. This is the description of the functionality of the module "PriceDiscount" with the name "Complex price or discount and surcharge" regarding Test prices: To test prices with conditional discounts or generally conditional prices, it is possible to add object characteristics to the object characteristics list. In this way, the price can be tested for different constellations and quantities. Only the price per unit is always displayed, which is the total sum resulting from the entered quantity and unit price! (Example: Maybe the price per unit will change if you want to buy 100 pieces) The attributes are saved in a temporary data field on the price and are therefore available unchanged the next time the user enters the price. If the characteristics are to be determined again from the owner, the adjacent button must be pressed. All characteristics are then deleted and redrawn from the owner. If it is a part roll that does not have its own material characteristics, they are drawn from the main part. This is the description of the functionality of the module "PriceDiscount" with the name "Complex price or discount and surcharge" regarding Price history/validity list: If a price changes in the course of time, you can of course simply overwrite the old price. In this case, however, it is the case that you do not have an overview of how the price has developed over a period of time. To be able to record this movement as well, the prices can be provided with validities. You don't just double click on the price and change it, but press the "New" button at the bottom of the window. A small menu opens, which offers the possibility to create an exact copy of the price. The old price is invalidated by the validity date and the new one is set as currently valid. Now you can change the new price and see how this price has developed in the validity list. The following example shows a possible price history: It is shown here that the price from 17.04.2003 to 20.04.2003 was calculated from a price table, which was also clearly broken down here. On 21.04.2003 this price has changed so that always a price with a discount (10%) was valid. Whether the discount is based on list price or net can be seen in the list. The blue heading tries to show the price in its completeness. If this is not possible due to complex prices, only the heading Price table is displayed, followed by a complete breakdown. The individual links of a price chain are shown in green. Next to price tables are the "unfolded" symbols, followed by a breakdown of the individual prices and conditions. By double-clicking on the blue line, the editing window will open, allowing you to edit this price. When creating a new price with new validity - manually in individual cases or automatically during a price increase run - the plausibility of the price history is checked by checking whether the validity of the new price overlaps with the validity of an existing price. If this is the case, the price change is terminated with an error message. The validity of the prices can also be changed via the editing window of the prices. Here the plausibility of the prices is also checked. The message of the overlapping of two price validities is only displayed as a warning message, so that the validity of the price that is not currently being edited can be adjusted if necessary. 
Sure, I'd be happy to assist! Based on the given module description, here are some potential questions that an unfamiliar user might ask:

1. How many types of discounts and surcharges can be applied to a single price?
2. Can I define multiple levels of conditional discounts and surcharges within a single price?
3. What happens if I enter incorrect or incomplete information when defining a conditional discount or surcharge?
4. How do I test the effectiveness of my conditional discounts and surcharges before applying them to live prices?
5. Can I view the historical development of a price over time, including any changes made to conditional discounts and surcharges?
6. Is it possible to duplicate an existing price and apply a new validity period to it?
7. How do I prevent overlapping validity periods between different prices?
8. Can I adjust the validity periods of multiple prices simultaneously?
9. Are there any limitations on the number of conditional discounts and surcharges that can be applied to a single price?
10. How do I access the detailed breakdown of a price chain to understand the various components contributing to the final price?

Please let me know if these questions cover all aspects of the module description, or if there are any further clarifications needed.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "PriceDiscount" with the name "Complex price or discount and surcharge" regarding Copy buffer: Using the copy buffer, which can be called up from the menu, individual discounts or surcharges can be copied into other prices of other parts. However, the main price cannot be copied because there can only be one in the list and this cannot be deleted from the list. In this way, complex discount price tables can be copied very quickly. This is the description of the functionality of the module "PriceDiscount" with the name "Complex price or discount and surcharge" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain complex prices or discounts/surcharges. This is the description of the functionality of the module "PriceDiscount" with the name "Complex price or discount and surcharge" regarding Editing window of prices and costs: Processing of costs and prices This window is very similar to the input window described above, except that wherever the value is displayed or edited, one (purchase cost for a purchased part) or two (standard cost of material and labour for a manufactured part) cost fields are displayed simultaneously. Which cost fields are displayed is controlled by the logistics indicator. The part roles, which are responsible for the costs and prices, are also displayed in the module. The prices and costs can then be edited directly from the module. In doing so, the editor should note that he directly changes the data of the roles. When switching the price type (value per quantity, formula, percent, table), the price/cost type of the roll is also changed automatically. If different price/cost types are found, the user will be informed by two red dots. The red text also indicates the different value types. This is the description of the functionality of the module "PriceDiscount" with the name "Complex price or discount and surcharge" regarding Creation of price tables for costs and prices: This module offers the simplest way to create price tables for costs and prices, as prices are usually linked to the same conditions as costs. Normally the agent would go into the sales role and create the price table and do the same for the material and labour costs of the production role. He would therefore have to create three almost identical tables. Using the module for parallel editing of prices and costs the following steps are sufficient. First of all, the type of the prices must be set to "Table". Then the button can be used to open the module for editing a price table. The columns are created identically to the "normal" price tables. The only difference is that in this price table there is not only the column for the price but also the column for the costs. In the background, the step that only has to be done once here is automatically carried out for all price and cost tables. So you can go back to the parts roll and you will only find one (the normal) price table here. This is the description of the functionality of the module "PriceDiscount" with the name "Complex price or discount and surcharge" regarding Price history: This window displays the price history. This is the description of the functionality of the module "PriceDiscount" with the name "Complex price or discount and surcharge" regarding Price history: Graphic display of the price development. This is the description of the functionality of the module "PriceDiscount" with the name "Complex price or discount and surcharge" regarding Simulative price-cost comparison: Through this window it is possible to compare sales prices and costs of a part where the structure of the complex pricing is different. This is the description of the functionality of the module "PriceDiscount" with the name "Complex price or discount and surcharge" regarding Option window: Use the option window to set the default settings. If, for example, prices of several articles are changed and the new price is always only valid from the turn of the year, the changeover date, which is preset with the session date, can be overwritten.

Sure! I am ready to assist you. Kindly provide me with the description of the module you want me to create questions for.

This is the description of the module "qm_listviewOboxEdit_qm" with the name "English:ObjectListView::OboxEdit": Test of OboxEdit with ObjectListView.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "qm_listviewOboxEdit_qm" module based on its description:

This is the description of the module "item" with the name "Part master data": The ClassiX® system distinguishes between a part and the possible roles of a part. A part itself contains the descriptive data that can be named regardless of its use. For example, a part could be completely described by "carpet". Depending on its use, further data entities or roles are obtained: If the "carpet" is sold, then sales-specific data such as sales price, is maintained in the role sales item . Further roles would be order article (with data like main supplier, last purchase price) , production part (with data like bill of material, routing, lot size), etc. In ClassiX® any roles can be assigned to a part.Furthermore, ClassiX® distinguishes between single part, sub-part and variant part:A variant part describes a group of things or parts that are distinguished by certain characteristics: For example, "carpet" can be distinguished by colour and width. We then say that the variant part "carpeting" is described by the characteristic bar with the characteristics colour and width.A subpart is a unique characteristic of a variant part, e.g. "Carpet: Colour red, width 4m" . There is a direct assignment to a variant part, in our example to the variant part "carpet". Sub-parts can be detached (decoupled) from a variant part at any time and thus become an individual part.Individual parts are not variant parts and are not subordinate to a variant part. Individual parts can, however, be subsequently assigned (coupled) to variant parts. Usually, most EDP systems only support single parts.The advantage of processing with variant parts is that previously unknown characteristics of a part do not always have to lead to data entry. For example, if a customer wants a "carpet" with the colour pink and a "carpet" of this colour has never been processed before, this "carpet" can be ordered directly from the supplier as a variant part with the new characteristic pink without entering a new order article.The characteristic bar of a variant part consists of various characteristics or attributes. In our example above, these were the attributes colour and size . The attribute size can also be a formula attribute, i.e. it is calculated from the attributes"length times width". In this case, the attributes length and width must be specified in the subpart.The variant part "carpet" can of course be specified more precisely by further attributes. For example, material type (such as wool, plastic, or similar), pile thickness (in mm), pattern, etc. would be possible. One could even go so far as to define all carpets in the world as a sub-part of only one variant part. However, this would require an increase in the number of characteristics to be able to describe each carpet in a sufficiently distinguishable way from the others.To what extent parts are described with different variant parts - or whether variant parts are used at all - depends very much on the individual case. A DIY store may have only a few (or even only one) "carpet" variants, whereas a carpet manufacturer will prefer a more structured structure of its "carpet" variants.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "item" with the name "Part master data" regarding Input Window: This window is used to maintain the part master. You can select a part by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If several parts with the entered number exist, the selection window with these parts is displayed. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". In the menu under "Edit -> Variants -> Filter part number" you can set which part type can be searched for in the field number. When you create a new part, you should first determine whether it is a single part, a variant part or a subpart (Edit -> Variant part -> Part type). The part number for single and variant parts should be unique. When creating a sub-part, the 'Variant part' field appears to select the variant part to which the sub-part is to be assigned. Then assign a part number that makes sense to fit into the part master. Subparts can be created very easily by first calling up its variant part and then pressing the 'Insert' button in the list of subparts. A subpart is then automatically created, linked to the previously called variant and you only have to maintain the specific attributes / characteristics of the part. Existing subparts can be copied by right-clicking on the subpart to be copied in the subpart list of the variant part and selecting "Copy". All part data is copied to the new part, including all characteristic settings as well as MRP and stock account settings. Part roles and provision data on the logistics account are not copied. You can create a new part role by calling up the corresponding menu item in the "Edit" menu. If the part role has already been defined, it is indicated by a button in the toolbar. You can change the stock data of the part with the button or the menu item "Stock account" to view and change it. With a tick in front of Spare part or QA part you can declare the new part as a spare part or provide it for QA inspection. In the lower section of the window, under Characteristics, you can insert or delete characteristics. Save your data with OK. You can use the validity to exclude individual parts that are no longer to be used from the current part master. It should be noted that this also has an influence on parts lists and stock levels. Invalid parts can lead to error messages if they have not been replaced. To be able to edit existing parts, select the corresponding part via the selection window by double-clicking on it. Via 'Edit' you can change search terms, insert and create characteristics, jump to the warehouse account, the purchasing data, etc. and edit them. Since non-controlling attributes can be assigned to each subpart, they appear grey in the list. The column headings of these attributes change depending on which subpart you have selected. Controlling attributes are shown in turquoise. Subparts can be decoupled from the variant part and then treated as individual parts in the system. This way, the part could then be declared invalid, for example. A picture can be stored for a part in the "Picture" tab. This is then saved in the database. A picture can be loaded via the button "Select picture". The radio buttons allow switching between the display in original size and the dynamically adjusted view, where the image is displayed in the current window size. This is the description of the functionality of the module "item" with the name "Part master data" regarding Convert to batch-managed part: Create a batch-managed part from an existing single part. This is the description of the functionality of the module "item" with the name "Part master data" regarding Part status: The part status defines the different statuses that a part can have. The part status is thus an important element of the part life cycle. The part status is defined via the status term "ITEM_STATE". This evaluation group can contain both simple structure nodes and structure statuses . In the case of structure status, the status is automatically determined by transition conditions in other structure statuses. All simple structure nodes and the beginning of the status chain of the structure statuses are displayed for selection. Thus, the classification term "ITEM_STATE" could be structured as follows, for example: - In progress - Locked - Released (with conditional follow-up status) In this example, the UNDER_WAY, LOCKED, DELETED and RELEASED statuses can be set in the part by the user. RELEASED can be selected because this is the only structure status that is not referenced by any other status and is therefore recognised as the start status. The subsequent statuses are then derived from the data of the part. In the right-hand image, the status RELEASED is also shown next to the status definition. Through the transition condition (Expr.) "true", the part is automatically forwarded to the next status. From the next status, the status then determines which part data must be recorded and the part status is switched on when this has been done. The following examples provide an overview of the data that can be queried and the formula expression that can be used to do this. Options for editing and using the parts can be stored at the individual statuses. These options are stored as attributes at the structure node (see also Attributes/Properties and there in particular the paragraph: Attributes with control function).

This is the description of the functionality of the module "item" with the name "Part master data" regarding Common disposition or stock account for variant parts: Attention: These option fields are only visible if the option to set the joint accounts on the"Logistics" tab has been set via the client! For variant parts, it is possible to create a common disposition and warehouse account for all sub-parts and the variant part. This is useful, among other things, if it is irrelevant in which version a variant part is in stock. In this way, an MRP movement of a sub-part is only registered in the MRP account of the variant part. Nevertheless, all information on which sub-part the corresponding movement refers to remains available. This common account is activated via the part master mask via the checkbox "Common MRP account". If different MRP accounts already exist for the existing subparts, these are collected and moved to the MRP account of the variant part. See also AccountOwner. It is also possible to split this common dispo account again via the menu item Edit->Split dispo account. Now all individual entries are assigned to the corresponding sub-parts again. This is the description of the functionality of the module "item" with the name "Part master data" regarding Change part settings with Wizzard: This wizzard can be used to set settings for a group of selected parts in one. The selection of parts can still be changed with the wizzard open. The checkboxes in front of the groups "Part class", "Manufacturer", "Product number", "Status" and "Properties" can be used to hide or show the data fields. Data fields that are shown are changed in the parts by the wizard. These groups are not changed by hiding them. This is the description of the functionality of the module "item" with the name "Part master data" regarding Options window: Here you can select whether the name, e.g. "FAB_TEIL", or the description, e.g. "Fabrikat", of the individual characteristic is to be displayed in the column headers of the characteristic columns in the list of subparts. Each time the input window is opened, the option is reset to the default, i.e. the display of the name.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "montagestuecklisten" with the name "Assembly parts lists" regarding Structural assembly: A component consists of several sub-assemblies to be assembled. In the exploded parts list you can see the subassemblies to be assembled under the main part. However, the production itself would like to save the sub-steps for assembling and scheduling the sub-assemblies and only assemble them directly when assembling the main part. In these cases, the sub-assemblies are marked as constructive assemblies in the BOM, i.e. the design sees these parts as sub-assemblies, but in production the sub-parts of the constructive assemblies all run together without the constructive assemblies. Production therefore sees this BOM as shown in Fig. 3 The subparts of a constructive assembly located in the exploded production bill of materials are moved up one level in the production order as if the constructive assembly were not even present in the exploded bill of materials and all subparts of the constructive assembly are moved directly to the position where the constructive assembly itself is located. Figure 1: normal parts list view picture 2: constructive view figure 3: dispositive view (production view). This is the description of the functionality of the module "montagestuecklisten" with the name "Assembly parts lists" regarding Disposable assembly: In the case of the disposable assemblies, a distinction must be made between 2 different scenarios: If a bill of material is linked in a production role and an entry exists in the MRP product structure, the specified part is "pushed" on the entry of the MRP product structure below the production part when the production bill of material is exploded. All parts which are specified in the bill of material item list on the purely MRP assembly are therefore moved from the higher-level bill of material below the new entry. To create a purely MRP assembly, the system starts from the production role to be inserted in between, creates a purely MRP entry there and selects the bill of material with its items from the higher-level bill of material. This purely dispositive entry is then visible both in the initial production roll and in the production roll of the intermediate part. Attention! A purely MRP assembly is not visible in the normal production BOM display: In the dispositive manufacturing structure, the purely dispositive assembly "Test3" appears in the end. For this part a part request item is also created. The parts cx0005 and cx0006 are then arranged below it. An MRP assembly defined by the master is a production part that does not have its own BOM and contains entries from other, higher-level BOMs in another production part in the "MRP product structure" list.(See here for technical pattern or here for further description). 
Sure, I'd be happy to assist you! Here are some potential questions based on the given module description:

1. How do I create a constructive assembly in the montage stuecklisten module?
2. Can I move individual components within a constructive assembly in the exploded Bill of Materials (BOM)?
3. What is the difference between a constructive assembly and a disposable assembly in the montage stuecklisten module?
4. How do I create a purely MRP assembly in the montage stuecklisten module?
5. Can I link a bill of material to a production role in the montage stuecklisten module?
6. How do I distinguish between constructive and disposable assemblies in the montage stuecklisten module?
7. Is it possible to push parts from a higher-level bill of material into a lower-level bill of material in the montage stuecklisten module?
8. Can I create a part request item for a purely MRP assembly in the montage stuecklisten module?
9. How do I ensure that all necessary components are included in the production order for a constructive assembly in the montage stuecklisten module?

This is the description of the functionality of the module "montagestuecklisten" with the name "Assembly parts lists" regarding Instructions for setting up intermediate stages in variant parts lists: Here is a guide to setting up intermediate stages (purely MRP assemblies) in variant parts lists, which are only to apply to certain versions of the variant part, i.e. to certain sub-parts. These instructions are step-by-step, so it looks more complicated than it actually is. Step 1: First of all, all the subparts for which an intermediate stage is to be created must be selected: Step 2: The intermediate stage must be created as a variant part. Step 3: Creating the new production roll We create a production role for this new variant part, select no parts list and save. Then we insert a purely MRP assembly via the "Create" button in the "MRP product structure" group. We confirm the question with "Yes". In the newly opened window, we press the button "Parts list" and search for the parts list that belongs to the finished variant part in the search list that appears. Double-click on the entry found; it is then transferred to the small window of the purely dispositive assembly. We enter the reference quantity of 1 piece and save the new purely dispositive assembly. After saving, we can now drag all the BOM items of the original BOM into the lower item list. To do this, press the button next to the parts list. A parts list tree opens. The top level in this tree is to be expanded and all the sub-items that can now be seen are to be dragged individually into the list. Attention: The conditional items must also be dragged into the list as they are, NOT JUST A CERTAIN EXPRESSION of them! Then save with OK. Step 4: Enter the condition in the MRP assembly. Now the dispositive assembly is marked out in the parts list of the painted variant part for all subparts. However, we want this assembly to be valid only for our three versions, so we have to switch to the "Condition" tab in the window of the purely dispositive assembly, tick Condition and enter a formula in the formula field. This formula is composed as follows: 1 Part: Get the numbers from the corresponding data fields (different for BOMs, stock order items and preliminary parts costing). 2nd part: Comparison of the determined number with our sub-part numbers. Here, the numbers of the painted and unpainted subparts must be specified as shown in the example below! Formula: Step 5: Creation of the production rolls for the lacquered lower parts So that the sub-parts that have received an intermediate stage do not receive the complete routing of the entire construction stage on the top level (in which there is only the unpainted part), these sub-parts must still receive their own production role on which we only need to overwrite the routing. So we open the painted variant part, then open the editing mask of the subpart by double-clicking on the corresponding subpart, select the menu item "Edit->Part Rolls->Production Data", then change the number in the production role mask of the variant part and save. When saving, an important question appears asking whether the production data should apply to the sub-part. Be sure to answer the question with "Yes". Now a new production role has been created for the bottom part. We click with the right mouse button on the entered routing and select the entry "Create". The editing screen for the new routing opens, which immediately receives the number of the lower part. It can be saved immediately. Then insert the new routing item "Final painting" and save it. Now the number of the routing can be noted and the mask closed. The production role is now connected to the new routing and can also be closed. Back to the part master mask. The next sub-part is marked and a production role is inserted. The routing that we have just created is now also searched for here via the "Routing" button, selected and connected by subsequently saving it. The same applies to the third sub-part with intermediate stage.

Sure! I am ready to assist you. Kindly provide me with the description of the module you want me to create questions for.

This is the description of the module "metamodl" with the name "English:meta model": Due to its business model classes and data fields, Classix does not have a rigid model and therefore no central administration of entities and data fields. In order to be able to describe the dynamically created objects, their attributes and relationships, an ObjectCrawler is implemented with this module, which independently scans the database, collects, examines and categorises objects and stores this information as meta-description. These meta descriptions of the objects and their attributes and relationships can then be maintained here. Before starting the search, you must define the settings for the search, on which the speed and duration of the search depend. The following settings are available: Under the boundary conditions you can specify the maximum age of the meta-info. To speed up the search, meta-information is not overwritten and skipped if it is younger than the set date. Transaction splitting is used to specify after how many transactions (analyses of meta objects) the results are saved in the database. The maximum collection depth specifies how many elements of an M1, MN relation, or collection are analysed (if set to 0, all elements of a collection are searched). The maximum collection depth can significantly influence the duration of the crawling process, a value of 500, and 5 for very large databases, can lead to fast results. Equally important for the duration of the crawling process is the recursion depth parameter (-1 stands for infinite depth). The recursion depth determines how far the crawler should recursively examine the references of an object. Regardless of this setting, the ObjectCrawler always performs a width search, i.e. referenced objects are only examined after all siblings of an object have been examined. The last and most important option is the REP start index, which tells where the object crawler is located when searching the database. The crawler searches the database in such a way that it takes a single object from each REP and examines it to get a clear and meaningful picture of the database as quickly as possible. This so-called REP start index determines the current (start) index of this object extraction from the REPs. -1 lets the crawler take a random element from each REP, but if you want to do a full scan, you should start at 0 and observe the increment of this value to know where the crawler is at that moment. If this value exceeds the maximum length of a REP, the crawler is automatically stopped and you have thus scanned the entire REP. Under the runtime options you can limit the crawling duration of the object crawler. By default you let the crawler run until you stop it (the cancel button in the progressbar window closes the search with EndTXN and therefore the button is more a stop button than a cancel button) or until it is finished. You can stop the crawler automatically after the first run by selecting the option with the same name or only when the queue with all REP objects from the first run including their referenced objects is processed and empty by selecting the corresponding option Stop crawler when queue is empty. Depending on the selected option, you can control the behaviour in case of errors. In this sense, errors are not InstantView errors but logical consistency errors in the database. It is recommended to select the option Log error and continue. Under other settings you can define various options like: ObjectCrawler logging: all ObjectCrawler operations are written to separate log files. Process backreferences intelligently: if this option is selected, certain class checks are performed when examining backreferences to prevent errors. This is the description of the functionality of the module "metamodl" with the name "English:meta model" regarding ObjectCrawler: In this window the ObjectCrawler is given the parameters for traversing the database.

This is the description of the module "cxCurrencyTable" with the name "Currency table": The conversion of currencies, unlike the conversion of other units, is a special case in that the relationship (i.e. the exchange rate) between two currencies is not fixed but changes daily. The conversion must be done using a currency table that defines exchange rates between different currencies. This currency table can be present in the system - for individual days or periods of time it may be different - but it can exist several times.In order to be able to differentiate between these - time dependent - currency tables, it is advisable to give the currency tables unique names (e.g. EUROFX for the currency table of the ECB (European Central Bank) which can be updated daily). All currency tables of a certain name are kept apart as to their validity, i.e. only one currency table of a certain name should be valid in the system at any given time. In order to have up-to-date conversion rates, you can have the rates updated automatically via the Internet.Normally, the system converts a value in a foreign currency to the value of the local currency using the currently logged in currency table. In some cases, this may be undesirable, for example, for outgoing invoices, incoming invoices and the transfer of bank statements. In these cases, the currency table valid only on a certain day may be used instead of the currently registered currency table. The necessary settings for this are made in the client (see for outgoing invoices, incoming invoices and bank statements).Besides the currency tables, which are valid for the whole system after logging in, there are also tables which can only be assigned to one company (one customer). (see customer documentation and foreign currency). This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxCurrencyTable" with the name "Currency table" regarding Direct Conversion: Direct conversion uses exactly one exchange rate to convert one currency into another. The list of exchange rates is run through one after the other and the first exchange rate that can be used for conversion is used. If a conversion is to be possible with several exchange rates, i.e. "across other currencies", indirect conversion is to be used. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxCurrencyTable" with the name "Currency table" regarding Indirect conversion: In contrast to direct conversions, indirect conversions can be used to convert "across multiple currencies". For example, if a "€" amount is to be converted into "$", it is not necessary to define an exchange rate between these two currencies. If there is an exchange rate between "€" and "£" and between "£" and "$", a "€" amount can be converted into "$" by "detouring" from "£" to "$". The length of the conversion path is irrelevant. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxCurrencyTable" with the name "Currency table" regarding Update: As exchange rates are subject to fluctuations, it is necessary to update the currency tables. For this purpose ClassiX® provides a function for automatic updating via Internet. The basis for the update are the reference rates of other currencies to the Euro, which are published daily by the European Central Bank. The rates are available online at http://www.ecb.int/stats/exchange/eurofxref/html/index.en.html. In parallel, the ECB also provides the rates in an XML file, which is more suitable for automatic processing. This XML file is also used by the ClassiX® system to update the currency tables. The update can be done either online, i.e. ClassiX® tries to load the XML file and updates the currency tables, or offline, if no internet access is available. In this case the XML file has to be copied to the computer by other means and can then be read out. 
Sure! Here are some potential questions based on the provided module description:

1. How many currency tables can exist in the system simultaneously?
2. What is the difference between direct and indirect conversion in cxCurrencyTable?
3. Can the currency tables be updated manually, or is it only possible to do so automatically via the internet?
4. Are there any restrictions on which customers can utilize the customer-specific currency tables?
5. Is it feasible to assign various exchange rates to distinct companies or clients?
6. How frequently are the currency tables updated when performed automatically via the internet?
7. Does the system support conversion across numerous currencies without requiring separate exchange rates for each pair of currencies?
8. Which method is preferred for converting values in foreign currencies—direct or indirect conversion?
9. Can the system handle conversion paths involving multiple currencies?
10. How does the system determine which currency table is valid for a particular date?

I hope these questions cover all aspects of the module description!

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxCurrencyTable" with the name "Currency table" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain currency tables. You can select a currency table by entering the ID of the desired object (e.g. EUROFX) in the "ID" field and confirm with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". {img type="fileId" fileId="376" thumb="box" width="100%"} The input window also contains a function for automatically updating currency tables of a particular name. This function can be reached via the menu item "Update". The sub-menu contains menu items for various sources with current exchange rate data (currently only "ECB" (European Central Bank)). Each menu item contains the sub-items "Online" and "Offline" (or just one of them), which allow updating directly via the Internet or via a locally saved file (in the XML format specified by the ECB). The two types of updating ("online" and "offline") are explained in more detail below. Online update When updating online, the new course data is downloaded directly from the Internet. For this purpose, a URL must be provided which specifies the source exactly (see also above). {img type="fileId" fileId="380" thumb="box" width="100%"} The valid currency table registered in the system is offered as the table (to be updated): only the currencies specified in this table are transferred to a new currency table with the current values. If you want to load all the currencies offered by the ECB or if you had not yet defined a currency table in the system, the "Table" field remains empty and you will get a new currency table with all the exchange rates defined by the ECB. (This table could then be adjusted for the unneeded exchange rates in order to have a suitable initial table for the next update). In general, only one currency table may be valid at a time. This table is automatically selected and registered when ClassiX® is started. Therefore the start date of validity must be specified. By default the date of the exchange rate data is selected here. However, the radio button can also be used to select your own date. The currency table currently valid up to this point is automatically marked as invalid. It expires on the day before the start of the validity of the current table. Offline update The offline update works in the same way as the online update, with the only difference that instead of a URL to the data source on the Internet, this time a path to a file with the new course data serves as the basis. {img type="fileId" fileId="378" thumb="box" width="100%"} In this case (data source "ECB") the file "euroxref-daily.xml" in the directory Projects\Data below CX_ROOTDIR is offered as a preselection. By clicking on the "Select" button, however, another file in another directory can be selected in a simple manner. With the button "Start" the loading process is started, with "Close" the dialogue is closed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxCurrencyTable" with the name "Currency table" regarding List window: Used to list the currency tables. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxCurrencyTable" with the name "Currency table" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select a currency table. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxCurrencyTable" with the name "Currency table" regarding Overview: For the management of exchange rates ClassiX®provides the classes CX_CURRENCY_RATE and CX_CURRENCY_TABLE. An object of the first class defines a single exchange rate, while an object of the second class contains a table of exchange rates. This table can contain not only exchange rates, but also other (subordinate) exchange rate tables. Currency conversion functionality exists in both classes, but a table is usually used for conversion.

This is the description of the module "sacoest" with the name "Calculation of sales costs": In order to find out how much a set of parts would cost the company, or how much a customer order would bring in, without having to create an order or a quotation, there is the sales cost calculation module.Here it is possible to drag and drop sales roles such as sales sets into a list and mark them out. Once the quantity has been defined and set, the objects can be exploded, i.e. the attached parts can be determined in the first step. For each of these, an entry is created in a further list, which contains the part or the exploded subpart.In the next step, depending on the main procurement type (logistics indicator of the part), either the production or the order role is used to create an entry in the next list.Up to this point, all lists can also be supplemented manually by simply adding parts or order/production rolls.In the last step, the parts from the procurement roles in the penultimate list are then used for costing. These are then used to calculate the final value that these parts will cost.The parts of the first list, on the other hand, result in the sales price, or in the final sum the sales value. These final values can be read at the bottom of the list of characteristics.It is possible to drop order items into the sales parts list. All material characteristic settings and the quantity of the order item are transferred to the sales cost calculation item. The order item is linked to the sales cost calculation item as an association if the processing mode is persistent. It can now be found via the document history of the order item. It is also possible to duplicate or copy individual entries by dropping them from the copy buffer or document history. If an item with a sales set is copied in this way, all the lower parts of the set are also copied. This is the description of the functionality of the module "sacoest" with the name "Calculation of sales costs" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain sales cost calculations. This is the description of the functionality of the module "sacoest" with the name "Calculation of sales costs" regarding Position window: Use this window to maintain sales cost calculation items. This is the description of the functionality of the module "sacoest" with the name "Calculation of sales costs" regarding List window: This window serves to list all persistently saved sales cost calculations. This is the description of the functionality of the module "sacoest" with the name "Calculation of sales costs" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select sales cost calculations. This is the description of the functionality of the module "sacoest" with the name "Calculation of sales costs" regarding Option window: All settings for creating sales cost calculations can be made here. This is the description of the functionality of the module "sacoest" with the name "Calculation of sales costs" regarding Grouped calculation: If an order or a plant consists of many individual items, this window can be used to determine whether there are price advantages on the cost side as a result of combining quantities. If, for example, the order contains three times the same lever that has to be produced, the three order items can be combined to form a production order. This is simulated in this window during the preliminary cost calculation. The individual work steps thus save considerable wage time in makeready. In the case of order parts, it may be possible to purchase a larger lot from the supplier at a lower purchase. In this case, the costs are therefore determined using the total quantity of all items. Sales Costs In connection with sales sets, the sales costs and contribution margin are only displayed correctly if all cost entries have been selected before this window was opened. If the option "Display totals of selected items only" is set, incorrect contribution margins can occur with sales set subitems if the sales sets maintain their own prices and do not calculate them from the subitems. This is the description of the functionality of the module "sacoest" with the name "Calculation of sales costs" regarding Module names: sacoest.mod sacoedt.mod sacosel.mod sacoitm.mod.

This is the description of the module "orderfav" with the name "Order grouping": With this module, the items of an order can be structured under different aspects. While the order tree looks at the items from a commercial point of view, this module can be used to arrange and summarise the items from a technical point of view, for example. This is the description of the functionality of the module "orderfav" with the name "Order grouping" regarding Perform standard structuring: When the grouping window is called up for the first time, only the topmost job node is created. Subfolders can then be added manually via "Create new order". However, it is also possible to define a standard structure via the order terms, which is automatically adopted the first time the grouping window is called up. In this way a uniform structure of the different orders can be forced. The structure in the order terms must have the ID "ORDER_STRUCTURE". This is the description of the functionality of the module "orderfav" with the name "Order grouping" regarding Grouping window: In this window, the structure folders can be maintained and the order items can be added by drag & drop. This is the description of the functionality of the module "orderfav" with the name "Order grouping" regarding Folder: These folders can then be dragged into almost all lists, so that all customers in this folder are immediately included in the list. This is the description of the functionality of the module "orderfav" with the name "Order grouping" regarding Window: Compare nodes: Use this window to compare structure nodes. To do this, you can drag and drop nodes from the grouping window into the fields "Node 1" and "Node 2" and start the comparison via the toolbar button. The identical positions, which are present under both nodes, are displayed in the corresponding list. Positions which exist exclusively under the respective nodes are displayed in the separate lists below the nodes.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_construction" with the name "Construction" regarding part trunk: The ClassiX® system distinguishes between a part and the possible roles of a part. A part itself contains the descriptive data, which can be named independently of its use. A part could for example be completely described by "carpet". Depending on its use, one receives further data entities or roles: If the "carpet" is sold, sales-specific data such as sales price is maintained in the role sales article . Further roles would be order item (with data such as main supplier, last purchase price), production part (with data such as bill of material, routing, lot size), etc. In ClassiX® any role can be assigned to a part. Furthermore, a distinction is made between ClassiX® single parts, lower parts and variant parts: The advantage of processing with variant parts is that previously non-existent versions of a part do not always have to lead to data acquisition. If, for example, a customer wants a "carpet" with the colour pink and a "carpet" of this colour has never been processed before, this "carpet" can be ordered as a variant part with the new pink colour directly from the supplier without entering a new order article. The characteristics list of a variant part consists of various characteristics or attributes. In our example above these were the attributes colour and size. The size attribute can also be a formula attribute, i.e. it is calculated from the attributes"length times width". In this case, the attributes length and width must be specified in the lower part. The variant part "carpet" can of course be specified more precisely by means of further features. For example, the type of material (such as wool, plastic, etc.), pile thickness (in mm), pattern, etc. One could even go so far as to define all the carpets in the world as the lower part of just one variant. To do this, however, the number of characteristics would have to be increased to a point where each carpet is sufficiently distinguishable from the others. To what extent parts with different variant parts are described - or whether variant parts are used at all - depends very much on the individual case. A DIY store may have only a few (or even only one) "carpet" variants, whereas a carpet manufacturer will prefer a more structured structure of his "carpet" variants. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. {img type="fileId" fileId="273" thumb="box" width="100%"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_construction" with the name "Construction" regarding 2. parts lists: Parts lists describe the composition of a production part. A bill of material consists of parts, which in turn can have a bill of material. Each bill of material item describes which parts are required in which quantity for the production of the manufacturing part. There are two types of item: The basic heading contains a parts master record which is required in the specified (constant or calculated) quantity. A conditional BOM item is a conditional list of individual items. When exploding the BOM, the first item whose condition is fulfilled is used. If a subpart is inserted in a parts list, its characteristics are not automatically transferred, as these parts lists do not represent master data. During further processing of the parts list in orders or similar, the master data of the individual parts "shine through" and can then be changed later. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. For further information on purely disposable assemblies and constructive assemblies as well as instructions for creating purely disposable intermediate stages in a variant parts list, please refer to the assembly parts list documentation. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_construction" with the name "Construction" regarding characteristics: Attributes are of central importance in ClassiX® because they make it possible to describe an object (material object, person object or similar) in all its characteristics without having to make changes to the source code. [[more] Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_construction" with the name "Construction" regarding calculation formulas: A formula is any arithmetic expression with operators, constants, variables and function calls. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_construction" with the name "Construction" regarding 5. release order items: With this module, sales order items are technically processed and released. A technical processing depends on the logistic identification of the part on the order item: If it is a production part, the order-specific production parts list can/should be generated for this part, if it is an order part, the requirement request can/should be made. For detailed information on use, please refer to the module documentation. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_construction" with the name "Construction" regarding time sheets: This module is used to create and maintain time sheets. Time sheets are particularly common in service industries, where it is necessary to record services for billing purposes with customers. Accordingly, the data to be entered is designed with regard to project-related billing or for the purpose of post-calculation. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use.

This is the description of the module "maintpaym" with the name "Recurring payment": The conditions "Recurring payments" are payment plans of a cyclical nature. They can be used for sales orders with the order type "maintenance contract" and control the billing cycle here. A maintenance payment can be of three different types: 1. cyclical lump sum payment 2. frame + expenditure 3. expenditure. This is the description of the functionality of the module "maintpaym" with the name "Recurring payment" regarding Use of recurrent payments in sales: Lump-sum payments that are too cyclical: Via the list "Maintenance invoices due", the lump-sum payments defined via these cyclical maintenance payments that are due by a date can be viewed and the invoice can be generated from them. The subsequent invoices are all generated on the customer order with the maintenance payment. To frame + expenditure: Maintenance includes a fixed frame, for example €2,000.00 per month, plus extra material and service costs. In this case a service provider group must also be defined in the order, on which a repetition cycle is entered. Below this service provider group, the items representing the framework of, for example, €2,000.00 are now entered. Sub-items can also be created with a fixed sum, for example "1 piece basic maintenance - fixed price €2,000.00". No due maintenance invoices can now be generated from this order; the invoices are generated for the subsequent orders generated via the "Due maintenance orders" list. In this case, these receive an invoice status. The invoices are created on these orders. The frame (e.g. €2,000.00) is saved as a fixed sum on the order and the created order group. On expenditure: There is no fixed framework, the orders are only settled via their follow-up orders. The maintenance order contains a cyclical service provider group without subitems. This point is very similar to point 2, except that the resulting order group does not receive any predefined subitems. Since maintenance payments are transaction-specific data, the master conditions only serve as a reference. When inserting the condition, for example in an order, the condition is copied here and therefore always inserted locally. This is the description of the functionality of the module "maintpaym" with the name "Recurring payment" regarding Use of recurring payments in purchasing: In purchasing, the condition "Recurring transaction" can be used, for example, in leasing, rental and maintenance contracts (purchasing cost unit) to define the regularity and amount of invoices. In this way, an incoming invoice can be checked automatically. This is the description of the functionality of the module "maintpaym" with the name "Recurring payment" regarding Input window: The input window is used to edit the maintenance payments, which serve as a template for documents, and local maintenance payments. This is the description of the functionality of the module "maintpaym" with the name "Recurring payment" regarding List window: Used to list the maintenance payments. This is the description of the functionality of the module "maintpaym" with the name "Recurring payment" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select a maintenance payment.

This is the description of the module "dnpycus" with the name "Customer down payment request": (see also: Business process "Down payments") Particularly in the case of contracts for work and services in the capital goods and plant construction sectors, it makes sense to demand advance payments as a guarantee for the fulfilment of the contract or as short or medium-term financing. This loan, which is granted interest-free by the debtor, is agreed upon in the order confirmation via the instalment payment conditions. This payment can now be requested by the customer via the down payment request module in accordance with § 632a BGB. If the customer does not comply with these down payments, he can be reminded together with his open items. The down payment request document is not an accounting document but only a memorandum item which reminds you of a down payment to be made. Therefore, the down payment requests in the customer open items represent a separate heading which does not change the balance. As the down payment represents a provisional payment for the entire work performance, it is to be offset against the final invoice. This is the description of the functionality of the module "dnpycus" with the name "Customer down payment request" regarding Functionality: On the one hand, down payments can be entered manually via the empty processing mask. For this purpose, the order for which the payment is to be requested must be selected and the corresponding data set.

This is the description of the module "jobrecrd" with the name "Time sheet": This module is one of several apps for recording and maintaining time sheets. Time sheets are particularly common in service industries, where it is necessary to record services for billing purposes. Accordingly, the data to be entered is designed with a view to project-related billing or for the purpose of post-calculation. This app allows you to enter time sheets individually, another app (time sheet (by the day)) is structured in such a way that you first enter the daily work/attendance time and then record the hours worked during this time - for different cost centres/cost units - as expenses. This is the description of the functionality of the module "jobrecrd" with the name "Time sheet" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain time sheets. With the "New" button you can create a new, empty timesheet. The record that was previously displayed is closed without saving. With the "Save" button in the toolbar you save your entries. With the "OK + New" button in the status bar the timesheet is saved and made space for a new, empty timesheet. With the "OK + close" button the time sheet is saved and the input window is closed. If you want to discard the changes you have made, close the screen and the changes will not be saved. The "Delete" button deletes the current timesheet object and closes the mask. The "" button for service opens an overview of the different service items which you can select with a double click. Then enter the number of hours you have spent on the article. With the "" button for cost units you can assign an order number to the effort and in the field 'Description' you can make further remarks. To insert a predecessor to the time sheet (e.g. orders, technical enquiries etc.) you can use the corresponding "" button. Alternatively you can click with the right mouse button in the "predecessor" field. As a third possibility it is also allowed to drag and drop a predecessor from another open window into the "predecessor" field. When a timesheet is generated automatically, the predecessor(s) are set automatically. Time sheets can also be generated from an order, a production bill of materials or the technical release window. In addition to the predecessor, the employee and the cost unit are then also set. To get to a "predecessor" you can double click on it or, after selecting the object, press the right mouse button and select "Edit". To remove a predecessor, right-click on it and select the menu item "Remove If, for example, you have worked several days for a cost unit, you can open the original document in the list window by double-clicking on it and copy it with "Copy saved timesheet". reproduce. If an hour entry has been assigned to a service provider group as a successor, the possibly booked planned time of the service provider group is reduced by the time logged off. Thus, the capacity utilisation shows exactly what is still open or already logged off in terms of planned time. Even if the time recording is created for a work order or service sub-item of the service provider group, the planned time of the service provider group is reduced as a result. All collected times therefore converge in the superordinate service provider group and can be found here on the processing screen under "already logged off:". When an offer is transferred to an order, all hourly records and work orders of the offer items are moved to the newly created order items.

This is the description of the module "jobsched" with the name "Work plan": Work plans describe the work steps that must be carried out to produce a manufacturing part. A work plan consists of work sequences, which in turn may have their own work plans. Each sequence of operations describes which workstations and which machines are required for the production of the part and for how long. The basic heading includes an operation, a work station and a machine, and the times required for production are recorded. A variant item is a conditional list of basic headings. When exploding the routing, the (single) item whose condition is the first to be fulfilled is used. This is the description of the functionality of the module "jobsched" with the name "Work plan" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain work plans. You can select a task list by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If several task lists with the number exist, the selection window is displayed and you can select the desired task list. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". If you create a new work plan, you must first save it before you can add work sequences. The creation date and user are preset and can be changed. A work plan consists of one or more items, which can be structured differently: The single item contains a resource (work centre, work group, machine, supplier) which is required in the specified (constant or calculated) quantity. If a supplier was specified as a resource on the routing item, this is referred to as an external work sequence(extended workbench). This means that the work defined using this sequence is not carried out by the company itself, but is ordered from the supplier specified in the resource. For more information, see Extended Workbench - External Sequences. Since routings themselves are only assigned to the part to be produced (the part to be finished, e.g. water pump), but the purchase order for the external work must be created via another part or unit of activity (e.g. unit of activity galvanising), the order article via which the external work is ordered can also be specified on the work sequence. An external work sequence therefore contains the following data, which makes it an external work sequence: A variant item is a conditional list of basic headings. When exploding the routing, the (single) item whose condition is the first to be fulfilled is used. You can change the order of the work plan sequences with "up" and "down" arrow buttons. To do this select a position and then move it up / down. The new sequence is automatically saved. Before you use a routing (which contains conditional items or calculated/conditional time specifications), you should test it (Test Resolution). This is the description of the functionality of the module "jobsched" with the name "Work plan" regarding List window: Used to list the work plans. This is the description of the functionality of the module "jobsched" with the name "Work plan" regarding Work plan positions (across different work plans): In this window the positions of the previously selected task lists are displayed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "jobsched" with the name "Work plan" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select a task list. This is the description of the functionality of the module "jobsched" with the name "Work plan" regarding Option window: All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed with the "OK" button. This is the description of the functionality of the module "jobsched" with the name "Work plan" regarding Work plan items (search results): If a search was carried out using set attributes, the positions to which the search applied are displayed here. A search for attributes applies if the subitem itself has the attribute you are looking for in any specified form, or if the subitem has a formula or conditional table as a quantity that contains this characteristic. For quantities as formulas or conditional values, the value of the characteristic is never checked. This means that if you search for LENGTH=34mm, a BOM/routing item is not displayed, even if it contains a quantity table with an entry LENGTH=34mm. Likewise, conditional BOM/routing items whose condition exactly matches the searched expression are not found. Only if this position also has the fixed attribute LENGTH=34mm, it will be found. So if you want to search all conditional entries and formulas for an attribute, you have to use the search on "available". A double click on an entry opens the editing mask of the position.

This is the description of the module "qm_rates_qm" with the name "Conversion tables object (CX_RATE_TABLE)": With rate tables you can test the automatic conversion between self-defined units. At the top of the window is a list containing the Current Units Conversion Table. The units can be edited by double-clicking on them or they can be created or deleted with the buttons 'Add Unit' and 'Remove Unit'. In the lower part of the window you can now convert between the units. To convert directly from one unit to another the button 'UnitConvert' is available. However, this button also requires the existence of a direct conversion rule for the units in question, otherwise the result is zero. To convert, enter the number and unit of the initial value into the field 'x'. In the field 'y' the target unit. To convert click the button. To convert over the whole table with several rules, use the button 'UnitCrossConvert'. Otherwise you proceed exactly as above. If UnitCrossConvert is not able to perform the conversion successfully (due to missing rules in the table), a display of the way the function has taken over the rules of the table appears in the window 'Trace'. To use the arithmetic functions (the buttons '+' '-' '*' '/') the table must first be registered in the system with the button 'Register table'. Now you can enter any values and units in the fields 'x' and 'y' and calculate. To make changes to the table again or just to convert it you have to log off the table with the button 'Log off table'. The field 'Rest' shows both the remainder of the conversion process and the remainder of the arithmetic functions. With the button 'ConvertIntoSmallest' a vector with the values and units from the fields 'x' and 'y' is created and it is tried to break everything down to the smallest possible unit of the table. The result then appears in the corresponding field, if no way is found the function returns zero. The menu item 'Autotest' starts a run through various conversion and calculation operations. The results are displayed in the 'Trace' window. Under the menu 'Examples' various sample numbers can be entered into the operand fields.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_ReengineeringBOM" with the name "Conversion parts lists" regarding Conversion parts list (as a recurring process): In the case of certain, recurring, identical customer enquiries, it can make sense to produce small series of these requested parts and to keep them in stock. If this part is then requested by the customer, it can be taken directly from the warehouse and dispatched. If the customer's order differs only slightly from the stock-guided part, the stock-guided part can in some cases be converted to the desired part; e.g. the motor should have a higher power. A further, additional conversion parts list can be created for each part. This conversion parts list first contains the finished part which is to be converted. The next item on the parts list is then the part(s) that can be optionally replaced and marked with the check mark "Conversion part". By this you get a negative quantity in the list of the parts list items (only in the list view, the quantity remains positive!), see picture: The new part can also be added to the master bill of materials, but can also be added later in the exploded production bill of materials. Since the new part, which has already been entered in this example, has no fixed characteristic values (it is a variant part), the order attributes control which motor is actually to be installed instead of the 1.3KW motor. In the customer order the pump is now pulled in and stamped with the desired motor power, namely 2.7kW: On the technical release mask, the bill of material is now selected and exploded, but now the special bill of material PU_Umbau: In the exploded parts list the part to be removed is now marked: After creating the parts request (Gozintograph), the dispositions can be scheduled and checked for availability. The so-called back putaway parts are not included in the time chain, but are always scheduled for the completion date of the production order, because only then it is ensured that this part will be available again. If the part should or can no longer be stored after dismantling because it is broken or has gone missing during dismantling, the main disposition type on the part request position must be changed to "no disposition". The costs for this part are then debited to the cost object. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_ReengineeringBOM" with the name "Conversion parts lists" regarding Conversion parts list (as a one-off operation): In contrast to the recurring conversion of small series, it can also occur more frequently that conversions have to be carried out once. In this case it is unfavourable to create a master bill of material for each of these operations. For this reason it can be useful to create an empty bill of material "CONVERSION", which can be selected as a special bill of material as described above. After exploding this BOM, the production BOM only consists of the BOM header, which is displayed in red because no sub-items have been exploded. The next step is now to insert the part to be converted, which should be stocked. Then the part to be dismantled and the replacement part must be added. The part to be dismantled must be marked accordingly in the parts list item. So the steps that have been taken above in the master bill of materials are done directly in the production bill of materials. In this way, the special bill of materials can be used for any parts. After the production parts list has been completely defined as a conversion parts list, you can continue with the disposition as described above.

6. Is there a limit to the number of times a part can be converted using the "Conversion parts lists" module?
7. Can I convert a part that is not currently stocked? If so, how do I handle the inventory management for that part?
8. How does the "Conversion parts lists" module affect the Bill of Materials (BOM) and the Production BOM?
9. Can I use the "Conversion parts lists" module to convert parts that are not listed in the master bill of materials?
10. Are there any specific rules or constraints that need to be followed when converting parts using the "Conversion parts lists" module?

This is the description of the module "provsing" with the name "Provided parts list entry": A parts-to-be-provided list consists of individual parts-to-be-provided. This module is used to record these parts to be provided, which must be provided to the supplier when ordering a part. The reference quantity is always related to 1 unit of the order part. So if 3 metres are entered as the quantity in the part to be provided, 3 metres always applies per unit of the ordered part. So if 3 parts are ordered, the quantity provided is 9 metres. It is not dependent on the standard order quantity!. This is the description of the functionality of the module "provsing" with the name "Provided parts list entry" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain parts to be provided. In addition to the part, the quantity and the characteristics, you can also set various options here as to how the item is to be exploded when creating a production parts list. The second tab "Document directory references" can also be used to link the item to document directories. A document could thus serve as an installation drawing, for example.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "provsing" module with the name "Provided parts list entry":

This is the description of the module "puroitem" with the name "Order item": General Framework order (blanket order) Subsequent connection BA <--> BE Order type: Subsequent connection order item -> delivery schedule line (requestor customer requirement) Determination of prices Calculation of the price conditions Adopt order item price as a supplier-specific price Order text field Order number. This is the description of the functionality of the module "puroitem" with the name "Order item" regarding General: A part to be ordered and corresponding order data and conditions are recorded on an order item. An order item basically consists of one or more delivery schedule lines; details such as quantity, date and others are only given on individual delivery schedule lines. If a provision is required for the order item, a note is displayed next to the order type: ATTENTION: PROVISION. Next to this note a button "Beistellungen" appears, which opens the attached provisions. This is the description of the functionality of the module "puroitem" with the name "Order item" regarding Framework order (blanket order): An order item can be configured for subsequent call-off (blanket order):. This is the description of the functionality of the module "puroitem" with the name "Order item" regarding Order text field, note for supplier or recipient.: The order text field is blocked for blanket orders. This is because the system checks during extension whether the description of the blanket order and that of the part or requirement request to be inserted are the same. If this is not the case, the blanket order is not extended, because otherwise the description from the requisition would not be adopted. If you want to tell the supplier or the recipient something, there are the fields Note for supplier and Note for recipient, the view can be switched by clicking the corresponding button. These fields should be used especially if the actual order text of a part from the parts master, i.e. not e.g. a text article, is not sufficient or has to be supplemented for a special reason! If the actual order text is never sufficient or always has to be supplemented by the same addition, then this should be corrected in the master data or the supplier agreement. If you now have an open blanket order in the system and want to change the order text in the order item, you will receive a warning message in the order item which explains this difference and asks whether the now changed order text in the order item should be adopted in the blanket order!. This is the description of the functionality of the module "puroitem" with the name "Order item" regarding Subsequently combine an open requirement request item with an open delivery schedule line: If a requirement request item and a delivery schedule line from a purchase order item are created individually in the system, whereby they both belong to one business transaction, then such two items can be linked in a document chain: the requirement request item is to be dragged and dropped onto the delivery schedule line. Requirements: - exactly one requirement request item may be included - the delivery schedule must not have a preceding document - the requisition item should be open (not yet completely ordered) - Parts on the requisition item and the order item should be the same. This is the description of the functionality of the module "puroitem" with the name "Order item" regarding Subsequent connection order item -> delivery schedule (requester: customer requirement)-: There are four possible connection types between order items and delivery schedules:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "puroitem" with the name "Order item" regarding Determination of prices: The procedure for price determination for order items is as follows. The price found first is drawn into the order: (Macro GetItemSupplier in purcoedt.mod fetches suppliers, puroiedt fetches a price matching the supplier) 1. price agreements of the purchase contract selected in the order header 2. supply agreements of the A-supplier 3. last price of the part with the last supplier 4. first found delivery agreement of the ordered article 5. price from order article roll (standard price) 6. price from requirement request item If price 0 is drawn by one of these steps, the price is taken from the requirement request item or the previous order. The last price used is stored in the selected supplier's movement monitors. All discounts and surcharges are taken into account. The prices from the orders are processed in the following areas: 1. goods receipt 2. average price calculation 3. stock statistics (determination of the stock value) The goods receipt passes on the price received from the order to the other departments. Redetermination of the price If the order item consists of only one delivery schedule line, the price is determined anew each time it is saved and checked to see whether it has changed (e.g. manual entry). However, if the order consists of several delivery schedule lines, the price will only be redetermined after saving the processed delivery schedule line. This happens because the price often only changes when the number of items in the delivery schedule line is changed. If the attribute values are changed, the price is calculated anew each time.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "puroitem" with the name "Order item" regarding Calculation of price conditions on order items and delivery schedules: There are two ways to provide order items with conditions. 1- You save the conditions directly in the order item. Then, after determining the delivery schedule line prices, the condition is offset against the result. 2- you save the conditions in the delivery schedule itself. In this way, valid conditions can be saved for each delivery schedule line, which have no influence on other delivery schedule lines. The result of the following conversions is stored in the slot gross.value. This is then used for further processing in the goods receipts and average value calculation. Absolute conditions: It should also be noted that absolute conditions (-100€) also affect the unit price. It is therefore multiplied, like all other conditions in the items, by the quantity stored for the item. Determination of the prices of the individual delivery schedules with absolute surcharges/discounts (e.g. in order status list and calculation of the values in average value calculation and stock value calculation) Data that were defined in delivery schedules are shown in yellow. Data that were defined in order items are shown in blue. Data that were defined in the order header are shown in green. Conditions that originate from higher-level data records and have been split are shown in italics. Definitions of the slots: total.value: In total.value the values from the current position including conditions and all their big.value: This price is the basis for all subsequent calculations and display forms in which the The allocation of conditions from the purchase order items to the delivery schedule lines is carried out proportionally by the quantities specified in the delivery schedule lines to the total quantity of the purchase order item. Further examples are listedin this Excel file. Conditions from the order header are divided up proportionally based on the price volume of the order items. The intermediate price marked in grey is used to determine these prices. These proportions are then divided up among the delivery schedule lines in the same way as conditions on order items. Explanation of the calculation of the order header condition to be split using the above example: Total surcharge on order header: 1000€ 1st order item: 1000€/14.160€*4.160€ = 293,79€ (surcharge/total volume of order*total volume of order item) 1. delivery schedule of the first order item: 293,79€/40*10 = 73,45€ (surcharge/total quantity order item*quantity to 2. delivery schedule of the first order item: 293,79€/40*30 = 220,34€ (surcharge/total quantity order item*quantity to 2nd order item: 1000€/14.160€*10.000€ = 706,21€ 1. delivery schedule of the second order item: 706,21€/10.000*10.000=706,21 Total volume of the surcharge: 706,21€ + 73,45€ + 220,34€ = 1000,00€ Determining the total price of the order (in the order item window):. This is the description of the functionality of the module "puroitem" with the name "Order item" regarding Adopt order item price as a supplier-specific price: With the toolbar button the price from the order item is stored as a supplier-specific price on the order item (only if a supplier is on the order and a parts order reel is available). If the order item has imputed conditions (discount, surcharge, freight etc.), the question is asked whether the price should be adopted with such conditions or without. If a vendor-specific price for the order item already exists and is "complex" (i.e. the price is a complex price with more than one pricing element or is defined as a conditional table or function), then such a price cannot be overwritten. This is the description of the functionality of the module "puroitem" with the name "Order item" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain order items. Via 'Part' you select the corresponding part from the order item list that opens. You can then insert the supplier's order number and revise the order text as required. In the field 'Delivery schedule' via 'Insert' you can enter the order quantity and your desired date. It is also possible to divide the order quantities and specify your desired date for the individual quantities, e.g. 10 pieces as quickly as possible, rest on call. In the fields 'Comment' and 'Recipient' you can add comments to your order In the lower part of the mask you can now enter the price of your order items and any discounts to be granted. With 'OK' you save the order item. The system assigns an item number and copies the item into the order. This is the description of the functionality of the module "puroitem" with the name "Order item" regarding Quick order window: This window is used to quickly enter order items that do not have a predecessor, i.e. for cost centre orders. In comparison to normal order processing, only the essential order information is therefore recorded. This enables a fast entry of orders, e.g. in case of a JIT parts request for a production order by the production itself. Furthermore, JIT order faxes can be used for the creation of JIT order faxes. However, it is still possible to process the order via the normal order processing at any time. During the fast entry of a new order, the logged in employee is suggested as the processor of the order. First of all, a supplier should now be selected who is to receive the order. The supplier address and the fax number are then transferred. A later redefinition of the supplier is only possible via the normal order mask. This is the description of the functionality of the module "puroitem" with the name "Order item" regarding Position data: This window is used to maintain the order item data.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "puroitem" with the name "Order item" regarding Grouped positions: It is possible to check via the order status list or the order header using a toolbar button (Check price summary) whether different order items of the same variant parts with different characteristics can be combined and thus a quantity discount can be deducted from the price tables. This is possible if the attributes required for the price tables of the order prices are the same for all of these variant parts which are actually differently marked. The corrected prices can then be applied to the order items after viewing them in a results window. This is the description of the functionality of the module "puroitem" with the name "Order item" regarding Extend order process 2 - AppendPurchaseOrderItems: {img type="fileId" fileId="424" thumb="box" width="100%"} Interface description: CX_PURCHASE_ORDER (Vector, Collection, Object CX_CONTAINER) SendMsg(APPEND_PURCHASE_ORDER_ITEMS) In the Vector there are edited data in the order header editing module. The message APPEND_PURCHASE_ORDER_ITEMS must not be called individually. If an order is to be extended by items, it is necessary to call up the message APPEND_PURCHASE_ORDER. AppendPurchaseOrderItems: The transferred order is held in the variable purchaseOrder. Then all further objects are passed through: First of all, all information of the object to be created that is available up to this point is plugged (macro PlugWithPredecessor) and an attempt is made to resolve any existing variant part. The (un)resolved part is kept in the variable orderItem, which is used for further work. Now an order item is searched for in the transferred order that has the same part (macro FindPurchaseOrderItem). If such an item is found, this order item is called with EditObject, otherwise a new one is created. A new delivery schedule is later created on this order item. For this purpose, the quantity to be ordered must first be determined. In some containers passed to the AppendPurchaseOrderItems macro, a quantity is already present. However, this quantity is now converted by the macro GetAmountToOrder using the lot sizes. If there was no quantity in the container, the standard quantity is taken from the order item roll. But first of all it is checked again whether the order item found is a blanket order (macro CheckCallForwardTransaction). If not, all relevant data from the preceding document is transferred to the new order item and this is created/saved by SaveObject. If an order item with the same part has already been found, this information is not overwritten. A SaveObject is now not necessary. The macro CreateSubItem, to which the preceding document and the quantity to be ordered is transferred, now creates a delivery schedule line with the correct quantity and at the same time correctly reposts the preceding document. Here the predecessor is also linked to the new transaction. GetBasePurchasePrice: Once the delivery schedule has been created, you can search for the price that matches the supplier you may have entered. A TRUE or a FALSE is passed to this macro, which controls in the macro where the required information, which must be plugged, is taken from. The FindPurchasePrice macro is then used to retrieve the supply agreement between supplier and part and to transfer it to the GetPriceOfLogCube macro. If the macro GetPriceOfLogCube returns no price or an empty price, the standard price is taken from the order item role and kept in the variable tmpPriceDiscount by the macro AppendToTmpPriceDiscount. GetPriceOfLogCube: This macro determines the price from the transferred LogCube. If there is no price or if it is zero, the system searches for the price of the last movement monitor of this supplier and returns it if found. AppendToTmpPriceDiscount: This macro builds a valid price chain (CX_PRICE_DISCOUNT with subCharges) on the basis of one or more objects transferred in succession. Here all main chain links are retained, but their individual subCharges are resolved by a call to Amount(). If these would also be taken over, the final result would be wrong, because the sub-discounts on a main chain link already refer to the discount and not to the main price. If, for example, a chain link looks like this: +150€-10% then the -10% refers to the extra 150€ which in the end equals +135€. For further explanations of the price chains, see here. SaveConditions: The previously created price chain tmpPriceDiscount is divided into conditions. For each price chain link, a condition is created for the order item object.
Sure! Based on the provided module description, here are some realistic questions that an unfamiliar user might ask about the "puroitem" module and its functionality:

This is the description of the module "restrict" with the name "Restriction table": The value range of an attribute can be limited via the Constraint data field of the attributes. However, there are also cases in which the values of two or more attributes are mutually exclusive or restricted. These constraints can be defined via the restriction table. A restriction table is a conditional table. The results of the conditions are the values "allowed", "warning" or "not allowed". A combination of attribute values is invalid according to the restriction table if it returns "Not allowed" as a result. Therefore it is also valid if it does not return a result. Warning should be used for values that are still tolerable but the user should have the final decision. As a rule, only the combinations and warnings that are not permitted are stored in the restrictions table. However, if the number of permitted combinations is smaller than the number of non-permitted combinations, the permitted combinations can also be entered. In this case, the conditional table must then end with a non-permitted condition, which always applies (an empty condition for example). Restriction tables can be created for variant parts (via the characteristics bar) or sales item roles. Restriction tables for variant parts describe impossible combinations of characteristics. Restriction tables for sales article roles describe attribute combinations in which a sales article may not be sold. Restriction tables for variant parts are checked at the following events: Testing the creation of a gozintograph (warning message) Creation of a gozintograph (abort message) Preparation of a preliminary costing Sales release of an order item Posting an order (red -> green traffic light) if the order item has not yet been delivered Restriction tables for sales article rolls are checked in the following events: Sales release of an order item Posting an order (red -> green traffic light) if the order item has not yet been delivered. This is the description of the functionality of the module "restrict" with the name "Restriction table" regarding Restriction table: This window is used to maintain the restriction tables.

This is the description of the module "qm_itempattern_qm" with the name "Variant parts (CX_ITEM_PATTERN)": This test is intended to check the resolution of a variant part into its subparts. Each time the window is opened, a variant part is created with a list of characteristics with the characteristics POWER_MOTOR, NUMBER OF ROTATION and DIAMETER. Also 2 lower parts with different characteristics. For testing, a CX_ALLOCATION_TXN is created with an AttributeSet, which is plugged to the resolution. Here you can make the desired test settings and with a click on "Test resolution" you can check if the correct subpart is found by the function "Item()" called in the test. The determined part is then marked in the upper list. You could now manually check whether a characteristic is expected in the plug space even if this characteristic is preset in the characteristic bar of the variant part and the type is not set to "Without value specification". The result is: It is still expected. (An error message appears stating that DemandVariables may only be called with a registered message).

This is the description of the module "qmbase" with the name "Test framework": This app (hereinafter also referred to as QM app ) is part of the CyberEnterprise quality management. Using Excel files with a specific structure, manual entries by users can be simulated and the results of these entries can be checked automatically. (In the classic evaluation system test framework Excel files are available in the directory .\Projects\TestFrameworks\Data\). The format of these Excel files is as follows: #Flags #Comment #ExecuteString #CommandString #Variable Test access expressions Flags (capitalisation also permitted) Flags Description rem; comments a line from break; leads to the termination of the processing sleep; following lines are not executed until the next "wakeup;" flag. This is an easy way to comment out lines in a test framework. wakeup; the following lines are executed again. load; other test frameworks can be included, for example to create parts However, it is not intended to link several evaluations to each other, as no evaluation files are written and no errors are logged when the flag "load" is set. goto:line number:condition goto statement: The syntax looks like this: goto:19:var 3 < The first part "goto" defines the GoTo statement. Then follows the line number to which the jump is to be made and the last part (e.g. var 3 <, i.e. the value of a previously defined variable var should be less than 3) defines the condition under which the jump label is approached. Only if this condition returns TRUE the GOTO instruction is executed to avoid endless loops. idle(waiting time); The processing of the test framework is paused by the waiting time in ms. The system is idle during this waiting time. This allows the behaviour of the system when waiting for user input to be simulated. Comment: Here you can enter descriptive information about the line. ExecuteString (called column 1 below): The string specified here is placed on the stack as a string. The specifications made here are only used for the purpose of being able to execute the TEST_ or EXEC_ Message in a target module to be executed by Execute. If any TEST_ or EXEC_ is missing message is missing, the entries in this column do not lead to a result. (Note: All AppsWarehouse Apps "understand" a TEST_ or EXEC_ message, which only allows the command "Execute" to be executed in the respective App). CommandString (named column 2 below): The string specified here is executed directly in the QM App per Execute. Any string specified in column 1 is processed accordingly as a string stack entry. (Examples are listed below) Variable (named column 3 below): With the message QM_ROW_EXECUTED, a stack entry that exists there can be sent back to the QM app using the ExecuteString and its processing in the target module. This stack entry is then saved in the variable specified in this column. Test access expressions: Access expressions can be specified starting from this column. The variables previously defined in the QM App serve as starting points for the access expressions. These access expressions are used to determine the values via the variables, which are then compared with the values stored in the Excel file in the lines. If these values do not match, an error message is displayed. syntax: Access printout Example: purchaseOrder supplier.uniqueID The test file must not contain any blank lines! Therefore, please make sure to always write REM; in the first column(#Flags) of the desired empty lines. Then it will work without the last line not being executed. A few hints for use and examples: Let's assume we want to create a requirement request and use it to create an order. This is how you proceed in the following rough steps: Create empty requirement coverage request Save requirements request via Save button Write part number in requisition item (which opens automatically when the header is saved) and send SELECT message to part number field Change quantity and save position via Save button Book header document Return variable of the requirement request item to our QM App Create order via usual message The following problems need to be solved: How do I send a variable back to the QM App? How do I send my requirement request variable from the QM app to another app via the test message, which only has one execute parameter? and the solutions: SendMsg(QM_ROW_EXECUTED) in column 1, SendMsg(TEST_PURCHASE_REQUISITION_ITEM) in column 2 and the target variable in which we want to hold this position in the QM App, i.e. purchaseRequisitionItem in column 3. The QM app receives this response message and always stores it in the same temporary variable. Then the object is transferred from the temporary variable to the desired variable. The following execution sequence leads to the result, if, for example, the requirement coverage request item is to be drawn into the order as a predecessor: Column 1: Widget(EditWin, predecessors) SendMsg(PURCHASE_REQUISITION_ITEM_SELECTED, DIRECT) Column 2: purchaseRequisitionItem Swap SendMsg(TEST_PURCHASE_ORDER_ITEM) The swap places the variable purchaseRequisitionItem behind the string to be executed, resulting in the following statement: purchaseRequisitionItem "Widget(EditWin, predecessors) SendMsg(PURCHASE_REQUISITION_ITEM_SELECTED, DIRECT)" SendMsg(TEST_PURCHASE_REQUISITION_ITEM) When the test message is triggered, there are therefore 2 parameters on the stack: our requisition request position and on the TOP the string to be executed in the target app. At least one blank file and one fully functioning "example" test file is checked in at each branch. You can find these test files in the directory: \AppsWH\\\data\QS To use the BREAK; and the REM; instruction the following hionweis: This instruction always refers exactly to the beginning of the corresponding line: That means, just as you comment out the line with REM; you terminate with BREAK; also exactly BEFORE executing this line! The line containing the BREAK; is therefore no longer executed. Another tip: Window test messages If a procedure is to be executed via EXEC message, which contains access to widgets written without the leading EditWin, e.g. GetObject(, predecessors), a local test message can be created according to the following scheme: First part: test message (TEST_ORDER), second part window name: (EDIT_WIN) = TEST_ORDER_EDIT_WIN Another test message is defined in the app that receives the test message: Msg(TEST_ORDER_EDIT_WIN) Then ONLY in the action list of the window (here EditWin) this message is intercepted and only supplemented by an Execute: TEST_ORDER_EDIT_WIN: Execute Now you can call procedures directly from the window by Execute without having to add EditWin (the context) in all procedures, which would sometimes even be wrong (if the procedure is called from different windows!). However, the call of the message must then look a little different: Column 1: "SaveObject" SendMsg(TEST_ORDER_EDIT_WIN) Column 2: SendMsg(TEST_ORDER) The string to be executed in the window test message must be placed in inverted commas again, otherwise it would already be executed by the first execute (TEST_ORDER). With inverted commas, it is treated as a string and (without inverted commas) loaded onto the stack. Since the SendMsg(TEST_ORDER_EDIT_WIN) statement is not in the stack, this statement is executed and sends the previously loaded string as the next execution command to the window test message. Since not every app needs such a message, and this message should not trigger the app under any circumstances (otherwise there would probably be a lot of duplicate test executions, because customer derivations of these apps might still be created) and there should only be one defined interface to an app, this message should be added according to this scheme if necessary. Common errors that occur when creating a test file: LAZY_CREATOR: If an item of a document is held in a variable in the test file and this variable is used in a column to evaluate a slot or similar, the error message "Object not yet created" appears, although this item has already been linked to the header document. As the entire test process is carried out in one main transaction throughout the entire test suite, this LazyCreator is not converted into a persistent object. This must be done in the test file via the OBJECT Manager: position header document GetManager(OBJECT) Call(Instantiate) -> Variable. It is very important that the result of the instantiate is saved back into the variable of the position. Otherwise the old variable pointer still points to the LAZY_CREATOR. Example: orderItem order GetManager(OBJECT) Call(Instantiate) -> orderItem If orderItem is used in a column, this variable must be named differently as long as it still contains the LazyCreator. Because as long as it still points to the LazyCreator, attempts in columns such as orderItem::sales.pricePer will fail with an error message in the QM App. ALSO: Rename variable orderItem to orderItemTmp first and save it to the variable orderItem only after the Instantiate. Then also the column can be evaluated reasonably. Calling several test frameworks Call from the QM App: - Multiple selection of files - Select a folder to run all tests in it Call with a batch file: The exact path of the desired files and folders is stored in variables and assembled into a large string. Extract of a sample file: The spaces in the file names must be replaced with "***": SET STRING_1=%CX_QS_PATH%\Demo\Test file***Sample name1***-***Demo.xls (Test file Sample name1 - Demo.xls) SET STRING_2=%CX_QS_PATH%\Demo\Testdatei***Mustername2***-***Demo.xls SET STRING_3=%CX_OS_PATH%\Demo\validity The individual character strings are combined into one and are separated by "###": SET CX_ALL_TESTS=%STRING_1click="javascript:toggle_dynamic_var("###");" title="Click to edit dynamic variable: ###">No value assignedSTRING_2Novalue assignedSTRING_3% The call of the file which starts the tests with the variable CX_ALL_TESTS as the transfer parameter: call %CX_ROOTDIR%\projects\Start_Testframework.bat %CX_ALL_TESTS% General information: The selected files and folders are assembled into a string and used as transfer parameters for the calling batch file. In this file, the character string is saved as the environment variable "CX_TESTFRAMEWORKS". A new CyberEnterprise instance is opened, which reads the character string from the environment variable to call the first test. This test is removed from the string and when it is finished, the batch file is called again, with the new string as the transfer parameter. Thus the test frameworks run one after the other in a separate CyberEnterprise instance. If errors occur, error files are generated, but without the usual request to change to the test directory. 
Sure! I'll gladly assist you with generating realistic questions based on the given module description. Please note that I will only ask questions based solely on the provided module description and refrain from asking external knowledge or requiring additional information.

Here's my first question:

What is the primary purpose of the "qmbase" module, as described in the provided module description?

This is the description of the module "validity" with the name "Validity": With this module the temporal validity of an object can be set. This time validity window is compared with the validity date specified in the system during each processing with this object. If an object is therefore "invalid", it is not displayed in lists by default, for example, or access to data of this object is no longer possible. In the business environment, data in the manner described above are very often limited in time (e.g. customer no longer exists, product is no longer to be sold), but as a rule one piece of information is only replaced by another piece of information that is "newer" in time: the value added tax rate is increased from 1.1., a price table changes from a certain date, etc. In these cases it is possible to make a temporal concatenation of information or objects. This is made possible by the "Exchange objects" box. This box contains all the objects that are in a logical chronological order; depending on their validity, one object automatically replaces the other. It does not matter which object you are currently standing at, you will always receive the correct information at the right time. This is the description of the functionality of the module "validity" with the name "Validity" regarding Functionality: A validity period can be specified in three different ways: In order to carry out a temporal concatenation of objects, the objects in question must be dragged and dropped into the "Exchange objects" box. Then press the OK button. This is the description of the functionality of the module "validity" with the name "Validity" regarding Rules/exceptions: The following list specifies a number of rules or exceptions for which the validity cannot be set, or what happens if the validity of an object is restricted:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "validity" with the name "Validity" regarding Validity of parts and parts lists: For different scenarios that lead to the invalidity of a part, it may be useful to define different procedures for each:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "validity" with the name "Validity" regarding Display - access options in list windows: The following options are available to specify the validity of an object as a search criterion. The radio buttons result in 4 possible combinations, which are described below. Only 1 radio button from each group can be selected at any one time, as they are conditional. {img type="fileId" fileId="442" thumb="box" width="100%"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module "validity" with the name "Validity" regarding With exchange object & valid objects: (default setting): All valid objects are displayed. If an object is invalid and has a valid exchange object, the exchange object is displayed. Invalid objects are not accessible here. This is the description of the functionality of the module "validity" with the name "Validity" regarding With exchange object & all objects:: Display of all valid objects and all invalid objects that do not have a valid exchange object. It is not possible to access the original object if it has a valid exchange object at the time of the search. In this case the exchange object is always found. For invalid objects with invalid exchange objects, the original object is displayed. If this setting is selected, a column is added to the list which shows the validity of the objects. This is the description of the functionality of the module "validity" with the name "Validity" regarding Without exchange object & valid objects:: The searched object must be valid at the time of the search to be found. If it is invalid and has a valid exchange object, the exchange object is ignored. This is the description of the functionality of the module "validity" with the name "Validity" regarding Without exchange object & all objects:: The searched object must be valid at the time of the search to be found. If it is invalid and has a valid exchange object, it will be ignored. If you are looking for an invalid object with a valid exchange object, the original invalid object will be displayed. If this setting is selected, 2 columns are added to the list. The column "validity" shows the validity of the objects, the other "exchange object" shows if invalid objects have valid exchange objects and shows their number. If no valid or no exchange object exists the column remains empty. This is the description of the functionality of the module "validity" with the name "Validity" regarding Examples:: Part 1 is valid and has no replacement object Part 1 is invalid and has no exchange object Part 1 is invalid and has valid exchange object Part 2 Part1 is invalid and has invalid exchange object Part2.

This is the description of the module "alocitem" with the name "Parts Use": This module displays all uses of a part in parts lists. By means of a filter, the user can choose whether he wants to see a usage of the part in order-specific production parts lists or in master parts lists. A further option is the display of a usage in sales parts lists. This includes the use of sales articles, spare parts or service units as individual parts in sales sets (not to be confused with the sales set role of a part). This module is intended as a technical aid. Related to this are the modules parts consumption (intended for use by logistics) and parts use (intended for use by service/sales). If you generally want to evaluate the use or non-use of a part in a certain period, you can do this by means of an inspection run. Validity and exchange objects It is also possible to indicate the use of the exchange objects for parts that become invalid and have one or more exchange objects. If the checkbox "Also consider exchange objects" is checked, every use of each exchange object is automatically displayed. By simple selection in the list of exchange objects it is possible to display the uses of individual exchange objects. A multiple selection is possible. If all objects are to be displayed again, either select all exchange objects or check the box "Also consider exchange objects". All entries will then lose their selections and all objects will be displayed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "alocitem" with the name "Parts Use" regarding Use of parts with exchange object: {img type="fileId" fileId="358" thumb="box" width="100%"} The parts list item points to part AS, which was valid until 29.11.2020. This part will be replaced by part AS2 from 30.11.2020. However, part AS2 itself has no connection to the BOM item, so that no entries would be displayed in the part usage without exchange objects. In order to be able to display the parts list nevertheless, the possibility was created to display the parts usage of the exchange objects in the parts usage (arrow from part AS2 to parts usage of part AS). {img type="fileId" fileId="360" thumb="box" width="100%"} In the parts usage, all exchange objects are listed in a list. By ticking the standard checkbox "Also consider exchange objects", the part usages of all exchange objects visible in this list are also displayed. The exchange objects in the list can also be selected individually; only the part uses for the selected objects are then displayed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "alocitem" with the name "Parts Use" regarding List window: When the display window is called up for the first time, the filter "Production master data" is set as standard. A double click on an entry in the list shows the occurrence(s) of the part in BOM items: if a part is used from several master BOM items, a list of these BOM items is displayed. A double click on one of these entries navigates directly to this master BOM item. If a usage is clicked from an order, the order-specific production parts list opens. The context menu for navigating can be called up from a list entry using the right mouse button: here too, the occurrence of the part in parts lists (analogous to double-clicking, see above) or the corresponding user of the parts list, i.e. the production role of a part, can be reached.
Sure! Here are some realistic questions that a user might ask when interacting with the "Parts Use" module, based on the provided description:

1. How do I view all uses of a specific part in the parts list?
2. Can I filter the parts list to show only uses of a particular part in order-specific production parts lists?
3. How do I display all uses of a part in sales parts lists?
4. What is the purpose of the "Also consider exchange objects" checkbox in the parts list?
5. How do I view the uses of individual exchange objects in the parts list?
6. Can I select multiple exchange objects at once to display their associated part uses?
7. How do I navigate to a specific master BOM item from the parts list?
8. What happens when I double-click on an entry in the parts list?
9. Can I access the context menu for a part use from the parts list?
10. How do I open the order-specific production parts list for a specific part use?

I hope these questions cover the main functionalities of the "Parts Use" module! Let me know if there's anything else I can assist with.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "finabook" with the name "Bookings financial accounting" regarding Document settings: In addition to the settings you can make for your respective posting session, general settings for the financial accounting document can be made depending on the posting type under the advanced settings of the document presettings. For example, the bank details, the address for a cheque or the e-mail address for the payment advice can be specified for individual suppliers for outgoing payments. This is the description of the functionality of the module "finabook" with the name "Bookings financial accounting" regarding OP Compensation: If a person booking is made, the OP account is automatically displayed after the account number is entered. From this view, you can then select any open items to be cleared ( Clear button). For security reasons, the balance of the open items selected in this way is not automatically transferred to the booking mask, but must be entered manually in the general ledger booking mask. If this manually entered amount is equal to the sum of the open items to be cleared without deduction, the entry is made immediately. If the amount is lower (or unequal), i.e. a deduction was made on payment, for example, this OP Compensation window opens for closer examination of the difference or for checking the distribution of the possible deductions to cost centres or cost units. This window also opens if the deduction was justified e.g. due to a discount granted. One clearing entry is displayed per control key. You can change the difference amount or the adjustment accounts by double-clicking or using the context menu (right mouse button). If lines with no amount remain in the list, these are omitted in the subsequent posting. A difference amount may, for example, differ from the "discount possible" amount if charges have reduced the payment amount. In this case, a new clearing entry can be created directly, which displays the fee amount (without a control key). (The original clearing entry must of course also be reduced by this amount). In the standard case, it is assumed that the clearing amount is a granted/drawn cash discount. However, if it is a clearing of open items with foreign currency, where the balance of the foreign currency amounts itself does not result in a difference, a clearing entry is created via the currency loss, profit accounts. This is the description of the functionality of the module "finabook" with the name "Bookings financial accounting" regarding context menu: The possible clearing entries automatically differentiated by the system according to control key and account assignment can be edited in this mask. This is the description of the functionality of the module "finabook" with the name "Bookings financial accounting" regarding Buttons: From a single open item account (customers, suppliers, employees, representatives) or from the listing of open items, foreign currency operations can be revalued. The open items selected for this task are listed in this window. In addition, the currency table can be selected and displayed in the middle area of the window, by means of which the revaluation is carried out. In the lower area of the window, the currency loss and profit account can be specified and other details for the transfer posting can be made.

This is the description of the module "cxDocumentIndex" with the name "Document master": Terms/Definitions File Location Printing documentsThe document master in ClassiX® offers the possibility to manage digital documents. An EDM system (Electronic Document Management), respectively a DMS(Document Management System) is already integrated in ClassiX®.The advantage of the integrated solution is the direct association of documents to receipts or master data. The drawings of an article can thus be maintained directly via the parts mask and the documents belonging to an order can be directly linked to the ClassiX order.The associations of the transaction data with the documents can be maintained via a separate editing mask, which can be called up via the document history module, for example. In the master data there is a tab "Documents" for this purpose, as for example in the parts mask. If this tab is not available on the processing mask, documents can be linked via the transaction folder or directly via the processing mask of the document entry.Both the master data and the transaction data can either refer directly to the documents or via a conditional table. A conditional table is useful, for example, if the documents of a variant part are managed and different versions should lead to different documents. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxDocumentIndex" with the name "Document master" regarding Type: The file location is the reference to the document. Three different reference options are available, from which one can be selected.

This is the description of the module "condcond" with the name "Conditional conditions": For more efficient entry of quotations/orders, customer-specific conditions can be stored in the customer role, which are automatically adopted when a quotation/order is created. Since this rule cannot be generalised to all conditions, it is possible to attach a condition to conditions. This is the description of the functionality of the module "condcond" with the name "Conditional conditions" regarding Functionality: After selection, the conditional condition is created directly and displayed in its own editing mask. The conditional entries are displayed in the list. An entry consists of the following information. First of all, each condition should be given a meaningful name so that another user knows what it is when he or she edits the condition. Next, the condition can/should be defined, which is evaluated when the condition is inserted into an order. Since defining this condition often requires more extensive knowledge than that of a normal user, standard conditions can be accepted as default conditions by clicking on the button Standard conditions. The list of conditions can of course be extended on request. Finally, a condition must be stored (inserted/created). This is done via the context menu of the condition field. Click the Save button to save the changes made. New conditional entries can be created and existing ones deleted via the context menu of the list. The arrows next to the list serve to move the conditional entries. Notes, explanations, examples If a conditional condition is created with several entries, the order/offer will contain a minimum of no condition and a maximum of one condition. If several conditions apply, the first condition with a correct condition is always taken over. Therefore it is also useful to be able to position the entries with the arrow buttons. If an entry has no condition, the condition is always considered true. Attention! The condition is evaluated each time the condition is inserted. If a condition is dependent on the order type, it should be set BEFORE the customer is selected. From a technical point of view, it is currently not possible to insert several conditions into one order using a conditional condition. Instead, it would be necessary to store several conditional conditions with the same conditions with the customer.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "paysepa" with the name "Payments (creditor) in the European data exchange format SEPA" regarding Creating bank data media in SEPA format: From this window, a bank data medium can be created for a payment document in financial accounting. To do this, enter the document number of the payment run (to be repeated) and the corresponding period. In the repeat run, you have the option of subsequently excluding payments by selection. Since the payments are already posted at this point, this should only be done in exceptional cases. You therefore require special access rights to this function and must then remember to maintain the excluded payments for accounting purposes. In the SEPA file format, a maximum of 140 characters can be output per individual payment to indicate the purpose of the payment (= open item). If the supplier has stored the own number, it is output in the first proof of use with "KD nnnn", then all paid documents are output with "NR nnnnn EURxxxxxxx,xx" (nnn = invoice or credit note number, xxx,xx the amount paid (discount is deducted)). If more than 5 open items are paid per payee, these will be divided into correspondingly cleared 1.00EUR payments: if, for example, the amount is 2.000,-€ for a total of 6 open items, the payee will receive a payment/payment statement with 1.999,-€ and 5 open items, as well as a payment/payment statement with 1.00€ and 1 open item.

This is the description of the module "metaobj" with the name "English:meta object": A meta object represents a group of identical or similar objects of an application solution. It is similar because different objects, for example of the same class "CX_CUSTOMER", can differ from each other by the number and type of data fields. Nevertheless, such "similar" objects are combined in the meta model to form a meta object "customer". This meta-object is then described by the totality of all possible data fields. Meta-Objects are created exclusively by the ObjectCrawler. This is the description of the functionality of the module "metaobj" with the name "English:meta object" regarding Identification of a meta-object: A meta-object is primarily identified by its type. The type is the class name (for example, CX_CUSTOMER) of the objects. A further identification feature is the specification of the main object. Main objects are objects that are registered in a RootEntryPoint-Collection (REP Collection) of the respective class type. Thus all main objects can be identified directly and assigned to the corresponding meta object. Thus, each customer object can be identified by specifying "type=CX_CUSTOMER and main object=yes". But now there are also slave objects in the database which are not in a REP collection and therefore are not main objects. These slave objects are referenced/defined/identified via their master. The master is itself a meta object and references/defines/identifies other meta objects as slave objects. This is to be distinguished because slave objects (can) have a different character in the application solution due to different assignments. This becomes clear with the example of the class CX_LINK_TXN. Objects of this class can be used as order items, delivery note items or any other document items. In order to identify an order item as a meta-object, the type (=CX_LINK_TXN), the identification main object (=no) and the specification of its master are necessary. The type of the master object is in this case CX_SALES_ORDER and e.g. in case of a delivery note item CX_DELIVERY_NOTE. The set of rules according to which the master object of a slave object is defined is stored in the ObjectCrawler. Some of the rules are listed below as examples: In addition to the normal slave objects, there are also the data cube objects (of type CX_DATA_CUBE / CX_LOG_CUBE), which are not defined by a master object but by their dimensions. As dimensions there are at least two master objects. A two-dimensional data cube is therefore identified by the fact that there are exactly two unique references (dimension 1 and dimension 2) to other meta objects. Exceptions are made for data cubes that represent monthly or annual accounts. Here there is a "correct" dimension and a dimension representing the time span ("year", "month"). This is the description of the functionality of the module "metaobj" with the name "English:meta object" regarding Input window: This window is used for the maintenance of . This is the description of the functionality of the module "metaobj" with the name "English:meta object" regarding List window: This window is used to list the meta objects.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_supply" with the name "Purchasing - processes" regarding incoming invoice / incoming credit notes: Via the menu item "Activities -> Purchasing -> Incoming invoices/incoming credit notes" you can enter incoming invoices. The basis for this is the assignment of the invoice items to the delivery schedule items so that the entry runs as automatically as possible. Then the invoice values and possibly the conditions that deviate from the purchase order have to be entered and the invoice has already been entered in the ClassiX® system. (incoming invoice document) The first audit took place at that time. If items in the item list are marked with a stop sign, these items cannot be released automatically, but are set to the status "to be checked" when the invoice is forwarded. Above all, however, he can also use the incoming invoice status window. Here the inspector can display his items to be inspected and also gets an immediate overview of the items which can be released immediately. If an item has three green checkmarks, the cause of the check is already solved by itself. (If, for example, a GR has been carried out, etc.) (Docu Incoming Invoice Status Window) Now that all items have been released, the incoming invoice header is also automatically released. The last step is the posting of the incoming invoices to the financial accounting. The invoice receipt book serves this purpose. In addition to the function of the selection window (selection of the invoices to be posted) and the statistics, the initial account assignment of the invoices can be changed manually. (Docu Incoming Invoice Book). This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_supply" with the name "Purchasing - processes" regarding 11. view order status: Via the menu item 'Evaluation - Purchasing - View order status', the window 'Order items (all)' opens.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_supply" with the name "Purchasing - processes" regarding incoming goods/direct delivery/interim storage: Docu goods receipt / direct delivery / intermediate storage Via the menu item 'Logistics -> Goods receipt' you can enter a new goods receipt. The basis for this is always a purchase order, so no goods receipt can be entered without a purchase order predecessor. On the one hand, the goods receipt serves to report the completion of a purchase order, which also removes it from the MRP account, but on the other hand, it also serves to provide or store the goods. Thus, the goods receipt is also a central point in the MRP chain. A direct delivery is recorded when the goods are not sent to the branch itself but directly to the construction site. In this case, the order is also reported ready, but the goods cannot be put into storage, for example. Another difference is that I cannot create a quality assurance document for a direct delivery. Intermediate storage is used when a commodity ordered from a supplier is to be delivered directly to a packaging company and from there to the customer. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_supply" with the name "Purchasing - processes" regarding quality assurance: Quality assurance documentation Quality assurance must be carried out for a goods receipt if the part is a QA part or if the indicator "Forced QA inspection" has been set in a document of the document history (requisition, purchase order, goods receipt). The buyer can set this flag, for example, if he expects defective goods in advance, or the person recording the goods receipt if the first defects are already visible at the goods receipt. Only when quality assurance has been carried out for incoming goods to be inspected can the incoming goods be further processed (putaway/provision). This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_supply" with the name "Purchasing - processes" regarding return document: Return document A return document can follow a goods receipt, direct delivery or QS document. On the item, the defects that have occurred can then be indicated and how the goods are to be further processed (new delivery, etc.). The return document can also be printed out and then serves as a (return) delivery note. The order goes back to the "open" state by entering a return document, which allows a new goods receipt to be entered. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_supply" with the name "Purchasing - processes" regarding 15. supplier's declaration: Docu supplier declaration. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_supply" with the name "Purchasing - processes" regarding 16. account assignment / initial account assignment: Docu account assignment / preliminary account assignment.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_supply" with the name "Purchasing - processes" regarding 1. introduction: A complete call-off order typically includes It is still possible to enter several order items per order, namely normal order items and/or call-off order items mixed as desired. By definition, normal order items only contain normal delivery schedules. However, as soon as an order item includes an "on call" delivery schedule, we implicitly speak of a release order item, without the system making an explicit distinction at order item level. A call-off order item can also contain several "on call" delivery schedule lines. For each of these "on-call" delivery schedule lines, delivery schedule lines for released quantities can then be entered. However, the system (in the current version) does not link the latter with the corresponding "on-call" delivery schedule line, which is why this affiliation is not visible on the corresponding masks. In addition to the delivery schedule lines for released quantities, normal delivery schedule lines and delivery schedule lines independent of the release order can also be entered. In the current version of the system, however, no distinction is made between the two types of normal delivery schedule lines. Tip: Due to the current system restrictions, it is recommended for the sake of clarity that per release order item to be recorded.

In addition, the total ordered (i.e. already called off) quantity is displayed in the Ordered field (calculated online = total quantity - open call-off quantity). Parts Disposition Account The open call-off quantities of all "on call" delivery schedule lines are assigned to an account in the parts disposition account. The corresponding balance is displayed in the MRP stock line with type = "On call, open" (slot called.quantity). In the MRP stocks line with type = "Ordered" (slot placed.quantity) the balance of all normal delivery schedules, i.e. all delivery schedules for released quantities and all delivery schedules independent of release orders, is shown. Business process order "On call" Delivery schedules only know the status "On call" (PO_CALL). This status is assumed when saving for the first time after the entry.

This is the description of the module "attrcbag" with the name "Conditional material characteristic": A conditional attribute determines the value of the wrapped data field using a conditional table. This conditional table determines the possible values (characteristics) of the attribute. The conditional table is only evaluated at the time of the conditional attribute query. Only then the entries (conditions) of the table are calculated. As with the evaluation of each condition (=formula) in ClassiX®, it may happen that the conditions contain variables that are not automatically found by the system. Therefore, when creating these conditions (table entries), you should make sure that the conditional attribute is later used in a context in which the conditions can be evaluated. Or in the conditional attribute the flag "ignore non-determinable/calculable condition" is set, i.e. such conditions are simply ignored. The conditional table can be tested directly in the input window, the required variables are then interactively queried by the system. (see menu item "Test conditional attribute" or corresponding button) For general information on processing conditional tables, please refer to Tables. With the special menu item (>>Edit>Conditional Tables>Rows>>) "Fill with Attribute Table" you can have exactly one row created for each table entry of the attribute set for the column for a newly created conditional attribute that has only one column and one attribute with a global table set there. Only the results must be edited manually. Conditions can also be taken from another conditional attribute. To do this you have to open the attribute from which you want to copy the conditions, call the copy buffer and move the desired conditions into the copy buffer. In the attribute to be extended the conditions can now be dropped into the table. New table entries are then created with the dropped conditions and an empty result. The result type results from the type of the conditioned attribute and possibly the result type of the first table entry, if it exists. You can find more information in the topic Features. Attention: Attribute values are only supported in the formulas up to a maximum of 100 characters!. This is the description of the functionality of the module "attrcbag" with the name "Conditional material characteristic" regarding Nested conditions: ClassiX® offers the possibility to nest conditions, i.e. to create the condition within the condition. This is not necessary, but it can make the maintenance of attributes clearer and thus more secure, as not all possible combinations have to be maintained in one single table. The following example shows how multi-level tables can be created from a single-level table. Note: Nested tables can only be defined for attributes that do not represent a character string. This is the description of the functionality of the module "attrcbag" with the name "Conditional material characteristic" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain the conditional attribute. This is the description of the functionality of the module "attrcbag" with the name "Conditional material characteristic" regarding List window: Serves to list the attribute objects.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_vocabulary" with the name "Multilingual dictionary" regarding Morpheme: The overview begins with the smallest meaningful unit of a language, the so-called morphemes. A morpheme can also be described as the smallest semantically interpretable element of a word, i.e. a word consists of one or more morphemes.{img type="fileId" fileId="332" thumb="box" width="100%"} Morphemes are phonetically realised as phonetic sound sequences (in units of a sound system (phonetics)), phonologically as phoneme sequences (in units of the speech system (phonology)), in writing as grapheme sequences (in units of a writing system). These sequences of sounds, phonemes or graphemes represent the morpheme in certain environments; the sounds, phonemes and graphemes themselves do not carry any meaning of their own but, as building blocks of the morpheme, only have a meaning-differentiating function. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_vocabulary" with the name "Multilingual dictionary" regarding Words: A word or a combination of words is (only) the linguistic expression of a term or the direct designation of a term via its meaningful morpheme. While the term contains the mental idea of the object or fact it designates (the meaning), the designation is the linguistic sign that refers to the intended object or fact (the name). It consists of a word(one-word denomination), e.g. dog(Simplizium) or dog owner (Kompositum), or a group of words(multi-word denomination), e.g. Faraday cage. On the one hand, meaning is the knowledge of the usual use of a word or expression within a language community and a given context. Meaning is also considered to be what someone understands on the basis of a sign or a linguistic expression. A word can have one meaning (univok) or several (equivok). Univocity is the unambiguousness of the relationship between word (sign) and meaning. If there is no uniqueness, a word is ambiguous (equivok). This equivocality in a broader sense is the ambiguous relationship between sign and signified. In a narrower sense, equivok is only used to refer to words that have the same sound but different meanings. {img type="fileId" fileId="338" thumb="box" width="100%"} Equivocality (ambiguity) in a broader sense occurs as homonymy (like-name), synonymy (like-sense) or analogy. If a linguistic expression (word, sign) with the same name has several meanings (pre-ambiguous relationship), one speaks of a homonym (in the broader sense) or of an equivalent expression (in the narrower sense) (example: "bank" for financial institution or seating furniture). In some cases, a homonymy (eponym) is only used if the origin of the word is different (example: "Tau" for rope coming from the Low German and for damp precipitation from the Old High German tou). This homonymy in the narrower sense is then distinguished from polysemy (ambiguity of a word with identical word origin) (example: "horse" for animal and gymnastic apparatus). Synonyms are different linguistic expressions with the same meaning (examples: "grandpa" = "grandfather"; "white horse" = "grey horse"). The synonymy is a post-unambiguous relationship between sign and designated. In addition to this term of synonymy in the narrower sense, synonymy (then in a broader sense) is also used in the case of words that are only related in meaning. Strict synonymy requires not only that two lexical signs have the same denotative meaning, but also that they are interchangeable in all contexts and have the same effect in all contexts. Examples of strict synonymic pairs in German are, according to general opinion: orange - orange; match - match; couch - sofa; helicopter - helicopter. A homoionym (also called partial synonym) is often confused with the widely used synonym. A homoionym would be, for example, "car" and "motor vehicle", as it is not interchangeable in every context: The opposite of synonymy is antonymy (beautiful/ugly; cold/hot). The analogy is a special case of ambiguity and "exists when the various designated objects are in a certain relationship of dependence on each other or have a certain equality of structures". A homograph or homoglyph is a word from a group of words which all have the same spelling but different meanings and often a different pronunciation. (Reindeer as animal and as person). With the same pronunciation it is also a homophone.). This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_vocabulary" with the name "Multilingual dictionary" regarding Terms: Terms are related to each other in various ways. The generic term of a term is called a hyperonym, the subordinate term a hyponym.(Vegetable is a hyperonym of beans, tomato is a hyponym of vegetable). There are no limits to the number of levels(an animal is a hyponym of a mammal, a dog is a hyponym of an animal, a basset is a hyponym of a dog). {img type="fileId" fileId="334" thumb="box" width="100%"} The thesaurus standards DIN 1463-1 or the international equivalent ISO 2788 provide for the following types of relations and associated abbreviations:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_vocabulary" with the name "Multilingual dictionary" regarding Languages: Language here is the verbal communication of people, consisting of words (of a vocabulary). Ferdinand de Saussure conceived language as a sign system and conceived the language sign as a compelling connection between the sound image (signifiant = the signifying) and the imagination (signifié = the signified), i.e. as something mental. A grammar puts the words in relation to each other. Words of different languages can be brought into a direct connection by their common meaning. The words "tree" and "árbol" are three different words with the same meaning. A written language represents a language using a writing system. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_vocabulary" with the name "Multilingual dictionary" regarding Type systems: The main writing systems fall into the 4 categories: Logograms, syllable writing, alphabets, phonetic transcriptions:.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_vocabulary" with the name "Multilingual dictionary" regarding The object-oriented model in ClassiX®: The abstraction of the above mentioned terms leads to the following modelling: {img type="fileId" fileId="336" thumb="box" width="100%"} One of the characteristics of a language (a language system) is that it defines its graphic and phonetic transcription systems for the (spoken) words. A word is first defined in its relation to a language and its relation to a graphic transcription chosen in that language. The word element contains the graphic representation of the spoken word. A word also has N relations to meanings, which, however, are further specified via property elements. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_vocabulary" with the name "Multilingual dictionary" regarding The grammar rules: By adding additional information to a word - such as part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), numerus (singular, plural, pluraletantum, etc.), case, genus, etc. - the words and all their characteristics are automatically output by means of fixed grammar rules for the individual languages: in the case of nouns, for example, with the specific article, the singular and plural form, as well as the declension.

This is the description of the module "purccomp" with the name "Complaint voucher": It happens that goods are taken from the warehouse for a customer's needs, but only at this point is it determined that the goods are defective. Now, these goods can no longer be assigned to a particular goods receipt, but it must still be possible to return them to the supplier who most probably delivered this part. This is the function of the complaint document. This can be created directly for a stock removal or optionally also for a quality assurance document that has a stock removal as its predecessor. If the goods are expected back from the supplier, this can be activated with the checkbox "Goods are expected back", this complaint behaves like an order. The quantity is displayed in the dispatch account until the complete delivery. It may also be the case that the goods have been ready for some time at the customer and only then the customer discovers that the goods are defective and sends them back. In this case, there is the possibility to search for the original goods withdrawal document on the complaint document using the order number. A link to a goods withdrawal document is always advisable, as this is the only way to ensure that the material flow and cost distribution is 100% correct and remains traceable for later. Since a withdrawal document is not always available, for example in the case of Kanban or manual warehouse parts without warehouse management, it is also possible to attach the complaint document directly to an order header so that the flow of goods can be assigned at least to one order or cost object. The return loop is also fully integrated for this document, i.e. if a goods receipt is not perfect according to this complaint document, it is immediately sent back via a return document. The difference between the return document and the complaint document is The complaint document always refers to a goods removal The return document must refer to a goods receipt as a predecessor. The return document can therefore only be used if the disposition process of the part is not yet completed due to a QA or missing goods putaway or staging. If this process has already been completed, there is still the possibility to send the goods back via the complaint document. Business Process If no quality assurance document has been created for the removal from storage, the quantity made available is deducted from the parts requisition item/order item that may have been placed before the goods are removed. It can now be removed again via the staging list. If the goods receipt now arrives for an item that has already been made available in the meantime by another withdrawal, the status of the goods receipt changes to "goods putaway" and must be put away. If the item has not yet been removed again, the goods receipt goes to the status "Ready". In the case of partial quantities (requirement has already been partially covered), the goods receipt first goes to the status "staging", but after staging its partial quantity it changes to the status "putaway" so that the remaining quantity can be put away. The cost object is then credited by the goods receipt. If the complaint document was not expected back, the crediting of the cost unit can take place via an incoming credit note. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purccomp" with the name "Complaint voucher" regarding Incoming credit notes for complaints: It is possible to request a credit note for a complaint, especially if the goods complained about are not expected to be returned. This credit note is to be recorded differently from credit notes received on the basis of return documents, as these are recorded via the order preceding the return document. No purchase order exists in the document history for complaint documents. Incoming credit notes for complaints are thus to be entered via free items (see docu incoming invoices/incoming invoice items). The complaint can be selected here as the predecessor. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purccomp" with the name "Complaint voucher" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain complaint documents Complaint documents can only be created from stock removals via its toolbar!. This is the description of the functionality of the module "purccomp" with the name "Complaint voucher" regarding List window: This window is used to list complaint documents.
