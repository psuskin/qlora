You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe. If you don't know the answer to a question, please don't share false information.user

In the following, you will be provided with the description of a module. Your task is to generate realistic questions referencing this module description from the perspective of an unfamiliar user who would like to know more about a certain functionality specific to the provided module. Please use both the imperative and interrogative forms and try not to repeat verbs for the questions to maximize variety.
