Module description: This is the description of the module "member" with the name "Member - Dynamic data fields": With this application you can create, persist and then maintain members. One must be aware that only persistent members can and should be changed. Therefore you have to make created, first transient, members persistent at runtime, only then you are allowed to change them. Transient members of the ClassiX® system, i.e. members that are loaded from the *.DIC and *.INI files when the system is started, may neither be changed nor made persistent. Once created and made persistent, members can no longer be deleted. Once created and made transient members cannot be deleted either, but they will no longer be present when the system is next booted. Making members persistent only works from the list window, this is a security measure. For example, if you have created several transient members and you don't want to keep one of them, you can make the members you want to keep persistent, restart the system and then only the persisted members will be available.

Module description: This is the description of the functionality of the module "supplier" with the name "Supplier modules" regarding Input window: This module is used to maintain supplier data. You can select a supplier by entering the supplier number in the Number field and confirm with RETURN. Suppliers (creditors) are identified via the menu item 'Partner'-'Suppliers' or the supplier symbol is called up. To create a new business partner, click on 'New' in the opened list. The Supplier window opens, in which you can now enter the relevant data. To edit an existing business partner, double click on the corresponding entry in the supplier list. The fields in the editing windows are confirmed with the 'Tab' key. At the end all new entries are saved by clicking on 'OK'. However, before creating a new vendor, you should first check whether a company entry for this business partner may already exist in the partner administration. If this is the case, you only need to add the role 'Vendor' to the existing data record. The number range is determined internally and can be easily set up and managed via the counter. However, the number ranges of customers and vendors must not be identical and must not overlap. Fields marked with "italics" represent data directly from the company. If something is changed in one of these fields, the change is applied to all roles and the company itself. All this data can also be maintained directly in the company input window. In the Article tab, all articles are displayed that have once passed through this supplier. Description of the columns in the list: The first column shows the article in the line. This is followed by the order number of this part from the selected supplier. Price: This is the price negotiated in a supply agreement with this supplier, which has become or will become valid from the date below.

Module description: This is the description of the module "costiobj" with the name "Internal cost unit": Cost objects are part of cost accounting alongside cost types and cost centres. However, the term cost object is also used synonymously with the term opportunity (marketing/sales), the term project (order processing) and the term framework contract (purchasing), depending on the field of expertise. A cost object thus describes a business object to which various existing objects and various documents can be assigned. Internal cost units are e.g. own development orders or trade fair appearances. The costs posted via financial accounting can also be posted to cost centres in parallel (similar to "statistical internal orders" in an SAP system). The documents assigned to an internal cost object, i.e. the documents posted with an internal cost object can also contain costs/services. Thus, costs/services can be assigned to an internal cost object either directly via financial accounting or via special (cost) documents (e.g. time sheets).

If you use the text module as a condition, select one of the other two points, depending on whether you want to assign it to purchasing or sales. Once you have done this, you will notice that some checkboxes have been opened and set in the document group to select the documents for which the text module is to be valid. For example, if you have a sales condition that is only valid for quotation and order, you can remove the check marks from the other two checkboxes. If you now want to insert a text module in a delivery note, the text module just created (only set for offer and order) is not available for selection. You should make sure that when converting documents, such as creating an order from an offer, only the text modules that are valid for an order are taken over.

Module description: This is the description of the module "intrastat" with the name "Intrastat declaration": In the context of the compilation of intra-trade statistics by the Federal Statistical Office of the Federal Republic of Germany, enterprises are required to report their trade in goods to and from other EU countries. The AppsWarehouse® module for Intrastat reporting compiles these data from incoming goods, direct deliveries and outgoing delivery notes for specific periods and prepares them for online transmission via the Internet to the Federal Statistical Office. For such Internet registrations, the Federal Statistical Office provides the so-called IDEV reporting system (Internet Data Collection in the Network of the Federal and Länder Statistical Offices) https://www-idev.destatis.de/idev/.Further information on reporting in intra-trade can be found at https://www-idev.destatis.de/idev/doc/intra/hilfe.html.Instructions for completing the IntraStat reports can be found at https://www-idev.destatis.de/idev/doc/intra/doc/Intrahandel_Leitfaden.pdf. This is the description of the functionality of the module "intrastat" with the name "Intrastat declaration" regarding List window: This window is used to create, process and list the period-specific goods movements from delivery notes, goods receipts and direct deliveries. On the left side, a period to be displayed can be selected, on the right side the relevant goods movements from delivery notes, goods receipts and direct deliveries are displayed. If a monthly period is selected in the left part (tree view over the periods) and thus the documents are displayed on the right side of the window, the monthly period can also be deleted again using the right mouse button. The tree is divided per client. Therefore, if there are several clients, the system checks for each document whether a predecessor can be determined. If so, the system checks to which client the cost centre of the predecessor is assigned. The document is posted in the IntraStat of this client found. The individual rows in the list window can be edited using the right mouse button. This is the description of the functionality of the module "intrastat" with the name "Intrastat declaration" regarding Edit window IntraStat message: This window allows you to view and modify the details of the IntraStat message.

Column Description Determination logic Default setting Date Output of the declaration period of the currently selected list Posting date of the header document - This date is also used to assign the IntraStat declaration to the posting period Document Output of type (delivery note or goods receipt) and number of the goods document Traffic direction A "D" stands for dispatched, exported goods (delivery note), an "A" for imported goods (goods receipt) Delivery note = "D" (delivery) Goods receipt = "A" (arrival) A direct delivery document can be either "A" or "D". The rules are as follows: If the supplier outside the home country is located in a country within the EU and this supplier delivers to the home country, this is type "A" -- It is imported from the EU to the home country. If this foreign supplier also delivers to another EU country, this document is not taken into account. If the supplier is a national and delivers to another EU country, the type is "D". The EU is supplied from the home country Example for direct deliveries (source chapter 9.1 of the official filling-in instructions): Situation (intra-Community triangular trade) A German company D sells to a Belgian company goods which D has acquired in France. The goods are shipped directly from France to Belgium. Question: Where should Intrastat declarations be made? Answer: France (dispatch) and Belgium (arrival) require one Intrastat declaration each, whereas Germany does not. In principle, Intrastat declarations are only to be submitted in the EU Member States which are physically affected by the movement of goods as the Member State of dispatch or the Member State of arrival. Country of destination/dispatch Country of destination (or country of dispatch in the case of incoming goods/direct deliveries) to or from which the goods have been moved Delivery note: Country of recipient (delivery address) Goods receipt: Country of the supplier Direct delivery: - For direction of traffic "A" country of the supplier - For direction of traffic "D" country of the consignee See also page 16 box 8a+b of the official instructions for completion . Region of origin / region of destination Region of origin (or region of destination in the case of incoming goods / direct deliveries) of the IntraStat notification Federal state of the client's location Mode of transport Route of transport of the document. Default setting is "Road transport" Transaction type Classification of the goods movement (specified by IntraStat) Default setting always "Final purchase / sale See also page 47 Annex 2 of the Official Filling Instructions . Part Number Number of the part belonging to the part roll If a part is specified on the document, it is entered here. The weight of the delivery is then determined from this part, unless it is explicitly stated there. Goods number Goods number of the part When booking IntraStat messages via the header document, the goods number is left blank by default to avoid errors. An error message "No commodity code" appears When the individual items of documents are loaded, the commodity number is searched for via the part master of the part connected to the document. This is taken over if found, otherwise it also remains empty. Attention: If the commodity code stored on the part is not recorded in the system as a combined nomenclature, the number is not taken from the part and an error message "No commodity code" is displayed. See also page 25, box 13 of the official filling-in instructions . Description Description of the part Weight Weight in its standard unit of measurement (unless a special unit of measurement is required for the specified goods number according to the list of goods) Delivery note: Net weight from colliding data of the delivery note header or sum of all items (part weight * quantity) Goods receipt: Total of all items (part weight * quantity) Direct delivery: sum of all items (part weight * quantity). The weight can only be entered if a valid commodity code has been selected, as the commodity code determines whether the weight must be indicated in a so-called "special unit of measurement". Quantity in supplementary units If it has been determined via the commodity code that this group of goods is not to be reported via its weight but with its quantity (e.g. household coffee machines), the quantity of the delivery in the supplementary unit must be entered here. To be taken from the quantity delivered of the transaction to be declared. See also Chapter 5, page 25, box 17 of the official filling-in instructions . Re. value The invoice amount in €, to be specified for certain types of business Delivery note: Value of the previous order item without freight and packaging costs. If the item itself is not calculated because a superior item has a fixed sum, there may be deviations between the value determined here and the value actually calculated. In these cases a warning message is issued on the IntraStat message. The invoice value is determined from the account assignment of the order item (first 3 elements of the accounted.amount vector = without freight / packaging ). If this vector is not present at the order item (no direct invoice successor item, item below set item or below price group), the order item value per unit is determined and multiplied by the delivery note item quantity. Goods receipt: Value from the order item without surcharges Direct delivery: Value from the order item without surcharges Stat. value This field does not have to be filled in if the goods transaction is a sale (key 11 in the transaction type field) or a commission or consignment transaction (key 12 in the transaction type field) and the total value of the corresponding shipments in the previous or current year did not exceed €42 million. This field is filled with the value of the Re. value field as default Errors/remarks Error messages and other remarks that are automatically written by this machine when the data is created. The remark fields of all lines must be empty for the transmission file to be created Warnings When processing the document immediately after posting via the preprocessing mask for IntraStat, warnings were issued, which appear here. These can be edited via the editing mask ("Warnings" button). This is the description of the functionality of the module "intrastat" with the name "Intrastat declaration" regarding Option window: All settings for the structure and processing of the data can be made here. The window can only be closed with the "OK" button. This is the description of the functionality of the module "intrastat" with the name "Intrastat declaration" regarding EU Final Auditing Window: This window offers the possibility to list all final invoices for a pre-settable period. The total revenue of the final invoices without freight surcharges is displayed and compared to the total value of all Intrastat declarations reported via delivery notes In this way, a plausibility check can be performed on all reported goods movements. [/INST]
1. What is the purpose of the Intrastat declaration module?
The purpose of the Intrastat declaration module is to compile trade data in goods moving between member states of the European Union (EU) and prepare it for online transmission to the Federal Statistical Office.

2. How do you select a period for display in the List window?
To select a period for display in the List window, users can choose a monthly period from the tree view over the periods on the left side of the window and click the right mouse button. This will delete the monthly period and allow users to post the documents to the selected client.

3. Can direct deliveries be either 'D' or 'A'?
Direct deliveries can be either 'D' for dispatched, exported goods or 'A' for imported goods. The rules for determining the type of direct delivery depend on the supplier's location and the destination country.

4. Which country's data is included in the Intrastat message?
The data set in the Intrastat message includes the country of destination (or country of dispatch in the case of incoming goods/direct deliveries), the delivery note country of origin (or country of dispatch), the mode of transport, and the route of transport.

5. Why might an error message "No commodity code" appear?
An error message "No commodity code" might appear when loading individual items of documents if no commodity code has been selected for the part, even though it is stored in the system as a combined nomenclature.

6. How is the weight of a delivery determined?
The weight of a delivery is determined by entering the weight in its standard unit of measurement (unless a special unit of measurement is required for the specified goods number) based on the part weight and quantity.

7. What is the significance of the Re. value field?
The Re. value field indicates the invoice amount in euros for certain types of business transactions. It is determined from the account assignment of the order item (without freight and packaging costs) and is filled with the value of the Re. value field as default.

8. What happens when the Intrastat message contains errors or remarks?
When errors or remarks occur during the creation of the Intrastat message, they are listed in the Errors/Remarks section of the window. These can be edited through the editing mask ("Warnings" button).

Module description: This is the description of the module "pusaitem" with the name "Merchandise": Merchandise parts are parts in an externally built database composed of price lists from different suppliers. Price lists from suppliers can therefore be read into a separate database. In order to be able to access these parts in one's own database, there is the extra mask "Merchandise", which enables access to the external database here in the master data, as well as when inserting positions in offers/orders.A trading good is a part with a purchasing and sales role. It would also be possible to create a part in the part master and then create the respective roles individually. With the help of this application it is possible to process the part master, the purchasing data and (the first) sales role simultaneously in a fast entry. It is still possible to switch to the respective role at any time to make more detailed changes. Parts created here can also be edited in the parts master. This is the description of the functionality of the module "pusaitem" with the name "Merchandise" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain a part object. You can select a part object by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". To create a new part, press New. On the 'Merchandise' card, first enter a number and a multilingual text. In the field 'Purchase data' or 'Sales data' , in the lower part of the screen, you can enter all specific data such as price and quantity. (see also price maintenance) If a trading good has several sales roles, these are displayed in a list. Double-click on an object to open the Edit sales item window. On the 'Supplier' tab, you can now select suppliers who supply the part via 'Insert'. The search mask of the supplier master opens, from which you can select or create the corresponding supplier with a double click. The price window (supplier agreements) opens immediately afterwards. Once a supplier agreement has been entered, it is displayed in the Supplier tab. Description of the columns in the list In the first column, the number of the supplier is displayed. This is followed in the third column by the supplier name and the order number belonging to the order item. Price: This is the price negotiated in a supply agreement with this supplier, which has become or will become valid as of the date below. Only in the case of real supply agreements is this price shown in green; in the case of movements that have passed through a supplier with whom no supply agreement has been made, this price is grey. The price is also grey if the supplier does not have its own price on its supplier agreement (price type: no value). In this case, the currently valid price is taken from the order item master record. Last price: The last price of the order item with date at this supplier is indicated here. Display mode The display mode at the bottom of the window is a filter for whether only supplier agreements or all transaction data are to be displayed in the list. Movement data is saved for each supplier who has supplied this part once. more on the subject of supplier agreements Movements in the list are displayed completely in grey/black and are thus immediately distinguishable from supplier agreements! You insert the buyers for the trading goods on the 'Customers' card. Click on 'Insert' to open the search mask of the customer master, from which you can select or create the corresponding customer with a double click. A small window then opens in which you can enter the sales agreement for the customer. In order to be able to vary the price calculation, e.g. if there are sales items on which no discount is to be granted or the sales item cannot be packaged, you can switch off the calculation by removing a tick in front of the respective items. Description of the columns in the list First the customer number and the name are output. This is followed by the number, which is either the same as that of the part or you can determine yourself for each customer. Finally, the agreed price is displayed.

Module description: This is the description of the module "cxDocument" with the name "Document": A document is used to output receipts. It consists of document modules and has other characteristics such as margin settings, document type, name and document number. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxDocument" with the name "Document" regarding Label printing: A distinction is made between two options for label printing: The first option is to print a single label on a continuous printer. In the 'Edit' menu, the document type can be changed to label. The style sheet and the list of blocks are not available in this input window. An OLE object is provided for this purpose, in which the content of the label can be specified (the Word document should be the size of the label). In the application area, a label type can be selected via Type. The second option is to print a label sheet (A4). A label type can be selected via Type in the application area. The label grid must be specified in the module list box (module: label grid) and then modules with the contents can be inserted. When selecting a label raster module, the number of separating columns in a line must be taken into account. This is created manually in the 'configuration.counter' attribute of the document. In example 2 and 3 there are additional cells between the individual cells as separating columns. In order to be able to skip these, it must be known in advance how many are present in a row. If this is not done or is incorrectly specified, the content of the label is written into the separating columns. Example 1: Line without separating columns: configuration.counter = 0 Example 2: Line with one separating column: configuration.counter = 1 Example 3: Line with two separator columns: configuration.counter = 2 The entire contents of the label are placed in one cell at a time. The labels currently available are the address labels and the storage location labels. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxDocument" with the name "Document" regarding email: This document type is used to define documents sent by e-mail.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxDocument" with the name "Document" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select a document object. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxDocument" with the name "Document" regarding Document - data exchange: A separate window is available for the data exchange of documents to provide the necessary information. This information includes the following details: - Where is the file that controls the loading of the document or where should it be stored. - Where is the file that controls the loading of the modules or where should it be stored. - In which directory are the Word documents located or from which directory should they be loaded. The groups "Export" and "Import" are shown and hidden depending on the direction of the data exchange (determined by the radio buttons). Only those documents are exported which are also displayed in the list. When importing, you can define in the group how the import of the blocks should be proceeded. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxDocument" with the name "Document" regarding Import: Technical description / import of documents {img type="fileId" fileId="279" thumb="box" width="100%"}.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxDocument" with the name "Document" regarding Data Acquisition Wizard: This wizard allows you to set settings for a group of selected documents in one. The selection of documents can still be changed while the wizard is open. The checkboxes in front of the respective groups can be used to show or hide the data fields. Data fields that are shown are changed in the documents by the wizard. These groups are not changed by hiding them. This is the description of the functionality of the module "cxDocument" with the name "Document" regarding Import of documents: For the import of documents with document modules are required: Document module description file (contains document module header data such as number, name etc. and the list of submodules; default name component.dat), document description file (contains document header data such as number, name etc. and the list of document modules; default name document.dat) and corresponding pairs (for simple contents) or pair groups (for conditional documents) of the MS-Word files (e.g. 10_1.doc / 10_2.doc for the simple module 10 in two languages or 11_0_1.doc / 11_1_1.doc / 11_0_2.doc / 11_1_2.doc for the conditional module 11 with two conditions in two languages each) Before loading, a query window is used to select what to do with any existing blocks (overwrite, use, cancel). If a document to be imported has the number of an already existing one, the import process is aborted. See also LOAD_DOCUMENT. [/INST]

Module description: This is the description of the module "jobssing" with the name "Sequence of operations": A work plan consists of individual work sequences or operations. This module is used to record individual work sequences, i.e. work sequences that are only to be carried out at the workstation/resource specified in this work sequence. Only the set-up time and the piece time can be entered as a formula - and therefore variable. If a sequence of operations is to be defined variably with regard to the workstation/resource, a conditional sequence of operations can be inserted into the work plan. This is the description of the functionality of the module "jobssing" with the name "Sequence of operations" regarding Distribution or calculation of production costs: In principle, the production costs for a part are divided into two differently valued parts: Labour costs and material costs As a standard, the additional costs incurred in addition to wages and materials, e.g. for purchasing or stock management of the required parts, are included in the overheads. These are stored globally in the client. However, the following approach is preferable in order to be able to calculate production costs precisely according to other costs incurred during production, such as machine running costs and programming costs, without having to include all costs invisibly in overheads: In the part or at the work plan position, a material characteristic must be defined which contains the costs for e.g. the machine costs per hour according to the following format costs = 120€/h (see below in the picture in the work sequence) You must therefore create a material characteristic for each cost element. The characteristic can also be stored directly on variant parts and calculate itself from other constraints (calculated or conditional characteristics). To be able to take these costs into account, a formula in the resource of the work sequence is necessary (in the picture the standard costs of the working group): Standard costs = formula = costs+(40€/1h) Since the formulae do not know any compound units, instead of 40€/h --> write 40€/1h and put this in brackets. The machine costs per hour specified via the material characteristic are now added to the standard machine costs per hour. In order to check whether the costs are actually there without any error occurring, the formula can be extended by a query as follows In this case, the system queries in advance whether the costs have been found and otherwise uses the value 0?, whose unit is based on the next component for further calculation. In the parts precalculation we then immediately see the result: The marked line is our work sequence, which has received wage costs of 1.600€ for 600 minutes (10 hours) (120€ machine running costs + 40€ standard costs = 160€ per hour * 10 hours = 1600€). This is the description of the functionality of the module "jobssing" with the name "Sequence of operations" regarding Set-up time / piece time / throughput time: The times can be given as a value, formula or conditional table in the parts list. Examples of values that can be used in a formula or condition in the sequence of operations:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "jobssing" with the name "Sequence of operations" regarding Functionality: This window is used to maintain individual work sequences or operations. You can select a sequence directly by entering the desired sequence number in the sequence field and confirming with RETURN. To show that this sequence of operations is an external production you have to select a supplier under resources. In addition, a unit of performance that represents this external performance and must be defined at the supplier. In this case of external production there are several rules to be observed, so that e.g. the deregistration of the PDC hours but also the preliminary costing of parts runs smoothly: A further description of external production within the work plans can be found here. The second tab "Document directory references" allows you to link the position to document directories. A document could thus serve as a quality assurance instruction, for example. [/INST]

Module description: This is the description of the module "costsobj" with the name "Cost unit (project)": Along with cost types and cost centres, cost objects are part of cost accounting. However, the term cost object is also used synonymously with the term sales opportunity (marketing/sales), the term framework agreement (purchasing) and the term internal cost object (e.g. R&D), depending on the specialist area. A cost object thus describes a business object to which a wide variety of inventory objects and a wide variety of documents can be assigned.The documents assigned to a cost object, i.e. the documents posted with a cost object can also contain costs/services. Thus, costs/services can be assigned to a cost object either directly via financial accounting or via special (cost) documents (e.g. time sheets).A (specialised) sales cost unit can be assigned inventory data of a plant (industrial plant, machine, part (e.g. for development projects)) and/or a business partner(customer, interested party, operator) or an operative partner(interested party, operator).Transaction data such as offers or orders can also be assigned to a sales cost unit. In this case, a "project" is thus the superordinate node for various offer or order documents. Usually at the beginning of a quotation or order processing there is the definition of a project, with specification of the external and internal project manager, the assignment to a plant and possibly also the determination of a first rough cost framework(order/sales planning) and a time schedule(network), which can be imported directly from a planning by means of MS-Projects and can also be reconciled with it.Using certain buttons in the toolbar, quotations and orders can therefore be created directly from a sales cost unit. This is the description of the functionality of the module "costsobj" with the name "Cost unit (project)" regarding Framework contracts and call orders: Blanket orders can also be defined above a sales cost object. The sales cost object takes over the definition of the outline agreement, for example, the partner and the contract period are defined. The "Framework contract data" tab is used to define the items, the total quantity agreed in each case and the price negotiated (project price). For this purpose the module of customer agreements is used. The call-off orders are recorded as normal sales orders, which are assigned to the outline agreement as cost objects. The creation of a call-off order is initiated via the sales cost object. For this purpose, the articles which are called off by the customer are selected in the list. Then the sales order with the order items is created via the context menu "Create call order". The respective quantity called off and the delivery date must be entered in the order item. In the customer agreement, the order items called up are listed in the "Receipts" tab. In addition, the quantity called off is displayed in the tab "Framework agreement". This is the description of the functionality of the module "costsobj" with the name "Cost unit (project)" regarding Input window: This window is used for maintaining sales cost objects. You can select a sales cost object by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item "Search". The editing mask consists of the tab for entering the project data, the tab for displaying additional data for the project, the tab for displaying the documents assigned to the project, the tab for editing the framework agreement data and the tab for editing the documents and/or other associations assigned to a project. This is the description of the functionality of the module "costsobj" with the name "Cost unit (project)" regarding Change sales cost unit settings with Wizzard: With this wizard, settings can be set for a group of selected sales cost objects in one. The selection of the sales cost objects can still be changed while the wizard is open. The checkboxes in front of the groups "Category", "Status", "Business field" and "Type" can be used to show or hide the data fields. Data fields that are shown are changed in the sales cost units by the Wizzard. These groups are not changed by hiding them. This is the description of the functionality of the module "costsobj" with the name "Cost unit (project)" regarding List window: Serves to search and list cost units. This is the description of the functionality of the module "costsobj" with the name "Cost unit (project)" regarding Status: The status of the insurance provider defines the different statuses that an insurance provider can have. The status is defined via the evaluation group "COST_OBJECTIVE_STATE". This evaluation group can contain both simple structure nodes and structure statuses . In the case of structure status, the status is automatically determined by transition conditions in further structure statuses. All simple structure nodes are displayed for selection and the structure statuses are displayed at the beginning of the status chain. Thus, for example, the structure term "COST_OBJECTIVE_STATE" could be structured as follows: - Completed - Releases In this example, the statuses FINISHED and RELEASED can be set in the cost object by the user. FINISHED blocks the complete processing of the cost unit. No additional data can be added to the cost unit. Existing data cannot be edited. RELEASED releases the processing of the cost unit. Additional data can be added to the cost unit. Existing data can be edited. {img fileId="532" thumb="box" width="100%"} Options for the processing and use of the parts can be stored at the individual statuses. These options are stored as attributes at the structure node (see also Attributes/characteristics and in particular the paragraph: Attributes with control function). This is the description of the functionality of the module "costsobj" with the name "Cost unit (project)" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select an insurance provider. This is the description of the functionality of the module "costsobj" with the name "Cost unit (project)" regarding Option window: Here you can make settings for the behaviour of the module. [/INST]

Module description: This is the description of the module "processes_variant02" with the name "Variant routings and parts lists": A variant bill of material and a variant routing are characterised by the fact that they consist of conditional items, which are defined by formulas depending on attributes. Only when a bill of material is exploded are these other items exploded to "real" bill of material items and the master bill of material becomes a production bill of material. Thus only the master data can contain upperen. The attributes that are significantly involved in the specification are mainly taken from the preceding document of the order item as well as the other higher order items. In this way, similarly constructed parts can use one and the same bill of material although they are not identically constructed. Example {img type="fileId" fileId="330" thumb="box" width="100%"}In this example, variant control is carried out using the attributes DICKE and SORTE_METALL.Without the variant parts list, you would have to create at least two parts lists, as the raw sheet metal differs depending on the type of installation. (And two parts of course, if there were no variant parts). However, ClassiX® uses the upper option, as the example shows. In this case there are two variants, which are dependent on the attribute THICK. Depending on the attribute, the part is then used for 3.0mm or 5.0mm. The main advantage here is the maintenance of the parts lists. Since similar parts lists are combined, the processing effort is minimised, although the creation may be more complex/difficult. [/INST]
Great! Here are some potential questions you could ask about the "processes_variant02" module based on its description:

1. How do the conditional items in the variant bill of material differ from the regular bill of material? Can you provide examples of how these conditions are set up in the module?
2. What role do attributes play in defining the items in the variant bill of material? Are there any specific attributes mentioned in the description that are particularly important for variant control?
3. How does the module handle the exploration of conditional items? Is it done automatically during the Bill of Material creation process, or does it require manual intervention?
4. Can you explain the concept of "upper en" in the context of the module? How does it relate to the master bill of material becoming a production bill of material?

In the following, you will be provided with the description of a module. Your task is to generate questions referencing this module description from the perspective of an unfamiliar user who would like to know more about a certain functionality. Please generate as many questions as you deem reasonable based on the scope of the module description.

Here are the requirements:
- The question should query some relevant aspect of the module's functionality which is described in the module description.
- Please use both the imperative and interrogative forms and try not to repeat verbs for the questions to maximize variety.
- If the information you plan to query seems module-specific, please reference the module name in the query.

Module description: This is the description of the module "origpart" with the name "List of originating products": With this module, proofs of origin can be created for individual items of customer or warehouse orders. This is a list of all those purchased parts for which the respective suppliers cannot explicitly provide proof of valid certificates of origin (origin EU) at the time of delivery (the value of the non-originating goods in a delivery item determines the amount of import duties for some countries). Such declarations can be made by companies acting as "approved exporters" by the customs authorities. Alternatively, a list of the purchased parts clearly declared as originating, as well as a list of all purchased parts - regardless of their originating status - can be issued. The following information on the origin of a product can be entered(if an identifier is no longer valid from the date - as it is older than one year - the system will place a "?" in front of the identifier for further verification. e.g. "?N"): Description Identification Original product U not originating N Reference to invoice R not specified - Requested A With regard to the country of origin, the following information can be entered(if an identifier is no longer valid from the date - as it is older than one year - the system will place a "?" in front of the identifier for further verification. e.g. "?DE"): Description Identification Country code of the country of origin DE (Germany), CH (Switzerland), not specified - Various countries are eligible #. This is the description of the functionality of the module "origpart" with the name "List of originating products" regarding Functionality: Processing starts by dragging and dropping the order items (or groups) for which such a proof of origin is to be created into the list window. There are two buttons (see below) to select either sales or stock order items. The items selected in this way are identified - depending on their processing in the logistical business process - as purchased or manufactured parts, and in the process as either taken from stock or directly scheduled. Thus, not only the master information of a part is assumed: A part, which may be a production part by default, could also - e.g. due to capacity bottlenecks - have been directly procured from a supplier for the order in question, i.e. an order was triggered for this part in this order item. In this case, the part is therefore to be regarded as a purchased part and no longer as a production part. It can therefore happen that a stock-keeping production part has been removed from the warehouse for an order. In order to be able to trace the origin, however, the parts list of this production part must be exploded during the evaluation to see which parts with which origin this production part consists of. Note: Please note that when evaluating the proof of origin before the start, the system-wide validity date is set either to the reference date set manually via the options, or to the creation date of the earliest invoice of the order. If an invoice has not yet been created for the order, the order creation date is used. If the evaluation is aborted, the system date will NOT be reset to the current date, please make sure to reset the system date to the current date. This is done via the main menu "System-->Change date-->Session date", there the field "Validity date". If it is determined for a purchased part on an order position that there is neither an order nor a stock withdrawal for this, an error message is issued. Similarly, an error message is issued for a production part if there is neither a stock withdrawal nor a production-specific parts list. The further processing and evaluation of the parts is shown in the following table: A. Rules for determining the supplier, price and proof of origin for purchased parts held in stock: B. Rules for determining the supplier, price and proof of origin for purchased parts not kept in stock:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "origpart" with the name "List of originating products" regarding List window: List After selecting the items to be processed, the list is built up. In the following section you will find some explanations of the structure/columns of the list. The listing of each position starts with a blue-green (cyan) line, in which In the following lines - depending on the setting of the filters - all parts necessary to deliver the item (parts list information) are output. Some more detailed explanations of these columns follow: Column "Order price It is always rounded to 2 decimal places if the order price is greater than 0.01. It is always rounded to 4 decimal places if the order price is less than 0.01, provided that this does not make it zero. Procurement" column At the end of the list, the totals for the two (according to the 10% and 40% rule) value shares of non-originating goods, their share of the sales value and the total sum of the value of non-originating goods - with their share of the sales value - are again displayed. The sum line "Control value of originating goods" shows the value of the parts that were recognised by the system as originating goods. This is the description of the functionality of the module "origpart" with the name "List of originating products" regarding Option window: All settings can be made here. The window can only be closed with the "OK" button. Each time the main window is opened, the options described here are reset to the default settings. This is the description of the functionality of the module "origpart" with the name "List of originating products" regarding List of originating products: Either a transaction or an order item is transferred to the message ORIGIN_PARTS_LIST. Every found position is evaluated by a "case" branch. Already determined values which are stored in slots of the displayed container (tmpContainer): Product group: Copy(tradeNumber) Part: Get(itemPointer) Quantity: Get(quantity) Procurement price: Get(value) Value: Copy(total.value) Disposition: Copy(dispositionEnum) (Standard) Logistics: Copy(itemPointer.StructureByID(FONT COLOR="#800000">"LOGISTICS").uniqueID) (Standard) provision: Copy(itemPointer.supplyEnum) Main supplier: Copy(supplied.businessObjectPointer).

Module description: This is the description of the module "olapCustomerList" with the name "Customers sales article statistics": With this module a customer/ sales item or a sales item/customer statistic can be created for certain periods of time. The basis of these statistics are 2-dimensional OLAP data cubes (see also monitors) between customers and sales item objects. Depending on the selection of the - primary - dimension (i.e. the point of entry) into the statistics, the second remaining dimension is the so-called secondary dimension. If you choose"customers" as the primary dimension, the "sales items" are the secondary sub-dimension and vice versa.Depending on the selection of the primary dimension (customer or sales item), the total values of the statistics can vary. This is because sales can be made with "customers" even without sales articles (e.g. when using text articles or fixed values in orders or outgoing invoices). A statistic according to "Customers" can therefore be larger in total than the "same" statistic according to "Sales articles".The data is updated every time a quotation, an order or an invoice is saved. Whether the values are shown in the totals of the statistics depends on the status of the respective documents. Below is a list of the statuses that are included in the statistics totals for the various documents (the documents themselves are nevertheless always kept in the corresponding data cubes, only the values are not always added up):Status offersOffer submitted (OFFER_SUBMITTED)Offer partially converted into order (OFFER_CONFIRMED_IN_PART)Offer completely taken over as order (OFFER_CONFIRMED)Orders in statusOrder confirmed (SALES_ORDER_CONFIRMED)Job stopped (SALES_ORDER_STOPPED)Job waiting for acceptance (SALES_ORDER_WAITING_FOR_ACCEPTION)Mission accomplished (SALES_ORDER_IMPLEMENTED)Invoices/credit notesAll registered invoices/credit notes are included in the statistics (registered credit notes are only considered if they are issued for a customer. Credit notes for commission recipients are therefore excluded, for example). Values for packaging and freight are distributed proportionally among the sales items (if available in the invoice or credit memo), therefore there may be differences in the distributions (value of goods - packaging - freight) between the values displayed in these statistics and the values displayed in the list of invoices or credit memos. The totals are of course identical.All statistic values are held in local currency only. This is the description of the functionality of the module "olapCustomerList" with the name "Customers sales article statistics" regarding List window: In this window, after selecting the criteria, the customer/sales item statistics are displayed. [/INST]
Great! Based on the given module description, here are some potential questions an unfamiliar user might ask:

1. How do I create a new statistic for customers/sales items?
2. What are the different dimensions I can select for my statistic, and how do they affect the results?
3. Can I filter my statistic by specific dates or time periods?
4. How do I view the detailed breakdown of each statistic, including the value of goods, packaging, and freight?
5. Are there any default filters or selections available in the list window to narrow down my search?
6. Can I export my statistic data to a CSV file or other format for further analysis?
7. How often is the data in my statistic updated, and what factors influence the update frequency?
8. Can I combine multiple statistics together to view a comprehensive picture of my business performance?
9. Is it possible to drill down deeper into a particular statistic to see the underlying details, such as individual sales items or customers?
10. How do I handle missing or incomplete data within my statistic, and what options are available for dealing with such issues?
11. Can I set up alerts or notifications to inform me whenever significant changes occur within my statistic?
12. Are there any built-in visualization tools available to help me better understand and interpret my statistic data?
13. How do I validate or verify the accuracy of my statistic data, especially during busy periods or when manual errors may occur?
14. Can I perform advanced calculations or analyses on my statistic data, such as calculating growth rates or correlations?
15. How do I ensure that my statistic data remains secure and protected against unauthorized access or tampering?

Module description: This is the description of the module "pricecal" with the name "Calculation scheme": Especially in trading companies, a lot of work is done with supplier price lists. In order not to have to import all parts that a supplier has in his regularly sent price list into the database, there is the external trading goods database.Conditions "net" (are taken over in orders) In addition to the price list, calculation schemes for determining the supplier's own purchase price from the sales price stated in the price list are agreed with the supplier. For example, the price list may contain a sales price of x, and a sales price of 25% has been agreed for the determination of the purchase price. This -25% is therefore part of the calculation schema and is marked as "net" when the condition is created.Conditions "list price related" (are not taken over in orders) If customs duties are added, which have to be taken into account for the determination of the cost price in the order, but which may not be transferred to the order, these surcharges can be marked as "list price related" and can also be recorded in this calculation scheme.List price-related conditions are transferred to the order created from an order.

Module description: This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocret" with the name "Returns and complaints" regarding Return receipt: Based on the supplier's delivery note, the goods receipt is booked. Parts can be defined as QA parts in the master data. Quality assurance must always be carried out for these parts. If the checkbox "mandatory QA inspection" is selected when entering the goods receipt, a quality assurance must also be carried out. Incoming goods items in quality assurance have the status "goods to be inspected". These goods receipt items can only be made available or put into storage when the quality assurance has been completed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocret" with the name "Returns and complaints" regarding 2.2 Quality assurance for incoming goods: In the quality assurance document, goods receipt items can be inserted via the "Insert" button. During selection, the goods receipt items with the status "Goods to be inspected" are displayed immediately. With the "OK" button you can select one or more items for the QA document. Double-click to open the position window. The results of the test can be entered in various input fields for the positions. In addition, documents (e.g. test protocols) can be attached. In the field "In test" the quantity of parts that are currently in test and at the end of the test the quantity of parts that had a positive test result is entered there. The goods receipt items of the inspected and posted QA documents change their status to "provision" or "putaway. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocret" with the name "Returns and complaints" regarding 2.3 Creating a returns document: The document can be created directly from the goods receipt or quality assurance document. You can select items there and create a document with the button to create a return document. The returns document can only be executed for quantities not staged or put away in a goods receipt posting. Goods that have already been put into storage must be used for the supplier complaint document. A return document is created for the marked GR items: In the item tab, double-click on the item to open on the position the position window: Here you can still feel it: This information will be printed on the returns document. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocret" with the name "Returns and complaints" regarding 2.4 Extending the returns document: As long as a returns document is open, it can be extended by entering the following information on the goods receipt document button is pressed. You will then be asked if you want to add the items to the document. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocret" with the name "Returns and complaints" regarding 2.5 Booking the return voucher: By posting the return document, the quantity in the order is offset as not delivered. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocret" with the name "Returns and complaints" regarding 2.6 Goods are returned: A new goods receipt is posted for the original order (!) The document history now looks as follows if the QA document was also posted:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocret" with the name "Returns and complaints" regarding 3 suppliers complaint document: The supplier complaint document is intended for goods that are still in the warehouse or have already been booked out of the warehouse. When goods are stored, they must be posted from the warehouse via cost centre requirements. A quality assurance document can be inserted between the removal from storage and the complaint document for better documentation. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocret" with the name "Returns and complaints" regarding 3.1 Outsourcing: The basis for the complaint document is always an outsourcing. Parts that are still in the warehouse must be booked out via cost centre requirements. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_bprocret" with the name "Returns and complaints" regarding 3.2 Optional: Quality assurance document: This option can or should be selected for better documentation. In this way, it is possible to understand later why these parts were rejected. With the QA document alone, it is also possible to mark parts as defective, i.e. a complaint document does not necessarily have to be created. The requirement for the order or part request item is increased again by the quantity of defective parts. [/INST]

Module description: This is the description of the module "objctsql" with the name "English:Object Query": Based on SQL (Standard Query Language), this module can be used to query data from the object-oriented database of ClassiX®. A common use of SQL is to output certain data fields (using the SELECT statement) from a table (specified with FROM) as a result list under certain conditions (specified with WHERE). Similarly, a list of objects can be selected in this module from which data can be output (FROM "REP collection"). The objects of such a list belong to a certain class or a class inherited from this class. Therefore you have to consider which ("SELECT") data fields you select, furthermore you can query any free data fields (slots) from the objects. Due to the use of an object-oriented database, the selected data fields - nested within themselves - can be references (POINTER or REL_1M) to other objects. This module supports the construction of such data access paths by simple navigation to the referenced classes, such as reference_to_object_1.reference_to_object_2.reference_to_object_3.target_data_field_in_object_3 (the individual references are connected with "." each other). Since such access paths can also contain function or method calls, the classes also output their methods. Once you have selected your ("SELECT") data fields, you can further specify the selection of data to be displayed by a ("WHERE") specification, which must be specified here in the form of a query expression or InstantView® script. The result of the script must always return either TRUE/an Object/1 or FALSE/INVALID/0. After entering all criteria, the result list is displayed in a separate window as an object list. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objctsql" with the name "English:Object Query" regarding Selection window: In this window, the "SELECT", "FROM" and "WHERE" data analogue to SQL are entered. This is the description of the functionality of the module "objctsql" with the name "English:Object Query" regarding Object list: This window is used to list the objects selected by the query. The data fields defined by "SELECT" are output as columns of the list. Double-clicking on an entry in the list opens the edit mask of the currently selected object. [/INST]
Great! Here are some potential questions you could ask to learn more about the functionality of the "objctsql" module:

1. How do I select specific data fields from a table using the "SELECT" statement in objctsql?
2. What is the difference between using "FROM" and "FROM REP collection" in the "SELECT" statement in objctsql?
3. Can I select multiple objects at once using the "FROM" clause in objctsql? If so, how do I do it?
4. How do I filter data using the "WHERE" clause in objctsql? Are there any limitations to what I can filter by?
5. Can I use functions or methods in my "WHERE" clause in objctsql? If so, how do I reference them?
6. How do I navigate to related objects in my query results using objctsql? For example, if I select an object and want to view its parent object or child objects?
7. Is there a way to preview the results of my query before running it in objctsql?
8. Can I save frequently used queries in objctsql for quick reuse later? If so, how do I go about doing this?
9. How do I handle large datasets in objctsql? Are there any performance optimizations I can use to improve query speed?
10. Can I use subqueries or correlated subqueries in objctsql? If so, how do I construct these types of queries?

Module description: This is the description of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file": Evaluation: Performance What should be taken into account when evaluating the logfiles, or what are indications of code that can be optimised? Evaluation: System crashes Blockade trigger - tree view This module is used to create various evaluations of log files and display them accordingly. The files are read out according to sessions (start of ClassiX® until end or crash). The remaining entries of the log file are thus assigned to the created sessions. If additional dbProf files are read in, these entries are assigned to the sessions by the OS Client ID, if possible. An option can be used to set whether or not the previous sessions should be reset before each import. If this option is not set, many days in a row can easily be read in. Either several selected files, entire folders can be read in (subfolders are automatically taken into account) or a time period can be specified in which all log files are automatically searched and loaded. Specifying a time period is best suited in MorphIT, because the MorphIT user does not have to worry about the location of the log files and whether they are on the same computer, especially since in this case no files have to be uploaded. The automatic reading of log files depending on the time period requires that the log files are stored in a temporal subfolder structure, i.e. the following option must be activated in logging.ini. log4cplus.OrganizeLogsByDate=true Selecting individual files also allows you to view files for sessions from different time periods and points side by side. In addition to the sessions and user logins, certain events such as deadlocks, timeouts, crashes, etc. are additionally summarised in monitors across sessions. After reading in, all sessions are displayed in the session list with the most important data. A session is opened by double-clicking on it and you can see what happened. In the Statistics tab, graphical evaluations can be created flexibly. The monitors can be assigned to the diagrams as desired. There is a maximum of 3 diagrams, whereby only one monitor can be assigned to a diagram. You can drag and drop the monitors into the diagram areas or select a monitor and then click on the corresponding "Add monitor" button. For dbProf statistics, the desired evaluation can be selected after a double click. In the X-axis option area, the evaluation variant can be selected, whereby the transactions are evaluated according to time or date. In the case of an evaluation based on time, all transactions are summarised according to their time, so that one can see, for example, which events have occurred at which time of day. In this case, it makes sense to load or select only sessions from a single day. The time span and the period length of the evaluation can be specified in the Options section. The period length self-explanatory determines the accuracy of the statistics. For statistics accurate to the minute, a period length of 1 minute should be selected, but this could lead to extensive graphs. If, on the other hand, you want to make a summary evaluation over several days, you should select the option by date. All transactions of a particular monitor are summarised in days and displayed graphically. You could also select the time of day under Options, outside which the transactions are not considered. The monitor user has the special feature that besides the normal evaluation of the login, the maximum number of simultaneous use of ClassiX on one day is graphically displayed. Either "All sessions" or "Selected sessions only" can be set as an option. With the option "All sessions" all loaded sessions are used for the evaluation, otherwise only the sessions selected in the session list are used. The option "All sessions" can be used to read and compare only dbProf files of different days. So it is not necessary to read in all files from each day. For any number of monitors the transactions can be viewed within a time span. This makes it easier to understand which events are interdependent within a limited period of time. In the tab Blocks/ Crashes/Locks the transactions mentioned above for the selected sessions are displayed. The locking conflicts can be viewed in a summary by "Locked By" (Who is locking the others?) and segment. Red lines in a list or also called ListView Fatals (crashes within a ListView) are displayed in the same tab. RO and RW long distance transactions are grouped by location and displayed in the Long distance TXNs tab. The average duration and the average number of pages read are also displayed. IV faults are displayed in a separate tab. This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding Evaluation: Performance: The following options are available for evaluating performance and determining the causes of good/bad performance:.

Review cross-country skiers TXN: If long-runners that have been marked as blockage triggers (second column) appear in the list with more than two minutes: 5. Statistics: If more than 600 blockades occurred:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding Evaluation: System crashes: For the evaluation of the system crashes the log files of the clients must be loaded, those of the server (cxdbprof.log) can be ignored. By double clicking on the monitor "Crashes" in the list of monitors all crashes are displayed. In the list each crash is described by three columns. (Error message of the crash, if a deadlock has occurred before, output of the C++ stack) In order to record a tendency of the number of crashes or to determine the increase/decrease of errors due to a difference, it is important to record key figures. This output of the key figures is done by clicking the corresponding button. By transferring the key figures daily to Excel, it is possible to make statements about the course of events. The following key figures are available:. This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding List window: To carry out an evaluation, any number of log files must first be selected. The log files are first evaluated according to sessions. A session is the duration from the start of ClassiX® until the termination or system crash. If another ClassiX® instance is started during a session, a counter is incremented in the current session. If the option "Reset sessions each time log files are read in" is not set, log files can be read in one after the other without losing the previously read in sessions. If a file ends before a session is finished, the session end time is set to the time of the last event. If a log file does not start when ClassiX® starts, a session is created that takes the start time of the first event of the file. If errors occur during reading in, these can be viewed later in the window Errors during reading in. Columns of the session list: Double-click on a session to open the session window. The evaluations for the lists, blockades/crashes/locks, ListView Fatals, long distance TXNs and IV errors are always immediately created and displayed for the currently selected sessions.

This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding Evaluation: In this window the diagrams of the evaluation are displayed. This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding Blockade trigger - tree view: If users create time-consuming bookings, it can happen that other users are hindered in their activities, as individual data is exclusively blocked by the booking. The other users then wait for the end of the transaction before they can continue. They only notice this circumstance by an extended duration of the action they are about to perform. Such behaviour is called blocking. As long as the user is waiting for the release of his data, it is possible that he has already locked data for himself, for which other users must then wait. Similar to the snowball system, a network of blockades could develop in an unfavourable case, which is all triggered by the time-consuming booking of the first user. To be able to find such time-consuming bookings that block many users, this tree view is available. Here you can see who the first blocker was, who he blocked, and who was blocked by the other users. Users who have only been blocked without triggering the blockade themselves are not displayed at the top level of the tree. The behaviour of the snowball system must be prevented by targeted improvements to the source code - this tree view should help to locate the critical parts of the programme. This is the description of the functionality of the module "logfistx" with the name "Evaluation log file" regarding System crashes: If the log level "FATAL" appears in a log file, this indicates that the machine has crashed. The next message with log level "ERROR" is the crash message that appears on the screen. The current session is closed and for this current transaction (crash message) the data field "settings" is displayed. The only exception is a "FATAL" from the logger "cx.listview". With this one, the system does not crash because the ListView catches it. If the system crashes without an error message, the last transaction (LogLevel "FATAL") is regarded as the end of the session and displayed in the list of crashes. (StopAllSessionsOfLogFile) investigation: + cx.app INFO "Signal caught: SIGABRT" + cx.app ERROR + cx.main FATAL + FATAL session end. [/INST]
1. When evaluating the log files, consider the following aspects:
* Analyze blockages: Examine the blockade network to identify potential issues.

In the following, you will be provided with the description of a module. Your task is to generate questions referencing this module description from the perspective of an unfamiliar user who would like to know more about a certain functionality. Please generate as many questions as you deem reasonable based on the scope of the module description.

Here are the requirements:
- The question should query some relevant aspect of the module's functionality which is described in the module description.

Module description: This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_salespricing" with the name "Sales pricing" regarding General: ClassiX® offers a high degree of variability in sales pricing. Thus, prices can not only be stored on the article, but also defined individually for customers (customer agreements) or customer groups. In addition, there are extensive possibilities to define discounts/surcharges and over/under prices. The variability is rounded off by the fact that all prices and conditions can be defined using conditional tables and formulas. When creating a price or for example a discount, please use the following diagram to find the right solution in ClassiX. For example, to define a special price of a sales item for a defined customer group you will be guided directly to the customer group price (3). {img type="fileId" fileId="316" thumb="box" width="100%"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_salespricing" with the name "Sales pricing" regarding Formation of a selling price: In the simplest case the price is a simple value per quantity independent of any variable. The price becomes variable through the use of a formula or price table, as the price is now formed depending on various attributes/data fields. In addition to the basic price, the price can be assigned surcharges and discounts. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_salespricing" with the name "Sales pricing" regarding Customer price agreement: Customer agreements can be reached via the sales role on the one hand and via the customer on the other. In the sales article, you can see the agreements which have been made with which customers for this article and the customer's condon for this. To create a price agreement, insert a customer in the customer tab of the sales role by clicking the "Insert" button. The price agreement is created automatically and the agreed price can be entered directly. (Info: Besides the price you can also enter the customer's article number here). The same functions (price history, detailed processing, price tables, ) are available for processing the price of customer agreements as for processing the item price. --- If the article is now inserted in an offer/order to the corresponding customer, the price of the agreement is taken over instead of the standard price. {img type="fileId" fileId="318" thumb="box" width="100%"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_salespricing" with the name "Sales pricing" regarding Customer conditions: In the "Conditions" tab in the customer editing window, it is possible to define not only shipping, delivery and payment conditions etc., but also discounts and surcharges. If an offer/order is directed to this customer, these conditions will be included in the document. If a surcharge/discount is declared as list price related, it will not be shown in the print and the reduction/increase in value will be allocated to the item price. The "hidden" condition thus influences the sales price without the customer being informed of this. [/INST]

5. How do I use the Condition feature in the Sales Pricing module to set up complex pricing rules based on factors such as customer, location, or product?
6. Are there any limitations on the amount of discounts or surcharges that I can apply to a single sale item in the Sales Pricing module, and if so, what are they?
7. Can I view a summary of all active price agreements for a particular customer in the Sales Pricing module, including the agreed upon price and any applicable discounts or surcharges?
8. How do I use the Price History feature in the Sales Pricing module to track changes to a sale item's price over time, and can I filter this data by customer or date range?
9. Can I create a customized price table in the Sales Pricing module that reflects my company's unique pricing structure, and if so, how?
10. Are there any security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of price agreements or other pricing data in the Sales Pricing module?

Module description: This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_sales_masterdata" with the name "Sales - Master data" regarding Master data: As usual, the master data of the sales department consists of a customer master and an article master. In ClassiX® the customer base is accessed via the 'Customer' icon. This opens the search mask of the customer base from which you can select existing customers or create new customers by clicking on 'New'. The article master consists of the sales types, sales articles, spare parts and service articles. This makes it possible to transparently display even products that are manufactured in many variants. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_sales_masterdata" with the name "Sales - Master data" regarding Sales set: Sales types can, for example, be end products that are made up of several assemblies. Conditional individual parts in sets Conditional individual parts can be included in sets. Characteristics can be assigned to these conditional individual parts, which later appear in the offer or order items. If no characteristics were entered for these conditional individual parts, the quotation or order item automatically takes the characteristics of the selected individual part from the parts master. Characteristics of the lower parts When sub-parts are added to sets, all characteristics of the selected part are copied from the part master into the characteristics of the new sub-position of the set. These can now be set as desired and are then valid for all quotation/order items created from this set, if the characteristics have not been explicitly defined and thus overwritten. Calculation and quantity calculation for main and sub-items There are five types (Types) of how subitems are assembled with the main item (see the "Type" field displayed on the first tab "Offer/Order item" if a main item has been loaded); this defines the pricing rules and quantity calculation.

Module description: This is the description of the module "attrslot" with the name "Preset attribute": A preset attribute wraps a dynamic data field with a value specification. This value is offered each time the preset attribute is used, but can then be overwritten individually. The type of presetting depends on the (data) type of the wrapped dynamic data field. For example, if the type is a STRING (character string), you can specify a text or leave the field empty. For example, if the type is CX_VALUE, you can specify the number of decimal places and the unit for the value. For enumeration types (enumerations: ENUMCHAR or ENUMSHORT) the value tables stored in the system (with binding to the dynamic data field) are offered for presetting. However, these tables can also be individually overwritten by the preset characteristics. The property of preset characteristics to manage their own tables also applies to other data types. For example, for a dynamic data field of type CX_VALUE, you can specify a table with values for the "width", such as "100 mm", "200mm" and "300mm". These values are then offered each time the preset attribute is used. If you want to allow only these values to be entered, you can do so by clicking on the "Exclusive" button.

Module description: This is the description of the module "txnhisto" with the name "Document history": The document history provides an overview of a transaction and the order of its subsequent documents. This enables a chronological overview which shows the chronological sequence of the individual transactions. Each document can be opened by double-clicking on it, or selected by single click. The possibility of displaying associations and transaction documents of the header document and the documents under items means that no important documents are lost in documents with different versions and levels just because they were linked incorrectly. {img type="fileId" fileId="438" thumb="box" width="100%"} Booked in: The list "Posted in" shows all monitors, states and accounts in which the currently selected document is posted. If a state is selected in this list, the graphical process history can be called up via the context menu. This shows which states in the assigned business process (workflow) this document has already passed through and which are still to come. This information is taken from the context of the document and interpreted. If, for example, the part is a part that must be inspected by master definition via a QA document after goods receipt, this QA step is also displayed in the open states. More on this topic in the documentation of process routes. associations: For each document, it is possible to link it with documents from the document master, local documents and, in the case of quotations/orders (+items), also operations. This is controlled via the context menu on the "Associations" list. There are three options to choose from here:Transaction: A transaction is created for the document and linked to it. For offers/orders, this document is automatically registered in the activity folder of the cost unit (project). The subject line of the created transaction is provided with the item number and supplemented by the internal database address of the item.(This is required so that a possible recipient of a mail created in this way can dragthis mail onto the ClassiX® background and the corresponding item opens immediately. This way the recipient knows immediately which position it is about and does not have to search for a long time (not implemented yet!!!)). For more information, please refer to the transaction document. Document (local): A document is simply attached to the document object and copied into the database. This copy of the document cannot be used for any other document and must be copied into the database again. In this way the same documents are created several times in the database. Document master (global): Via this menu item it is possible to create document copies or to use previously created copies for this document as well. For more information, please refer to the document master. With the help of the two buttons 'Fold all in (or out)' the whole tree can be viewed or folded up again.
