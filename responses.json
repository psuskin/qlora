Based on the information you provided, I can see that you are looking for information about the different types of attributes that exist in the \"attribut\" module.\n\nTo answer your question, the three attribute types in ClassiX® are:\n\n1. Preset material characteristic: This type of attribute is used to define a material characteristic that is predefined by the system.\n2. Calculated material characteristic: This type of attribute is used to define a material characteristic that is calculated based on other attributes or values.\n3. Conditional material characteristic: This type of attribute is used to define a material characteristic that is dependent on certain conditions or rules.\n\nIn terms of the input window, the window will vary depending on the type of attribute being created, but it will generally have the same structure and functionality. Each data field should only be used once to avoid unwanted results when integrating the attributes within the quotation and order items.\n\nRegarding the list window, it serves to list all the attribute objects that have been created. And for the selection window, it is used to select an attribute object to be used in the quotation or order item.\n\nI hope this information helps! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help!"

Based on the information provided, it seems like you are looking for information about a specific module called \"cxItemDemand\" and its relationship with \"Gozintographs.\"\n\nTo provide a helpful and accurate response, I would like to clarify that \"Gozintograph\" is not a commonly used term in the field of production planning and logistics. However, based on the context of the description you provided, it seems like \"Gozintograph\" might be a custom term used by a specific software system or company.\n\nRegarding the \"cxItemDemand\" module, it appears to be a part of a production planning and scheduling system that helps manage the demand for parts and materials in a production process. The module seems to be designed to automate the creation of parts lists, scheduling of provisioning, and the release of parts requirements.\n\nTo answer your question, I would suggest that you consult the documentation or user manual for the specific software system you are using, as it is likely that the term \"Gozintograph\" is not a standard term in the industry. However, if you have any further questions about the \"cxItemDemand\" module or production planning in general, I would be happy to help to the best of my ability.\n\nPlease note that I will not provide any information that may be harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal. All my answers will be socially unbiased and positive in nature. If I am unsure or do not have enough information to provide a helpful answer, I will let you know and suggest where you might be able to find the information you need."

This could be in terms of size, shape, color, material, or other features.\n\nFor example, a car manufacturer might offer a variant part for a specific model that has a different engine size or transmission type than the standard version. Similarly, a smartphone manufacturer might offer a variant part with a different storage capacity or camera configuration.\n\nIt's important to note that variant parts are not necessarily inferior or superior to the standard version, but rather they offer different features or specifications that may be more suitable for certain customers or use cases.\n\nI hope this helps!
