            "response": "Hello! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about ClassiX® and the \"attribut\" module. Based on the information you provided, I can see that you are looking for information about the different types of attributes that exist in the \"attribut\" module.\n\nTo answer your question, the three attribute types in ClassiX® are:\n\n1. Preset material characteristic: This type of attribute is used to define a material characteristic that is predefined by the system.\n2. Calculated material characteristic: This type of attribute is used to define a material characteristic that is calculated based on other attributes or values.\n3. Conditional material characteristic: This type of attribute is used to define a material characteristic that is dependent on certain conditions or rules.\n\nIn terms of the input window, the window will vary depending on the type of attribute being created, but it will generally have the same structure and functionality. Each data field should only be used once to avoid unwanted results when integrating the attributes within the quotation and order items.\n\nRegarding the list window, it serves to list all the attribute objects that have been created. And for the selection window, it is used to select an attribute object to be used in the quotation or order item.\n\nI hope this information helps! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help!"
