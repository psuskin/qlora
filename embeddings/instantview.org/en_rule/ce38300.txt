This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_INTEGER" regarding Description: This class is used to store an integer. The number must come from the value range -2,147,483,648 (= -231) to 2,147,483,647 (=231-1). From objects of the class CX_INTEGER data of the type INTEGER are to be distinguished: CX_INTEGER: INTEGER: 199051 Used on a INTEGER value on the stack a method is executed by call, then the INTEGERvalue for the call is implicitly converted into a temporary CX_INTEGER-object, on which the call then takes place. In this way, all the methods listed here can be used on normal INTEGER-numbers can be executed. It should be noted that the object only exists for the duration of the call and methods that change the object (e.g. DivAssign) only change this temporary object and thus have no effect on the INTEGER-value. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_INTEGER" regarding Code example: Operators The following operators are available for an object of this class: * MA = member access function, greyed out = inherited function * I = Indexable data field, greyed out = inherited data field.
