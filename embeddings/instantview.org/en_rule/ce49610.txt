This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_XML_PROCESSOR" regarding Description: Tool object for effective XML processing with InstantViewÂ®. CX_XML_PROCESSOR is a SAX parser. Rules tell the CX_XML_PROCESSOR object what to do when it parses a node of the XML file: a) Send a message -> Message Rule b) Call the method of an object -> Processing Rule c) create an object of a defined class, write the attributes into certain data fields and assign the newly created object to a parent object according to the XML hierarchy -> Transform Rule The example corresponds to the unit test testXMLProcessor.mod. For a real application see ProfilingNew.mod in classix\QM. If multiple rules are specified for an XML node, they are executed in the following order: 1. transform rule = create a new object - case c) 2. message rule = the object created with 1. is also sent - case a) 3. processing rule = call of a method, also here the object created with 1. is passed as a parameter. .
