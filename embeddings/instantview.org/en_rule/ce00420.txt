This is the description of the class "CX_FORMULA - Operators": Class CX_FORMULA - Operators, arithmetic functions There are the following operators: Operator Semantics Priority Remarks - Sign reversal 8 !Negation (logical)8negates a comparison result (class CX_BOOLEAN); bitwise negation for objects of the class CX_BIT_PATTERN. * Multiplication 7 / Division 7 + Addition 6also defined for strings: "abc" + "DE" results in "abcDE". - Subtraction 6 < Comparison: smaller 5 Result is an object of the class CX_BOOLEAN > Comparison: larger 5 Result is an object of the class CX_BOOLEAN <= Comparison: smaller-even 5 Result is an object of the class CX_BOOLEAN >= Comparison: greater-even 5 Result is an object of the class CX_BOOLEAN = Comparison: equal 5 Result is an object of the class CX_BOOLEAN != Comparison: unequal 5 & logical conjunction 4 for comparison results (CX_BOOLEAN) and objects of the class CX_BIT_PATTERN ^ exclusive Or 4 for comparison results (CX_BOOLEAN) and objects of the class CX_BIT_PATTERN | logical disjunction 3 for comparison results (CX_BOOLEAN) and objects of the class CX_BIT_PATTERN := Value assignment 2 if for conditional expressions 1 F() Function call 1 Call of an arbitrary function, for F stands the name of the function else for conditional expressions 0 The priority determines the order of evaluation, as long as a different summary of the terms is not specified by brackets ().
