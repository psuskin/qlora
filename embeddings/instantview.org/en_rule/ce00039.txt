This is the description of the class "CX_INTEGER - Comparisons": The following overviews show the comparison operators and the operands with which an integer can be linked. All operators return the result of the comparison as a truth value. Equality Larger Smaller Equality INTEGER = INTEGER = INTEGER <-> 2 = 1 = 0 2 = 2 = 1 2 = 3 = 0 INTEGER = CX_NUMERIC = INTEGER <-> 2 = 1,5 = 0 2 = 2 = 1 2 = 2,5 = 0 INTEGER = CX_PERCENT = INTEGER <-> 2 = 1% = 0 2 = 2% = 1 2 = 3% = 0 INTEGER = CX_VALUE = INTEGER <-> 2 = 1 piece = 0 2 = 2 pieces = 1 2 = 3 pieces = 0 INTEGER = CX_FRACTION = INTEGER -> 2 = 3/4 = 0 2 = 4/2 = 1 2 = 7/2 = 0 INTEGER = CX_FORMULA = INTEGER -> 10 = Formula = Number Note: Before the comparison is carried out, the formula is evaluated. The actual comparison is only carried out if the result is an object which may be compared with an integer. If this is the case, the result is a number . INTEGER = CX_CONDITIONED_BAG = INTEGER -> 10 = conditional object table = Number Note: Before the comparison is performed, the corresponding object is determined from the conditional object table. The actual comparison is only performed if this object may be compared with an integer. If this is the case, the result is a number .
