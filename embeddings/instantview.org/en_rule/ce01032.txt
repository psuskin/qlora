This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_COUNTER - Counter" regarding Description: A counter is used as a counter that has a specific current value and can be incremented or decremented by a step value. For representation, a counter can manage format specifications that are used according to the FString command. Counters can delegate the counter and formatting to other counters via the delegation field. This means that the delegated methods do not work with the counter value, step size, format of this counter but with those of the most delegated counter object. If the formatting is not to be delegated (but only the counter), then the formatting must be deactivated in the delegated counter via flags. Then the formatting from the output counter is applied again. A counter is deactivated if the output counter or the most delegated(delegation) counter has been deactivated via flags. A disabled counter is not changed by Incr/Decr and returns the largest possible INTEGER value. Format methods always return an empty string for deactivated counters. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_COUNTER - Counter" regarding Code example: * MA = Member Access Function I = Indexable data field.
