This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_OBJECT_SECURITY - Access rights for objects" regarding Description: While objects of the class CX_CLASS_SECURITY describe the rights of all objects of a class, CX_OBJECT_SECURITY objects can be used to define the rights for very specific objects. This security object is only responsible for the objects contained in objects. The subobjects specified in specialisations are only checked during the check of the access rights for objects (read/write/delete) if the object concerned occurs in objects. If several security objects in specialisations are responsible for an object access, then the last one always wins. This behaviour was different before Dll version 225901. Attention: During the check for the creation of objects of a class, the security objects contained in specialisations are always checked. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_OBJECT_SECURITY - Access rights for objects" regarding Code example: * MA = Member Access Function * I = Indexable data field.
