This is the description of the class "Management of a date period with date and string": The following program code shows the definition of a window through which a date period can be input and output. The start date is set with the help of the interface object Date and the duration with String. Since the duration is a value, all the input and output options listed there apply to it. In this example, this is done with the help of the InstantViewÂ® instructionsDrainWindow and FillWindow. Window(Win, 50, 70, 410, 37, T("Beispiel Nr. 3", "Example No. 3")) [ Var(sdate) INITIALIZE: CreateTransObject(CX_SPAN_DATE) -> sdate "9.12.2005 - 12.12.2005" sdate Put 0 sdate Get(duration) Call(SetPrecision) sdate FillWindow ] { Prompt(10, 12, T("Datumsperiode:", "span-date:")) Prompt(150, 3, T("Start:", "start:")) Date(CX_SPAN_DATE::this, 152, 11, 110) Prompt(270, 3, T("Dauer:", "duration:")) String(CX_SPAN_DATE::duration, 268, 11, 80) }.
