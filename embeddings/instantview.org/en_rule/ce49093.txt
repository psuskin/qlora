This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_LAZY_CREATOR" regarding Description: Objects of these classes must never be created manually. They are created automatically if a slave object is to be created with CreatePersObject or CopyPersObject. In this way the actual creation of the actual object is delayed until it is clear which object is the associated master object. This then controls where in the database the slave object is created. Objects of this class are therefore always transient. Because they do not correspond to the "real" object, no functions should be called or members should be set. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_LAZY_CREATOR" regarding Code example: Var(po, txn) CreatePersObject(CX_PURCHASE_ORDER) -> po CreatePersObject(CX_TRANSACTION) -> txn // instead of a CX_TRANSACTION a CX_LAZY_CREATOR is created txn po Link(transactions) // now the CX_TRANSACTION is created in the database (controlled by the PO) and linked with the po * MA = Member Access function, grey background = inherited function * I = Indexable data field, grey background = inherited data field.
