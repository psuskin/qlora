This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_ITEM - Cause" regarding Description:(Business Pattern - CX_ITEM, Business Pattern - ACCOUNTS): This class represents a thing, a part, thus - in contrast to the conceptual objects of the type CX_CLEARING_OBJECT - something "tangible". CX_ITEM objects describe parts or articles as they are real. They can basically be described by text and define only the basic unit of measure and other sizes that may be required. These specifications are then valid for the entire company, possibly even for all outsiders (therefore also derived from CX_REAL_OBJECT). In CX_ITEM (as in CX_ITEM_CAST) the "extension" by a characteristic object of the type CX_ATTRIBUTE_SET is permanently implemented. Such an extension is also possible for CX_STRUCTURE objects, so that you can organise characteristic strings. The different views - e.g. of the sales or purchasing departments, but also of various affiliated companies - are specified and overwritten by means of CX_ITEM_CAST role objects (possibly in connection with an OVERWRITING_REF). Code example: * MA = Member Access function, grey background = inherited function * I = Indexable data field, grey background = inherited data field * I = Indexable data field, grey background = inherited data field.
