This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_PERIODIC_DATE - Access functions for weekdays" regarding Description: The access functions Mondays(), Tuesdays(), Wednesdays(), Thursdays(), Fridays(), Saturdays() and Sundays() control the input/output of the weekdays. Their behaviour is nearly the same, so that Mondays() is presented here as an example. In addition, the functions OrHolidays(), AndHolidays(), OrNoHolidays() and AndNoHolidays() are available to encode holidays. As an alternative to these access functions there is the function WeekdayEnumMA(), which is explained in more detail below.
