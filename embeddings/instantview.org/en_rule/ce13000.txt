This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_SCHEDULE - Date" regarding Description: An object of this class can be used to manage an appointment. These classes are time-bound containers, they describe time-bound processes. They therefore know the time dimension and can hierarchise and organise in it. With a CX_SCHEDULE one describes something that happened at a certain DAYTIME, happen or will happen. With CX_SCHEDULED_TRANSACTION, a direct transaction can be specified directly. CX_CALENDAR takes account of the fact, that periodic or time-continuous transactions can be subdivided into themselves. are subdivisible and can therefore also contain temporal sub-transactions. CX_SCHEDULE Timed operation. scheduleTypeEnum determines type (match with type. HOLIDAY, VACATION, . in cxbsystm !). The temporal status of the operation is held in scheduleStatusEnum. dayTime determines the temporal dimension of the operation. is left to allow the same entry from different objects. together. (e.g. Workgroup-Period(Calendar)) CX_CALENDAR Using mainPeriod and subPeriods to hierarchise a calendar. Especially for business periods. If mainPeriod == NULL, then topmost "administrative" period, then also dayTime = NULL. CX_ACCOUNT_PERIOD Period dependent numbers, journal pages (possibly also in ACCOUNT_DOMAIN), Journal balance, etc. CX_STATE_PERIOD monitors and controls (??) CX_SCHEDULED_TRANSACTION On the one hand to schedule Transactions for future processing in a calendar, on the other hand to schedule transactions that have been carried out. to be able to manage them in an orderly manner OPEN: ====== GenerateSubPeriods(durationUnit, classID): Insert weeks below months. Automatic over/under of periods, e.g. insert quarters after months have already been inserted. have been inserted. LookUpDate(date) leads to the 1st entry (e.g. January) not appearing. Probably CX_SPAN_DATE::Compare() wrong ! CHANGED == termEnum -> scheduleTypeEnum termStatusEnum -> scheduleStatusEnum periods -> links. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_SCHEDULE - Date" regarding Code example: * MA = member access function, greyed out = inherited function * I = Indexable data field, greyed out = inherited data field.
