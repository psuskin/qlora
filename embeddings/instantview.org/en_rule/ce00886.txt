This is the description of the class "X_Inverse Polish Notation": (also called inverse Polish notation - after the mathematician Jan Lukasiewicz): If operators were to be understood as functions, instead of a + b simply +(a, b) writing. The brackets can also be omitted. Nevertheless, complicated expressions - which normally require brackets - remain unambiguous. From (a + b) * c will be * + a b c This is the "Polish notation" (PN) which Lukasiewicz dealt with for theoretical reasons. If the operator = function name is placed at the end, we get the post-fix notation or IPN: a b + respectively a b + c * Expressions in post-fix notation are less intended for the human eye, but they are interesting for computer science because of the existence of very simple and fast algorithms for calculation. For this reason, class CX_FORMULA uses this representation for the internal representation of the expression to be calculated.
