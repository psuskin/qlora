This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_SERVICE* - Service" regarding Description:(Business Pattern): This class represents a service. The CX_ITEM objects describe parts or articles as they are. You only define the base unit of measure and general Descriptions. This information applies to the whole company, possibly even for all outsiders (hence CX_REAL_OBJECT). In CX_ITEM as well as in CX_ITEM_CAST the "extension" is permanently implemented by a characteristic object of type CX_ATTRIBUTE_SET. Also, such a Enhancement for CX_STRUCTURE objects possible, so that you can create characteristic strips organize. The different views - e.g. of the sales or purchasing departments, but also of various affiliated companies - can be viewed using the CX_ITEM_CAST objects (possibly in connection with an OVERWRITING_REF) specified in more detail and overwritten. Inherited from CX_BUSINESS_OBJECT is 'allocations' (see cxmalloc.doc) In particular, the parts lists for a part can be displayed from different views will be different. From a sales point of view, the result is a set of articles, a function-oriented parts list from the design point of view, from the production a production-oriented parts list. CX_ITEM : Part attributeSet : Pointer to "extension" by characteristics (CX_ATTRIBUTE_SET*) pattern : allocation to pattern, if part belongs to a pattern (REL_1M to CX_ITEM_PATTERN::items) Function ID() returns uniqueID and characteristics. Function Attribute(s) returns the n.th entry in the AttributeSet. If there is a pattern, then the order of the attributes is determined by the order in the pattern. CX_ITEM_PATTERN: Pattern with associated characteristics (attributeSet) (pattern) os_list items : List of proficiencies CX_ITEM_CAST item : REL_1M to CX_ITEM::clearingObjects baseAmount : base unit of measure (CX_AMOUNT*) attributeSet : Pointer to "extension" by characteristics (CX_ATTRIBUTE_SET*) OPEN: ===== CX_AMOUNT* salesPrice or also CX_AMOUNT* purchasePrice are only available via slots defined.
