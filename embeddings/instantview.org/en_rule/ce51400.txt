This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_BASE64" regarding Description: This utility class allows binary files to be read into InstantView as strings. This is made possible by encoding the binary data of the file before the Base64 algorithm (see: Base64). The encoded string thus contains only printable ASCII characters. These can then be transmitted to web services, for example. In Base64 strings, line breaks are normally inserted every 76 characters to structure the message. These line breaks are optional and are ignored when Base64 is decoded. It is possible that the line breaks are not transmitted correctly (especially when using Base64 in JSON) and the data cannot be interpreted as Base64. Then the DDI field insertLineBreaks can be set to FALSE to prevent line breaks from being written. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_BASE64" regarding 1:1 copy of a binary file via Base64: * MA = Member Access Function * I = Indexable data field.
