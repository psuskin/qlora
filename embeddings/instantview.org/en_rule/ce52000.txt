This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_DATA_CONNECTOR*" regarding Description: When the CyberEnterprise Business OS is started, meta information on classes and data fields is read in. This information is available as objects of the classes CX_META_CLASS, CX_SLOT, CX_SPECIFIER and CX_MEMBER. Data connectors now connect these objects with each other on a higher level and thus describe the data entities actually used as a reference to a metaclass in each case (e.g. customers, invoices, parts) with their data fields (name, number, etc. as fixed class members or slots entries) and can also determine the access procedures to be able to read the objects of the respective data entity from the database. Data connectors also hold the reports (CX_REPORT objects) of the data entities. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_DATA_CONNECTOR*" regarding Code example: For information on the method directory (MDI) and data directory (DDI), please refer to the class documentation.
