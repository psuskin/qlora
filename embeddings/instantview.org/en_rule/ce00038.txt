This is the description of the class "CX_INTEGER - Arithmetic": The following overviews show the mathematical operators and the operands to which an integer can be linked (all results comply with the priority rules): Addition Subtraction Multiplication Division Addition INTEGER + INTEGER = INTEGER 10 + 2 = 12 INTEGER + CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC 10 + 1,4 = 11,4 CX_NUMERIC + INTEGER = CX_NUMERIC 1,4 + 10 = 11,4 INTEGER + CX_PERCENT = INTEGER 10 + 15% = 11(3.1) CX_PERCENT + INTEGER = Error 15% + 10 = not allowed(2.1) INTEGER + CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 10 + 1/2 = 21/2 CX_FRACTION + INTEGER = CX_FRACTION 1/2 + 10 = 21/2 INTEGER + CX_VALUE = CX_VALUE 10 + 15 pieces = 25 pieces(5) CX_VALUE + INTEGER = CX_VALUE 15 pieces + 10 = 25 pieces(5) INTEGER + CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 10 + 1 €/2 piece = 21 €/2 piece(5) CX_VALUE_PER + INTEGER = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece + 10 = 21 €/2 piece(5) INTEGER + CX_FORMULA = whole number or amount 10 + Formula = Number CX_FORMULA + INTEGER = whole number or amount Formula + 10 = Number Note: Before the addition is performed, the formula is evaluated. The actual addition is only executed if the result is an object which may be added to an integer. If this is the case, number is the result. INTEGER + CX_CONDITIONED_BAG = whole number or amount 10 + conditional object table = Number CX_CONDITIONED_BAG + INTEGER = whole number or amount conditional object table + 10 = Number Note: Before the addition is executed, the corresponding object is determined from the conditional object table. The actual addition is only executed if this object may be added to an integer. If this is the case, the result is a number . Subtraction INTEGER - INTEGER = INTEGER 10 - 2 = 8 INTEGER - CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC 10 - 1,4 = 8,6 CX_NUMERIC - INTEGER = CX_NUMERIC 1,4 - 10 = -8,6 INTEGER - CX_PERCENT = INTEGER 10 - 15% = 9(3.1) CX_PERCENT - INTEGER = Error 15% - 10 = not allowed(2.1) INTEGER - CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 10 - 1/2 = 19/2 CX_FRACTION - INTEGER = CX_FRACTION 1/2 - 10 = -19/2 INTEGER - CX_VALUE = CX_VALUE 10 - 15 pieces = -5 pieces(5) CX_VALUE - INTEGER = CX_VALUE 15 pieces - 10 = 5 pieces(5) INTEGER - CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 10 - 1 €/2 piece = 19 €/2 piece(5) CX_VALUE_PER - INTEGER = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece - 10 = -19 €/2 piece(5) INTEGER - CX_FORMULA = whole number or amount 10 - Formula = Number CX_FORMULA - INTEGER = whole number or amount Formula - 10 = Number Note: Before the subtraction is performed, the formula is evaluated. The actual subtraction is only executed if the result is an object which may be subtracted from an integer. If this is the case, the result is a number . INTEGER - CX_CONDITIONED_BAG = whole number or amount 10 - conditional object table = Number CX_CONDITIONED_BAG - INTEGER = whole number or amount conditional object table - 10 = Number Note: Before the subtraction is executed, the corresponding object is determined from the conditional object table. The actual subtraction is only executed if this object may be subtracted from an integer. If this is the case, the result is a number . Multiplication INTEGER * INTEGER = INTEGER 3 * 2 = 6 INTEGER * CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC 2 * 1,2 = 2,4 CX_NUMERIC * INTEGER = CX_NUMERIC 1,2 * 2 = 2,4 INTEGER * CX_PERCENT = INTEGER 10 * 15% = 1 CX_PERCENT * INTEGER = Error 15% * 10 = not allowed(2.1) INTEGER * CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 10 * 1/2 = 5 CX_FRACTION * INTEGER = CX_FRACTION 1/2 * 10 = 5 INTEGER * CX_VALUE = CX_VALUE 3 * 2 pieces = 6 pieces CX_VALUE * INTEGER = CX_VALUE 2 pieces * 3 = 6 pieces INTEGER * CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 10 * 1 €/2 piece = 10 €/2 piece CX_VALUE_PER * INTEGER = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece * 10 = 10 €/2 piece INTEGER * CX_FORMULA = whole number or amount 10 * Formula = Number CX_FORMULA * INTEGER = whole number or amount Formula * 10 = Number Note: Before the multiplication is performed, the formula is evaluated. The actual multiplication is only carried out if the result is an object which may be multiplied by an integer. If this is the case, the result is a number . INTEGER * CX_CONDITIONED_BAG = whole number or amount 10 * conditional object table = Number CX_CONDITIONED_BAG * INTEGER = whole number or amount conditional object table * 10 = Number Note: Before the multiplication is executed, the corresponding object is determined from the conditional object table. The actual multiplication is only executed if this object may be multiplied to an integer. If this is the case, the result is a number . Division INTEGER / INTEGER = INTEGER 4 / 2 = 4 5 / 2 = 2 3 / 5 = 0 Note: When dividing an integer by another, the result is divided without remainder , i.e. the division is an integer. INTEGER / CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC 4 / 2 = 2 5 / 2 = 2,5 3 / 5 = 0,6 CX_NUMERIC / INTEGER = CX_NUMERIC 4 / 2 = 2 5 / 2 = 2,5 3 / 5 = 0,6 INTEGER / CX_PERCENT = INTEGER 2 / 15% = 13 CX_PERCENT / INTEGER = Error 15% / 2 = not allowed(2.1) INTEGER / CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 10 / 1/2 = 20 CX_FRACTION / INTEGER = CX_FRACTION 1/2 / 10 = 1/20 INTEGER / CX_VALUE = CX_VALUE 4 / 2 pieces = 2 1/piece CX_VALUE / INTEGER = CX_VALUE 2 pieces / 4 = 0,5 piece INTEGER / CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 2 / 1 €/2 piece = 4 pieces/1 € CX_VALUE_PER / INTEGER = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece / 2 = 1 €/4 piece INTEGER / CX_FORMULA = whole number or amount 10 / Formula = Number CX_FORMULA / INTEGER = whole number or amount Formula / 10 = Number Note: Before the division is executed, the formula is evaluated. The actual dividing is only executed if the result is an object which is allowed to divide an integer. If this is the case, the result is a number . INTEGER / CX_CONDITIONED_BAG = whole number or amount 10 / conditional object table = Number CX_CONDITIONED_BAG / INTEGER = whole number or amount conditional object table / 10 = Number Note: Before the division is executed, the corresponding object is determined from the conditional object table. The actual division is only executed if this object is allowed to divide an integer. If this is the case, the result is a number .
