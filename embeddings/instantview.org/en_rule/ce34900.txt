This is the description of the class "CX_IMPORT_CONTEXT - ImportContext": 231135. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_IMPORT_CONTEXT - ImportContext" regarding Description: Objects of this class represent a concrete ImportContext. Such an object is obtained either from the widget itself (if an ImportContext is assigned to the widget) via CX_WIDGET::GetImportContext or from the (consumer) module to which the ImportContext belongs (defined therein or inherited from a base module) via CX_MODULE::GetImportContext or CX_MODULE: : GetAllImportContexts. Objects of type CX_IMPORT_CONTEXT belong to the module and are only deleted when the module is reloaded. If an ImportContext is overwritten by redefinition (e.g. in CompileWindow), then no new object is created, but only the existing CX_IMPORT_CONTEXT object is changed. Derived modules inherit all ImportContexts from their base modules. If a widget is imported without specifying a context, then a default import context is implicitly defined per provider. These contexts can be recognised by their name in the form "::providerTag". This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_IMPORT_CONTEXT - ImportContext" regarding Code example: Widget Call(GetImportContext) // -> CX_IMPORT_CONTEXT(.) Call(GetSourceRange) // -> CX_FILE_SOURCE_RANGE(.) TRUE Swap Call(Read) // -> "ImportContext(.)" * MA = member access function, greyed out = inherited function * I = Indexable data field, greyed out = inherited data field.
