This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_SECURITY_SET - Access group" regarding Description: (Business Pattern): Objects of this class are used to combine objects of the classes CX_CLASS_SECURITY, CX_OBJECT_SECURITY and CX_MESSAGE_SECURITY as well as other CX_SECURITY_SET objects. CX_SECURITY_SET is intended as a summary of security objects that combine access rights into a group of access rights. The CX_SECURITY_SETs can be nested within each other as desired. If multiple security objects define access rights for an object/message/class/system function, the override semantics apply and the last object defines the access. The access rights are not additive! Example: There are classes A, A1, A2 and B. A1 and A2 are derived from A, while B is independent of A: Access to objects of classes A, A1 and B are defined with CX_CLASS_SECURITY objects. For some instances of A1, different rights are to apply (CX_OBJECT_SECURITY). Possibilities to realise this are Both variants are semantically equivalent. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_SECURITY_SET - Access group" regarding Code example: * MA = Member Access Function * I = Indexable data field.
