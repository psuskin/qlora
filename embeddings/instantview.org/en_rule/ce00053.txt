This is the description of the class "CX_DATE - Comparisons": Description The comparison operators ">", "<" and "=" compare a current date with a date of any type. The following rules apply: A current date can only be the same as another current date. A current date is always less than a date period, unless it is after the end of the date period. A current date is always smaller than a periodic date, as the latter has no end. The above-mentioned (perhaps seemingly complicated) rules can be reduced to a fairly simple rule of memory. Two date definitions are equal if they contain exactly the same days. One date is always smaller than another if the two dates are not the same and its end is not greater than the other.
