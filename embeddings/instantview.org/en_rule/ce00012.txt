This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_LOCALE - Region-specific data" regarding Description:(Business Pattern): A region locale is used to manage all region-specific information. A "region" is any small geographical or administrative space, whereby a region can be subordinate not only to a state but also to another region, so that there is no limit to the nesting depth of locales. Thus, a refinement of regions can be carried out down to parts of a company. An example of this is the definition of working days, which can vary depending on the division of a company. While in production, Saturdays and Sundays may be worked on Saturdays and Sundays, and these days are therefore considered working days, Saturdays and Sundays may be considered non-working days in administration. The definition of the locale information is described here. By default, most of the information is undefined, so when this data is accessed, the values of the parent locale are returned. In addition to this, public holidays can also be defined for a region. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_LOCALE - Region-specific data" regarding Code example: * MA = Member Access Function * I = Indexable data field.
