This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_BITMAP_PATH" regarding Description: The class forms an interface of the image mapping to InstantView, which is managed by the Presentation Manager. The currently loaded mapping can be obtained using CX_PRESENTATION_MANAGER::GetBmpMapFromStorage. The mapping is loaded the first time a bitmap path is resolved. The mapping information - from CXSTRING.004 or the new imageMap.json - can be visualized, edited and stored in the imageMap.json. Objects of type CX_BITMAP_PATH do not hold the mapping information themselves. They only know their key and offer MA functions to access the corresponding mapping information of the presentation manager. To create a new entry, simply create a new object of type CX_BITMAP_PATH, the key must be set and then the new entry can be written to the imageMap.json with Save(). As the name Key suggests, no two entries with the same key may exist. * MA = Member Access Function.
