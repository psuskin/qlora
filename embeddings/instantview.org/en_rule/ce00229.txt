This is the description of the functionality of the class "Selection of a weekday combination" regarding Description: The following program code shows the definition of a window, which can be used to select any combination of weekdays. Special access functions for a periodic date are used for this purpose. To be able to enter several weekdays, the selection of a set of radio buttons must be allowed by the flag SELECT_MULTIPLE.
