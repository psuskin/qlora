This is the description of the class "STRING - Comparisons": The following overviews show the comparison operators and the operands with which a text can be linked. All operators return the result of the comparison as a truth value. Equality Larger Smaller Preliminary note: If two texts are compared, the letters are compared one after the other. A letter that has a higher ASCII value than another is "larger" than the latter (e.g. "b" is larger than "a"). As soon as two letters are not identical, this represents the result of the comparison. For example, the text "hello" is smaller than "hello" because the "e" in the second position is larger than the "a". If one text is contained in another, it is smaller, so that in this case the length of the text is decisive (e.g. "Hallo" is smaller than "Hallo Du"). Equality STRING = STRING = INTEGER <-> "abc" = "def" = 0 "abc" = "abc" = 1 STRING = ML_STRING = INTEGER <-> "abc" = T("abc, "def") = 0 or 1 Note: The choice of which text is compared from the multilingual text to the source text depends on the currently set language. Larger STRING > STRING = INTEGER <-> "def" > "abc" = 1 "def" > "hij" = 0 "abc" > "abc" = 0 "abc" > "ac" = 0 "abc" > "off" = 1 STRING > ML_STRING = INTEGER <-> "def" > T("abc", "hij") = 0 or 1 Note: The choice of which text is compared from the multilingual text to the source text depends on the currently set language Smaller STRING < STRING = INTEGER <-> "def" < "abc" = 0 "def" < "hij" = 1 "abc" < "abc" = 0 "abc" < "ac" = 1 "abc" < "off" = 0 STRING < ML_STRING = INTEGER <-> "def" < T("abc", "hij") = 0 or 1 Note: The choice of which text is compared from the multilingual text to the source text depends on the currently set language.
