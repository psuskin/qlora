This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_GENERAL_LEDGER - G/L account" regarding Description: This class maps a G/L account. Objects that determine the chart of accounts. A general chart of accounts for all independent clients is possible in principle by setting different domains for the monitors Account, with simultaneous common domain for the GENERAL_LEDGER objects. However, problematic in the area of bank accounts (various accounts), taxes (various tax offices) and reconciliation accounts (various debtors/creditors). Therefore, joint use of the GENERAL_LEDGER objects is probably only possible if one and the same company (client) is subdivided into business areas/profit centres. Cross-company evaluations via CX_STRUCTURE objects, which hold CX_ACCOUNT or CX_GENERAL_LEDGER objects from different layers. Layers. Set dunning areas, credit areas, business areas, etc. with layers and domains. generalLedgerTypeEnum: Implemented as a bit pattern: controls whether balance sheet/profit and loss account, asset/liability and/or expense/profit and loss account. NN: for mixed accounts (purchase of goods) active and also profit account can be entered at the same time ? Because of mixed accounts also no derivation of a separate P&L class. For cash discount account, expense/income corresponds to cash discount expense or cash discount income. generalLedgerTypeEnum also regulates the exchange between debit/credit. If, for example, a bank account has a negative balance (debit < 0), then Debit() returns NULL and the Credit() value is output instead. NN: hold the "usual" slots: here e.g. debit/credit, or do this only via function when coupling CX_ACCOUNT ???? The currency is held in the format of the debit/credit slot in the CX_ACCOUNT object. OP's also hold slot originalValue. APPEND !!! generalLedgerTaxTypeEnum: Enum as bit pattern: controls the possible tax processing with this account. Bit 2 holds gross/net processing, if 0 then default net (applies to cash discount gross-net procedures or down payment accounts). (see also 3.168 in Praxis-Lexikon BuchfÃ¼hrung + Bilanz). tax: In collection tax, all allowed tax types are kept for entries, if empty, then all allowed according to enum type. In CX_TAX_ACCOUNT direct reference to the tax key of type CX_TAX, which in turn is attached to CX_TAX_AUTHORITY. Likewise CX_CASH_DISCOUNT direct reference as cash discount account for control key. Hold down payments via special slots. APPEND !!! Summarisations of cost types (CX_ACC_CATEGORY objects) to G/L accounts via REL_MN clearingObjects and function GeneralLedger() from CX_ACC_CATEG. out. According to CX_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT summarisation on CX_CLEARING_ACCOUNT. ????: ===== possibly later a CX_PROFIT_AND_LOSS_ACCOUNT of CX_GENERAL_LEDGER. derive with list of P&L accounts, and also derive the P&L accounts separately. with BackReference. Control accrual accounts via generalLedgerTypeEnum ?? Flag neutral accounts somehow ?? This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_GENERAL_LEDGER - G/L account" regarding Code example: * MA = member access function, greyed out = inherited function * I = Indexable data field, greyed out = inherited data field.
