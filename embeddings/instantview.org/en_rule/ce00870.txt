This is the description of the class "Concept - direction in conversion tables": The direction indicates whether an operation is commutative ("<->") or not ("->"). The commutative law applies to addition and multiplication, if this is indicated by a "<->". For subtraction and division as well as for comparison operators, however, this sign means that the operation is also possible with swapped operands. If there is a "->" in the column, the operation is not possible with swapped operands.
