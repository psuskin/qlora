This is the description of the class "Date type table": The following table shows all available holiday types. If several types are to be addressed at the same time, their values are simply to be added up, e.g. "9" results if both dates and holidays are meant. When adding up the values, care must be taken to ensure that no constant can occur more than once. Data type constants Date type Constant Value General Partner Value (nothing) ALL_TERM 207 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 64 + 128 Date TERM 1 NO_TERM 206 = 207 - 1 Anniversary ANNIVERSARY 2 NO_ANNIVERSARY 205 = 207 - 2 Holiday HOLIDAY 4 NO_HOLIDAY 203 = 207 - 4 Holidays VACATION 8 NO_VACATION 199 = 207 - 8 Working day WORKINGDAY 64 NO_WORKINGDAY 143 = 207 - 64 (rest) REST_TERM 128 In order to save yourself the trouble of adding up all the others for the negation of one category, there are the NO_-constants. They also include the residual term (REST_TERM), so that days which are not in any category are also counted as these complementary terms. (e.g.: weekends that do not fall on a public holiday or similar). These constants are used to query the entries in the locales with functions such as IsWorkingday, or to define the categories of days for a date period to determine the period length.
