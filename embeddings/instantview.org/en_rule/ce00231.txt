This is the description of the class "Mapping of time": Three time object types are available for representing time. These each take over the representation of one of the following time specifications: Date and time Examples Object type name Time "10:20" CX_TIME Time span "From 10 to 11." : CX_SPAN_TIME Periodic period "From 10 to 11 every 20 minutes" : CX_PERIODIC_SPAN_TIME Note: In many other systems, date and time are often managed in a single object. In ClassiXÂ® this does not happen, as different time and date objects are provided. From these objects a time can be defined by any combination. This is managed with the class CX_DATETIME.
