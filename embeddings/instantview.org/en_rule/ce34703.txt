This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_OBJECT_DICTIONARY_ML_CI" regarding Description: The class CX_OBJECT_DICTIONARY_ML_CI corresponds to the class CX_OBJECT_DICTIONARY_ML, with the only difference that the search in the Dictionary does not distinguish between upper and lower case letters (case insensitive). An object can have any number of identifiers, and any number of objects can be entered in the Dictionary per identifier. Conceptually, a dictionary corresponds to a multimap. However, the dictionary retains the upper/lower case of the terms as they are entered. In the case of multilingual identifiers, it should be noted that they must be the same across all languages (case insensitive) in order to be recognised as the same identifier. This plays a role in the recognition of duplicate entries in EnterML and in finding the identifier to be deleted in RemoveML. Methods that work in a single language always refer to the currently active system language. (Enter, Query, Exists, Remove) CX_OBJECT_DICTIONARY_ML_CI belongs to the family of object dictionary classes. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_OBJECT_DICTIONARY_ML_CI" regarding Code example: * I = Indexable data field, grey background = inherited data field.
