This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_SPAN_TIME - Period of time" regarding Description: This class is used to map a specific time full stop consisting of a time and a duration. During generation, the current system time is used for the start time. A start time is normally between 0.00 and 24.00 hours. The duration is initially "0 hours", whereby various units, such as seconds or minutes, can be selected for the duration representation. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_SPAN_TIME - Period of time" regarding Display on screen: 1. use of a surface object of the type string. In this case, the object is specified in a single input field. The following illustration shows an example (programme code): Note: When entering a time period, the start and end times are separated by one of the following characters: '-' or '/'. 2. the use of two interface objects of the type DigitalTime, where the start time is entered in one field and the end time in the other (programme code). It should be noted that without additional interface objects only time spans with defined start and end times can be managed, i.e. specifications such as "from 10.00 a.m." are not possible. 3. the use of the interface objects DigitalTime and String, where the former specifies the start time and the latter the duration (programme code). It should be noted that without additional interface objects only time spans with defined start and end times can be managed, i.e. specifications such as "from 10.00 a.m." are not possible. In connection with these display options and certain InstantViewÂ® instructions, the flags belonging to the object play an important role, as they can be used to modify the display of the object. * MA = Member Access Function * I = Indexable data field.
