This is the description of the class "Access functions": Access functions to objects are required where the presentation of information cannot be fed directly from a data field of the object. Working with an access function differs from a normal function in that it cannot be called explicitly with the Call() statement, but is always bound to a surface object. It is automatically called when the InstantViewÂ® instructions DrainWindow and FillWindow are executed and independently controls the data exchange between an object and its input fields. Example: The SpanDateValidity() function stores and displays the validity of a business object in conjunction with a string surface object.
