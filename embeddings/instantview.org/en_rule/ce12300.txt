This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_OVERWRITING_REF - Overwriting Wrapper" regarding Description:(Business Pattern): This class is an overwriting wrapper. Usually the class is not addressed directly, but the InstantViewÂ® command WrapObject is used. The overwritten access expressions are managed by an instance of the class CX_ATOM_TBL (uniqueID = "Anonymous Slot"). Note: The Atom table is currently updated in a persistent CX_OVERWRITING_REF in the database when a slot is overwritten for the first time (the first time this overwrite path is used). However, the Atom Table is only reloaded when the database is opened and the Atom Table is expanded, so it is possible that a second client that was started earlier does not yet know the newly created slots and therefore cannot read them correctly. The problem can currently be solved by restarting the client or reopening the database. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_OVERWRITING_REF - Overwriting Wrapper" regarding Code example: To create a transient wrapper on a persistent object CreateTransObject must be used. The WrapObject command always creates an object in the same database as the target object. * MA = Member Access function, grey background = inherited function * I = Indexable data field, grey background = inherited data field.
