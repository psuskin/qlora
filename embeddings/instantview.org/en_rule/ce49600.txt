This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_STATISTICS" regarding Description: Auxiliary object for statistical evaluations. A CX_STATISTICS object receives a set of values (total quantity or sample) and provides methods for evaluation. The transferred values are any objects derived from CX_AMOUNT. CX_STATISTICS calculates with transient copies of the transferred objects. The object type thus directly determines the result type of Sum, MeanValue, Variance, VarianceBiased. The CX_STATISTICS object does not hold copies of the objects internally, but only updates the running mean value and the running error square with each insert call. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_STATISTICS" regarding Code example: Note: Multiplication with unit arithmetic currently has a poor performance! If all values refer to the same unit you can calculate with CX_NUMERIC:.
