This is the description of the class "Date Representation": There are three date object types available for displaying a date. These each take over the representation of one of the following date specifications: date Examples Object type name Current date "27.1.1997", "5 May" CX_DATE Date period "20.1.97 - 27.1.97", "1st calendar week 1997" CX_SPAN_DATE Periodic date "Sundays and holidays" : : : CX_PERIODIC_DATE Note: In many other systems, date and time are often managed in a single object. In ClassiXÂ® this does not happen, as different time and date objects are provided. From these objects a time can be defined by any combination. This is managed with the class CX_DATETIME.
