This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_META_CLASS" regarding Description: The objects of this class describe the classes in InstantView. They are managed by the Object Manager. If a meta class is not registered with the Object Manager, no objects can be created using the identifier of this class, because no class ID can be assigned to the identifier. To get the CX_META_CLASS object for a class, use the method CX_OBJECT_MANAGER::GetMetaClass. To create a new CX_META_CLASS object, use CX_OBJECT_MANAGER::NewMetaClass and not CreateTransObject. A detailed example of defining a metaclass at runtime can be found here. Since pseudo-classes are instantiated via their super-classes, this must be set in the DDI field "superClass" so that a pseudo-class can be instantiated. 230331, new classes/storages and files can be defined more easily via CX_OBJECT_MANAGER::ParseMetaInfoAdditive at runtime. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_META_CLASS" regarding Code example: * MA = Member Access function, grey background = inherited function * I = Indexable data field, grey background = inherited data field.
