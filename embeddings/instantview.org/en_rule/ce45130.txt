This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_HOLIDAY" regarding Description: Objects of this class serve as entries in objects of the class CX_HOLIDAYS (which in turn serves as an auxiliary object for objects of the classes CX_LOCALE ) and map rules to represent public holidays, holiday, company holidays, etc. Public holidays can be defined for each locale. Again, the definitions are applied in cascade: A locale inherits the definition of the parent locale. Your own CX_HOLIDAY object can extend or restrict this definition: e.g. add further holidays, remove a superior holiday definition, declare a holiday as a working day. Example: The defined holidays of a superordinate region (country) are first extended by definitions of a subordinate one (federal state). For example, in the case of "Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg", both national ("German Unification Day") and regional ("Corpus Christi") holidays are valid. But it is also possible to lift a holiday for a subordinate region. Furthermore, a public holiday can be declared as a working day. In the sample region, Corpus Christi is no longer a public holiday, and work is done on German Unity Day (which remains a public holiday). The holiday definition is done in the locales file locales.xml.
