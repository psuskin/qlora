This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_XML_OBJECT" regarding Description: This class is the base class of all XML objects and manages the pure XML as such without offering operations that work on it. The objects of this class, if created persistently, have a persistent and a transient part. In the persistent part the XML is stored as a zipped string. This part can be stored in the database and from it a complete XML object can be created again at any time. The transient part of the object contains the XML structure as internal object hierarchy. This is required to be able to perform changes on the XML. In order for changes to the XML to be accepted in the database, the function SaveXMLString must be called. This does not apply to the call of Assign. If the object was only created transiently, the object is still split in two, but both parts are transient and saving the changes is no longer relevant. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_XML_OBJECT" regarding Code example: * MA = Member Access Function * I = Indexable data field.
