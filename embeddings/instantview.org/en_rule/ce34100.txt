This is the description of the class "CX_FILE_SOURCE_RANGE": 230011. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_FILE_SOURCE_RANGE" regarding Description: Objects of this class represent an area in a source file and provide methods to read, overwrite or open the referenced code in the editor. The area is defined by the absolute path to the source file, as well as a start and end position. Both start and end positions are defined as (row:column), with both starting at 0. The first character of a file thus has the position (0:0). Important: The end position defines the position of the first character that no longer belongs to the selected source code area. This type of definition makes it possible, among other things, to select a certain line from a file without having to know how many characters this line contains at all (since the position of the last character is not needed for this). To select the 7th line of a file, the range would be defined as follows: (start=(6:0), end=(7:0)). This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_FILE_SOURCE_RANGE" regarding Code example: Var(sourceRange) CreateTransObject(CX_FILE_SOURCE_RANGE) -> sourceRange "evaluate.cxp" sourceRange Put(File()) FALSE sourceRange Call(Read) // ". whole file content." // now only read the 7th line 6 sourceRange Put(StartLine()) 0 sourceRange Put(StartColumn()) 7 sourceRange Put(EndLine()) 0 sourceRange Put(EndColumn()) FALSE sourceRange Call(Read) // ". 7th line content .
