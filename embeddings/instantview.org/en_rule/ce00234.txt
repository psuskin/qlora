This is the description of the class "CX_TIME - Arithmetic": The following overviews show the mathematical operators and the operands with which a time can be linked. Addition CX_TIME + CX_VALUE = CX_TIME -> 9.20 + 5 minutes = 9.25 Subtraction CX_TIME - CX_VALUE = CX_TIME -> 9.20 - 5 minutes = 9.15 If one time is subtracted from another, the difference is always output in hundredths of a second. CX_TIME + CX_TIME = CX_VALUE <-> 9.20 + 9.00 = 120000 s/100.
