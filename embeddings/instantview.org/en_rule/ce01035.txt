This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY" regarding Description: The class CX_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY provides the elements with which objects of the classes CX_CLASS_SECURITY and CX_OBJECT_SECURITY can describe rights for individual data fields. In the field name, not only the name of a data field but also a navigating access expression can be specified. The following additional generalisations apply to function calls and indexes: If function parameters are omitted: . . . a.Foo().b . then the object applies to all InstantView® accesses with expressions of the above form, regardless of the parameters specified for calling Foo(). However, if function parameters are specified in the CX_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY object, it only describes accesses with exactly identical expressions. If indices are omitted, such as in . . . a.collection[].b . . . the object describes the rights of all accesses with expressions of the above form with any index information. If an index is specified in the CX_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY object, it only applies to access expressions with exactly this index. Examples: see also ClassiX® Information Security System.
