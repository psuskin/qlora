This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_GUI_MANAGER" regarding Description: Since Dll version 4.5.2.166320 the GUI Manager is temporarily disabled, because of performance problems. The interface manager offers methods to adapt the desktop interface of ClassiX to your own ideas. The surface manager is constantly being extended with new functions. Up to now, it has been possible to redefine colours and set foreground and background colours. To ensure that all elements are displayed correctly, colour changes should be made once when starting ClassiX. If the colour changes are made in between, the windows have to be updated (resized) by the user, so that some elements take over the changes. The following keywords are permitted for colour names (parameter type COLOR): The order of the calls in the following example is irrelevant to the appearance of the interface. It does not matter whether the colour BLUE is redefined first and then the font colour is set to BLUE, or vice versa. In both cases, the font colour is set to the newly defined blue(0x95A4FC).
