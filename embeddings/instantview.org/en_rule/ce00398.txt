This is the description of the class "CX_VALUE_PER - Arithmetic": The following overviews show the mathematical operators and the operands with which a range value can be linked (all results correspond to the priority rules ): Addition Subtraction Multiplication Division Addition CX_VALUE_PER + INTEGER = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece + 10 = 21 €/ 2 pieces INTEGER + CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 10 + 1 €/2 piece = 21 €/ 2 pieces CX_VALUE_PER + CX_NUMERIC = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece + 10 = 21 € / 2 pieces CX_NUMERIC + CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 10 + 1 €/2 piece = 21 € / 2 pieces CX_VALUE_PER + CX_FRACTION = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece + 1/4 = 1,5 € / 2 pieces CX_FRACTION + CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 1/4 + 1 €/2 piece = 1,5 € / 2 pieces Note: When adding whole or real numbers to a range value, they "get" the same unit as the range value for the operation. The number is expanded to the same denominator and is added to the numerator. The "fraction" is not reduced. CX_VALUE_PER + CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 1 m/2 piece + 1m/4 piece = 1,5 m/2 piece 1m/4 piece + 1 m/2 piece = 3 m/4 piece 20 cm/1 piece + 2 m/1 piece = 220 cm/1 piece 2 m/1 piece + 20 cm/1 piece = 2.2 m/1 piece Note: When adding up values, the unit and denominator of the result is based on the first operand. CX_VALUE_PER + CX_PERCENT = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece + 50% = 1,5 €/2 pieces (3.1) CX_PERCENT + CX_VALUE_PER = Error 50% + 1 €/2 piece = not allowed (2.1) Note: When adding with CX_PERCENT, the percentage markup/reduction is only calculated with the counter CX_VALUE_PER + CX_VALUE = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 m + 2 €/m = 5 €/2 m CX_VALUE + CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 2 €/m + 1 €/2 m = 5 €/2 m Note: When adding with a CX_VALUE, the unit must match the unit of numerator/denominator, otherwise there is a unit error. The CX_VALUE will be extended to the same denominator and calculated with the numerator. The "fraction" is not shortened at the end. CX_VALUE_PER + CX_FORMULA = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece + Formula = Number CX_FORMULA + CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER Formula + 1 €/2 piece = Number Note: Before the addition is performed, the formula is evaluated. The actual addition is only executed if the result is an object which may be added to a range value. If this is the case, number is the result. CX_VALUE_PER + CX_CONDITIONED_BAG = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece + conditional object table = Number CX_CONDITIONED_BAG + CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER conditional object table + 1 €/2 piece = Number Note: Before the addition is executed, the corresponding object is determined from the conditional object table. The actual addition is only executed if this object may be added to a range value. If this is the case, the result is a number . Subtraction CX_VALUE_PER - INTEGER = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece - 10 = -19 €/2 piece INTEGER - CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 10 - 1 €/2 piece = 19 €/2 piece CX_VALUE_PER - CX_NUMERIC = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece - 1,5 = -2 €/2 piece CX_NUMERIC - CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 1,5 - 1 €/2 piece = 2 €/2 piece CX_VALUE_PER - CX_FRACTION = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece - 1/4 = 0,5 €/2 piece CX_FRACTION - CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 1/2 - 1 €/4 piece = 1 €/4 piece Note: When whole or real numbers are subtracted from a range value, they "get" the same unit as the range value for the operation. The number is expanded to the same denominator and is added to the numerator. The "fraction" is not reduced. CX_VALUE_PER - CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 1 m/2 piece - 1m/4 piece = 0,5 m/2 piece 1m/4 piece - 1 m/2 piece = -1 m/4 piece 20 cm/1 piece - 2 m/1 piece = -180 cm/1 piece 2 m/1 piece - 20 cm/1 piece = 1,8 m/1 piece Note: When subtracting values, the unit and denominator of the result is based on the first operand. CX_VALUE_PER - CX_PERCENT = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece - 50% = 0,5 €/2 pieces (3.1) CX_PERCENT - CX_VALUE_PER = Error 50% - 1 €/2 piece = not allowed (2.1) CX_VALUE_PER - CX_VALUE = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 m - 2 €/m = -3 €/2 m CX_VALUE - CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 2 €/m - 1 €/2 m = 3 €/2 piece Note: When subtracting with a CX_VALUE, the unit must match the unit of numerator/denominator, otherwise there is a unit error. The CX_VALUE will be extended to the same denominator and calculated with the numerator. The "fraction" is not shortened at the end. CX_VALUE_PER - CX_FORMULA = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece - Formula = Number CX_FORMULA - CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER Formula - 1 €/2 piece = Number Note: Before the subtraction is performed, the formula is evaluated. The actual subtraction is only executed if the result is an object which may be subtracted from a range value. If this is the case, number is the result. CX_VALUE_PER - CX_CONDITIONED_BAG = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece - conditional object table = Number CX_CONDITIONED_BAG - CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER conditional object table - 1 €/2 piece = Number Note: Before the subtraction is executed, the corresponding object is determined from the conditional object table. The actual subtraction is only executed if this object may be subtracted from a range value. If this is the case, the result is a number . Multiplication CX_VALUE_PER * INTEGER = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece * 2 = 2 €/2 piece INTEGER * CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 2 * 1 €/2 piece = 2 €/2 piece CX_VALUE_PER * CX_NUMERIC = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece * 2 = 2 €/2 piece CX_NUMERIC * CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 2 * 1 €/2 piece = 2 €/2 piece CX_VALUE_PER * CX_FRACTION = CX_VALUE_PER 1 m/2 piece * 1/2 = 1 m /4 pieces CX_FRACTION * CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 1/2 * 1 m/2 piece = 1 m/4 piece Note: When multiplying integer or real numbers by a range value, the numbers are only counted with the counter. The exception is CX_FRACTION, where numerator is multiplied by numerator and denominator by denominator. The "fraction" is not shortened at the end.

Division CX_VALUE_PER / INTEGER = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece / 2 = 1 €/4 piece INTEGER / CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 2 / 1 €/2 piece = 4 pieces/1 € CX_VALUE_PER / CX_NUMERIC = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece / 2 = 1 €/4 piece CX_NUMERIC / CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 2 / 1 €/2 piece = 4 pieces/1 € CX_VALUE_PER / CX_FRACTION = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece / 1/2 = 2 €/2 piece CX_FRACTION / CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 1/2 / 1 €/2 piece = 2 €/2 piece CX_VALUE_PER / CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE 1 €/2 piece / 1 €/4 piece = 2 (1.2) 1 €/2 piece / 2 m/ 1 piece = 0,25 €/m (1.2) Note: When dividing two range values, the result is given a new unit.
