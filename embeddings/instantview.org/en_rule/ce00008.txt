This is the description of the class "System settings": The settings of an application system may change depending on the location. For example, texts that are output during a programme run are usually displayed in German in Germany, whereas in Switzerland they are usually displayed in German, French or Italian, depending on the canton in which you are located. In ClassiXÂ® , location-specific information, such as the language just mentioned as an example, is loaded at system startup, so that the system can automatically adjust to the current location. Deviating from this, a user may prefer an output of texts in English, even though he is located in Germany, for example. In this case, the corresponding settings can be manipulated accordingly. The description of the location-specific data and how to access this data is explained in more detail in the following chapters: Initialisation file classix.ini Location-specific data (locales) Dynamic access to location data.
