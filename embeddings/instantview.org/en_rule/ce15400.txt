This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_ITEM_PATTERN - Pattern" regarding Description: Variant parts. Variant parts are parts that are combined to one part, which differ in some characteristics, but actually all represent the same part. A good example of this is the screw. There is only one variant part for screws. In the characteristics (properties) of the screw is now entered, what makes the different screws different, e.g. the thread pitch, the length, the thread type, the diameter, the material etc. So we have only one part with different characteristics. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_ITEM_PATTERN - Pattern" regarding Code example: Result: the subpart, if there is one in the variant part, that corresponds exactly to the characteristics of the attributes that the testTxn contains. If no subpart was found, the variant part is returned. If there are no attributes for the determination, an error is returned. This error can be avoided by either calling the function ItemWeak instead of Item, or by registering a message that is triggered when characteristics are missing (SetBindMessage). The following diagram shows how variant parts, distinct subparts and their attributes are usually connected in the ClassiX system (using the global attribute "WIDTH" as an example): * MA = Member Access function, grey background = inherited function *I = Indexable data field, grey background = inherited data field.
