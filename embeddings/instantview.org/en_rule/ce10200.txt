This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_CLASS - Model class" regarding Description: All business objects within the ClassiX速 architecture are derived from the class CX_CLASS. This class mainly serves as a base class for the polymorphism of the arithmetic and comparison operators of all objects in ClassiX速 and it enables the type-specific identification of all objects at runtime. Two main areas are derived from this class in CyberEnterprise速 : On the one hand, CX_CLASS derives the basic classes of the CyberEnterprise速 enterprise model. These are assigned to elementary and special data types as well as tool classes. On the other hand, the actual model classes are derived, which in turn are derived from each other over many levels: At each level of inheritance, the properties of the derived classes expand. For example, objects of type CX_SIMPLE can say something about their state, objects of type CX_TERMED can be restricted in their validity, objects of type CX_EXPANDABLE can be extended by any other attributes (the so-called slots) at any time and also have a unique identification. Finally, objects of type CX_STRUCTURED can be structured as required. Since all these classes are in an inheritance chain, objects always inherit all properties of all underlying classes. CX_CLASS cannot be used by itself, its functions and data fields cannot be accessed directly.
