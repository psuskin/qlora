This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_PHONE_MANAGER - Manager for telephone functions" regarding Description: A manager exists in the system that manages the devices of the machine that are available for telephony. ClassiX® uses the telephone API (TAPI), which is supplied with Windows95 and higher. To be able to use the full functionality, TAPI 2.1 or newer should be installed. For Windows98, Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 this version (or a newer one) is already installed, for Windows95 there is a corresponding update on the Microsoft server. All devices that can be addressed via the TAPI can be used by ClassiX® . On the one hand, these are devices on the local computer (e.g. modems and ISDN cards), on the other hand also devices on other machines (if the system is configured accordingly). Windows 2000 Server offers a service by default to make the own TAPI-capable devices available in the network, third party software offers a similar functionality. Calls can be initiated and calls can be waited for via the Phone Manager. The control of the individual connections is handled via the class CX_PHONE_CALL, whereby one object exists per connection. For each message that the phone manager triggers, the new CX_PHONE_CALL object is on the stack.
