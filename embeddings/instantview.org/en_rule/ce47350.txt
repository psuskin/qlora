This is the description of the class "CX_ERIC": 232855. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_ERIC" regarding Description: Due to changes in the ERiC API, this updated CX_ERIC class has major changes regarding the interface compared to the previous ERiC API realisation and is therefore not compatible with the old version. The class CX_ERIC belongs to the group of classes with which the interface to the German tax office is realised(electronic tax return = Elster). It provides the functions for creating, checking and transmitting tax returns The interface is implemented so that function names correspond to those of the ERIC API. Documentation for this: ERiC-API-Reference.pdf. The prefixes "Eric" or "Elster" of the function names are omitted in ClassiX. Thus, most functions return 1 on success and 0 on error, and the error text can be cancelled via GetLastError. Functions that return a string, such as MakeElsterStnr return NULL on error. Further information on the use of the functions can be found in the ERiC Developer's Guide.pdf. * MA = Member Access function, grey background = inherited function.
