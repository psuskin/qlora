This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_HTTP_REQUEST" regarding Description: class to make the various aspects of an HTTP request accessible in the InstantView code in an ordered manner. If a message is called via an HTTP request, an object of the type CX_HTTP_REQUEST is on the stack. The specification of an http request can be found at http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-5 The specification for decomposing the request URL can be found here: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.2.2 The class distinguishes between URL(Query) and body parameters. Query parameters are sent with the HTTP request in the URL in the form ?name=value&name2=value2. For HTML forms of type POST, the parameters are normally transmitted in the body. The content type is then set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded or formdata/multipart. If the Web service server detects such a content type, the body is interpreted and the body parameters are stored separately from the query parameters. In this way, a query received via the web service can be correctly reconstructed at SendRequest . This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_HTTP_REQUEST" regarding Code example: The http request would be forwarded to the following message implementation: Note that the original request path ("call_person") has been converted to capital letters and the method ("GET") has been appended to obtain the name of the message to be called. * MA = Member Access function, grey background = inherited function *I = Indexable data field, grey background = inherited data field.
