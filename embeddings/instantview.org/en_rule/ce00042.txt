This is the description of the class "STRING - Arithmetic": The following overviews show the mathematical operators and the operands with which a text can be linked. Addition STRING + STRING = STRING "Hello." + "World" = "Hello World" STRING + ML_STRING = STRING "Hello." + T("World", "Earth") = "Hello World" or "Hello Earth" Note: The choice of which text from the multilingual text is appended to the source text depends on the currently set language. This operation is not commutative. STRING + OBJECT = STRING "Hello." + 20€ = "Hello 20€"(6) Note: If an object is added to a string, the object is first converted to a string (see String command) and the result is then concatenated to the first string. This operation is not commutative.
