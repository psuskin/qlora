This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_INDEX_MANAGER" regarding Description: This class "keeps a record" of all indexes present in the database. An index can be deactivated individually, i.e. it is no longer used by the database. In fact, the index manager knows a set of index descriptions (implemented by CX_INDEX_DESCRIPTOR). These are an abstraction of the actual database indices. When an index descriptor is activated, the database index is created. Deactivation leads to the deletion of the corresponding database index. Accordingly, Add.Index can also be used to create index descriptors of indices that already physically exist in the database. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_INDEX_MANAGER" regarding Code example: * MA = member access function * I = Indexable data field.
