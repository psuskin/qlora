This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_FCONDITION - Formula condition" regarding Description: This class manages an "if.then" relationship by means of a tuple consisting of a condition ("if") and an object ("then") which is delivered if the condition is met. The condition is specified with the help of a formula , where the result of the formula must be a truth value . Objects of this class are used as entries in a conditional object table. Examples: Display on screen When representing a formula condition, it should be noted that it always behaves externally like its object, which is bound to the condition. The following example (program code) shows the use of two surface objects of type String to display the condition and the object. In this example it becomes clear that the formula must be accessed explicitly, because the formula condition for DrainWindow and FillWindow behaves like its object bound to the condition. * MA = Member Access Function Special functions within a formula expression * I = Indexable data field ยน) only if CX_FCONDITION is already an element of a CX_CONDITIONED_BAG object.
