This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_TERMED_VALIDITY" regarding Description: This auxiliary class represents the validity period of the object in ClassiX® system. The objects from class CX_TERMED onward have pointers 'validity': validity = NULL . validity unlimited validity = Object CX_TERMED_VALIDITY . Object only valid within the time interval The objects of this class are created implicitly with function SpanDateValidity() (of class CX_TERMED). CX_TERMED_VALIDITY inherits from CX_VALIDITY (abstract base class) the ability to combine several objects (CX_TERMED) with different validities into a cluster. When navigating to an object of such a cluster in the ClassiX® system, the currently valid object is automatically obtained (or NULL if no object of the cluster is valid).
