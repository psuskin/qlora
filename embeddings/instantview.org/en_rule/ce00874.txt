This is the description of the class "InstantView® concept - Compare function": All comparison operators that can be called for an object are based on the internal comparison function "Compare". This gives one of the following results when comparing: Result Meaning -1 the 1st object is 'smaller' than the 2nd object 0 the two objects are equal +1 the 1st object is 'larger' than the 2nd object Since this function is not called directly by InstantView® but only indirectly via the comparison operators '>', '<' and '=', knowledge of the behaviour of this function is only important in so far as the behaviour of the individual comparison operators is made transparent.
