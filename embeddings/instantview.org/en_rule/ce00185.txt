This is the description of the class "Management of a date period with two data fields": The following program code shows the definition of a window through which a date period can be input and output. A Date interface object is used for the start and end date. The contents of this object can be set with the function SetPeriodBorders. In contrast to objects of other classes, it is not possible to edit with DrainWindow in this case, because a date period internally consists of a current date and a period of time. Window(Win, 50, 70, 410, 37, T("Beispiel Nr. 2", "Example No. 2")) [ Var(sdate) INITIALIZE: CreateTransObject(CX_SPAN_DATE) -> sdate "9.12.2005 - 12.12.2005" sdate Put sdate FillWindow ] { Prompt(10, 13, T("Datumsperiode:", "span-date:")) Prompt(151, 3, T("Start:", "Start:")) Date(CX_SPAN_DATE::StartOfPeriodMA(), 151, 12, 110) Prompt(270, 3, T("Ende:", "End:")) Date(CX_SPAN_DATE::EndOfPeriodMA(), 270, 12, 110) }.
