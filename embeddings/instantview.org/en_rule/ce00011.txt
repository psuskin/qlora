This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_STATE_LOCALE - State-specific data" regarding Description: A state locale is used to manage all information specific to the federal states. By default, all settings are "set to zero", which means that the data of the (mandatory) higher-level country locale is returned in case of access. If a new federal state is to be included in the file CX_ROOTDIR\SYSTEM\LOCALES .TXT, the entry must begin with the keyword "STATE". This is followed by the definitions of the individual pieces of information. The stateCode and countryCode must be entered to identify the State-Locale unambiguously. The following list shows all information contained in a state locale and what the default setting looks like. The information in the file is given by the field name followed by an "=" and the desired setting. The changeover times from winter to summer time and vice versa are coded as periodic dates. By default they are undefined, as is all other information, so that when these data are accessed, the changeover times of the country are returned. In addition to this, federal state public holidays can be defined for a federal state.
