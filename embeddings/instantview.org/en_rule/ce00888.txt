This is the description of the class "X_Locale": A locale is a collection of location-specific information, including, for example, the output format of a date or the language used in a particular location. In addition, the public holidays that are valid at a location are also managed here. Since information of this kind does not always apply to a whole country (e.g. in certain federal states of Germany there are additional holidays, or several languages are valid, e.g. in Switzerland), there are several classes in ClassiX® to manage this information. The term locale in the ClassiX® system goes beyond the locales in C++ (std::locale etc.).
