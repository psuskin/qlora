This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_USER - User" regarding Description: This class represents a user. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_USER - User" regarding Cryptography Information: The user password is stored in hashed form in slot password.password and can be changed with PasswordMA(). With CheckPasswordHash it can be checked whether a clear text password matches the hashed password and with LoginHash the user can be logged in with his rights on the system. 196454 The hash algorithms currently available are "bcrypt" and "SHA1" and are stored in slot password.standard. This slot is automatically set to "bcrypt" by PasswordMA() if not set otherwise. If the slot is not set, the password is hashed with "SHA1". If the used algorithm is changed, then the password must be hashed again by a call to PasswordMA(), because otherwise the hash does not match the password anymore and CheckPasswordHash and LoginHash cannot work correctly. bcrypt is the cryptographically more secure hash algorithm and should replace SHA1 in the long term. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_USER - User" regarding Code example: * MA = Member Access function, grey background = inherited function * I = Indexable data field, grey background = inherited data field.
