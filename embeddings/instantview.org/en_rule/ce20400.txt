This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_MONITOR - Monitors" regarding Description: Monitors are - together with the set of rules for transaction descriptions - the central evaluation tool for vouchers (CX_TRANSACTION) . Whether accounting, inventory or time management, any statistics, transactions or business processes, everywhere one has to deal with an "account assignment" of vouchers or transaction data. The concept is strongly based on the 13 Codd's basic rules of OLAP (online analytical processing). A translation into OLAP terminology therefore looks as follows: In statistics literature, dimensions are also called categorising attributes, characteristics are also called numerical or summing attributes. In principle, no formal criteria can be specified as to whether an attribute is defined as an independent dimension or as a simple (usually summing) value. This is up to the design of the application and the evaluation of the data collected in the process. As an aid to this, it should be remembered that dimensions must be defined orthogonally to each other and should also, at best, themselves be subject to a hierarchical structure. Monitors can be 1-dimensional (accounts: CX_ACCOUNT) or multi-dimensional (CX_DATA_CUBE/CX_LOG_CUBE) . The 1-dimensional monitors (CX_MONITOR objects) register the changes of business objects caused by transactions. Each business object can be assigned to any number of monitors (REL_M1 relationship between CX_BUSINESS_OBJECT and CX_MONITOR). Monitors can be 1-dimensional (accounts: CX_ACCOUNT) or multi-dimensional (CX_DATA_CUBE/CX_LOG_CUBE). The 1-dimensional CX_ACCOUNT monitors are<->assigned to a business objectvia the ownermonitors<->relation. These accounts thereby observe certain values for the assigned business object and is modified by the set of rules of the transaction descriptions. Certain monitor types (CX_ACCOUNT, CX_LOG_CUBE) can register the transaction objects (CX_TRANSACTION) that change the values, so that the (cumulated) values collected in the monitor can be explained on the basis of the transactions (drill-down). Transactions are first assigned to a transaction manager CX_TXN_MANAGER which takes over the change of values and the registration in the monitors (singular dimensions of type CX_ACCOUNT) of the business objects that can be reached from this transaction. Multi-dimensional monitors are also managed and created by the transaction manager. It is important here that all desired dimensions must be accessible from each transaction. All monitor types have the property of splitting into further subordinate dimensions via the relation subMonitors. As an example, the division of a customer turnover statistic is shown here: Code example: * MA = member access function, greyed out = inherited function * I = Indexable data field, greyed out = inherited data field.
