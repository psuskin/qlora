This is the description of the class "CX_NUMERIC - Arithmetic": The following overviews show the mathematical operators and the operands to which a real number can be linked (all results correspond to the priority rules): Addition Subtraction Multiplication Division Precision The precision of the calculation is usually determined by the first value. 1,0 + 1,0000 = 2,0 1,000 m + 1m = 1,000m An exception is when a CX_NUMERIC meets a CX_VALUE or a CX_VALUE_PER. In this case the latter objects are of higher value and overwrite the precision. 1,0 + 1,0000m = 2,0000m 1,000 m + 1 = 1,000m Addition CX_NUMERIC + INTEGER = CX_NUMERIC 10,5 + 2 = 12,5 INTEGER + CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC 2 + 10,5 = 12,5 CX_NUMERIC + CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC 10,5 + 1,4 = 11,9 CX_NUMERIC + CX_PERCENT = CX_NUMERIC 10 + 15% = 11,5 CX_PERCENT + CX_NUMERIC = Error 15% + 10 = not allowed(2.1) CX_NUMERIC + CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 10 + 1/2 = 21/2 CX_FRACTION + CX_NUMERIC = CX_FRACTION 1/2 + 10 = 21/2 CX_NUMERIC + CX_VALUE = CX_VALUE 10 + 15 pieces = 25 pieces(5) CX_VALUE + CX_NUMERIC = CX_VALUE 15 pieces + 10 = 25 pieces(5) CX_NUMERIC + CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 10,5 + 1 €/2 piece = 22 €/2 piece(5) CX_VALUE_PER + CX_NUMERIC = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece + 10,5 = 22 €/2 piece(5) CX_NUMERIC + CX_FORMULA = CX_NUMERIC 10 + Formula = Number CX_FORMULA + CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC Formula + 10 = Number Note: Before the addition is performed, the formula is evaluated. The actual addition is only executed if the result is an object which may be added to a real number. If this is the case, number is the result. CX_NUMERIC + CX_CONDITIONED_BAG = CX_NUMERIC 10 + conditional object table = Number CX_CONDITIONED_BAG + CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC conditional object table + 10 = Number Note: Before the addition is executed, the corresponding object is determined from the conditional object table. The actual addition is only executed if this object may be added to a real number. If this is the case, the result is a number . Subtraction CX_NUMERIC - INTEGER = CX_NUMERIC 10,5 - 2 = 8,5 INTEGER - CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC 2 - 10,5 = -8,5 CX_NUMERIC - CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC 10,5 - 1,4 = 9,1 CX_NUMERIC - CX_PERCENT = CX_NUMERIC 10 - 15% = 8,5 CX_PERCENT - CX_NUMERIC = Error 15% - 10 = not allowed(2.1) CX_NUMERIC - CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 10 - 1/2 = 19/2 CX_FRACTION - CX_NUMERIC = CX_FRACTION 1/2 - 10 = -19/2 CX_NUMERIC - CX_VALUE = CX_VALUE 10 - 15 pieces = -5 pieces(5) CX_VALUE - CX_NUMERIC = CX_VALUE 15 pieces - 10 = 5 pieces(5) CX_NUMERIC - CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 10,5 - 1 €/2 piece = 20 €/2 piece(5) CX_VALUE_PER - CX_NUMERIC = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece - 10,5 = -20 €/2 piece(5) CX_NUMERIC - CX_FORMULA = CX_NUMERIC 10 - Formula = Number CX_FORMULA - CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC Formula - 10 = Number Note: Before the subtraction is performed, the formula is evaluated. The actual subtraction is only executed if the result is an object which may be subtracted to a real number. If this is the case, the result is a number . CX_NUMERIC - CX_CONDITIONED_BAG = CX_NUMERIC 10 - conditional object table = Number CX_CONDITIONED_BAG - CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC conditional object table - 10 = Number Note: Before the subtraction is executed, the corresponding object is determined from the conditional object table. The actual subtraction is only executed if this object may be subtracted to a real number. If this is the case, the result is a number . Multiplication CX_NUMERIC * INTEGER = CX_NUMERIC 2,5 * 2 = 5 INTEGER * CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC 2 * 2,5 = 5 CX_NUMERIC * CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC 2,5 * 1,2 = 3 CX_NUMERIC * CX_PERCENT = CX_NUMERIC 2 * 15% = 0,3 CX_PERCENT * CX_NUMERIC = Error 15% * 2 = not allowed(2.1) CX_NUMERIC * CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 10 * 1/2 = 5 CX_FRACTION * CX_NUMERIC = CX_FRACTION 1/2 * 10 = 5 CX_NUMERIC * CX_VALUE = CX_VALUE 2,5 * 2 pieces = 5 pieces CX_VALUE * CX_NUMERIC = CX_VALUE 2 pieces * 2,5 = 5 pieces CX_NUMERIC * CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 10 * 1 €/2 piece = 10 €/2 piece CX_VALUE_PER * CX_NUMERIC = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece * 10 = 10 €/2 piece CX_NUMERIC * CX_FORMULA = CX_NUMERIC or CX_VALUE 10 * Formula = Number CX_FORMULA * CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC or CX_VALUE Formula * 10 = Number Note: Before the multiplication is performed, the formula is evaluated. The actual multiplication is only carried out if the result is an object which may be multiplied to a real number. If this is the case, number is the result. CX_NUMERIC * CX_CONDITIONED_BAG = CX_NUMERIC or CX_VALUE 10 * conditional object table = Number CX_CONDITIONED_BAG * CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC or CX_VALUE conditional object table * 10 = Number Note: Before the multiplication is executed, the corresponding object is determined from the conditional object table. The actual multiplication is only executed if this object may be multiplied to a real number. If this is the case, the result is a number . Division CX_NUMERIC / INTEGER = CX_NUMERIC 2,5 / 2 = 1,25 INTEGER / CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC 2 / 2,5 = 0,8 CX_NUMERIC / CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC 2,5 / 1,2 = 2,08333333 CX_NUMERIC / CX_PERCENT = CX_NUMERIC 2 / 15% = 13,333333 CX_PERCENT / CX_NUMERIC = Error 15% / 2 = not allowed(2.1) CX_NUMERIC / CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 10 / 1/2 = 20 CX_FRACTION / CX_NUMERIC = CX_FRACTION 1/2 / 10 = 1/20 CX_NUMERIC / CX_VALUE = CX_VALUE 2,5 / 2 pieces = 1,25 1/piece CX_VALUE / CX_NUMERIC = CX_VALUE 2 pieces / 2,5 = 0,8 piece CX_NUMERIC / CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 2,5 / 1 €/2 piece = 5 pieces/1 € CX_VALUE_PER / CX_NUMERIC = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece / 2,5 = 1 €/5 piece CX_NUMERIC / CX_FORMULA = CX_NUMERIC or CX_VALUE 10 / Formula = Number CX_FORMULA / CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC or CX_VALUE Formula / 10 = Number Note: Before the division is executed, the formula is evaluated. The actual division is only executed if the result is an object which is allowed to divide a real number. If this is the case, the result is a number .
