This is the description of the class "Conditional object table with column division": The following program code shows the definition of a window in which a conditional object table with column division is displayed in an Object Box. It is assumed that the conditional object table table contains the shown data. Note: A "remainder" belonging to the formula is addressed by the column name "expr". The following table shows some examples: Formula Defined columns Rest "expr" x < 5 & y > 7 x, y x < 5 & y > 7 & sin( z ) = 1 x, y sin( z ) = 1 x < 5 | y > 7 x, y Error, because no "and-link (x < 5 | y > 7) x, y (x < 5 | y > 7) no error, due to parentheses in the printout If the names of the columns cannot be specified because different conditional object tables are to be displayed in one and the same Object Box, the following changes can be made: A format specification does not include the name, but only the number of the column it is to display. For example {CODE( theme="default")}[ Path(CX_FCONDITION::Bestellmenge) 13 BLUE ] SetFormat{CODE} through: {CODE( theme="default")}[ Path(CX_FCONDITION::0) 13 BLUE ] SetFormat{CODE} replaced. This means that always the first defined column of a conditional object table is displayed in this column. If the flag AUTO_POSITION is used for the object box and column numbers instead of names are used for the format specification, on the one hand the X-coordinates for the positioning of the columns and the naming of the columns in the header are omitted, so that the above program can also look like this.
