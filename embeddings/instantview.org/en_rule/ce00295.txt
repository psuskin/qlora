This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_PERIODIC_SPAN_TIME - Periodic period" regarding Description: This class is used to map a set of points in time that are in a certain time span and follow each other at exactly equal intervals. A start time is required in any case. If no end time is specified, it is automatically set to 24:00/0:00. Periods without start, as well as without start and end, will result in an error message. Example: The periodic time span "from 10.00 to 11.00 every 20 minutes" includes the time span "from 10.00 to 11.00", which is visualised in the following diagram. In addition, it also keeps the interval "20 minutes", which describes certain points in time within the time span. This time specification describes the time points "10.00, 10.20, 10.40 and 11.00", as shown in the following figure. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_PERIODIC_SPAN_TIME - Periodic period" regarding Code example: Display on screen Since this class is derived from CX_SPAN_TIME, the options described there can be used to input/output the time period. Furthermore, the frequency, i.e. the distance between the individual points in time, must be defined. Since this field is of type CX_VALUE, the input/output can be done in the way shown there. In connection with these display options and certain InstantViewÂ®instructions, the flags belonging to the object play an important role, as they can be used to modify the display of the object. Operators The following operators are available for an object of this class: * MA = Member Access Function * I = Indexable data field.
