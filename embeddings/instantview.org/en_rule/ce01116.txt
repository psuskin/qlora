This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_INDEX_DESCRIPTOR" regarding Description: This class represents an entry in the Index Manager and describes a database index. CX_INDEX_DESCRIPTOR objects cannot be created with CreateTransObject or CreatePersObject; they are created when indices are created via the Index Manager. This class represents an abstraction of the actual database indices. If an index descriptor is activated, the database index is created. Deactivation leads to the deletion of the corresponding database index. The connection between database index and the corresponding CX_INDEX_DESCRIPTOR object can be lost under certain circumstances (e.g. by physically deleting a CX_INDEX_DESCRIPTOR from the database bypassing ClassiX or by using database tools to change indices). In this case, a CX_INDEX_DESCRIPTOR object corresponding to the index can be created via the Index Manager (if it does not already exist) and these can be synchronised again with the physical index using the UpdateStatus or UpdateFlags functions. A CX_INDEX_DESCRIPTOR object is read-only. The UpdateREPIndex function can be used to modify it. The index descriptors are not only information objects (about the database indexes), but they are also used to explicitly update a database index with the retrieve feature. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_INDEX_DESCRIPTOR" regarding Code example: * MA = Member Access Function * I = Indexable data field.
