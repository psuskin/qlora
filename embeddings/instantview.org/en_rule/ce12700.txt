This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_FORMULA_ATTRIBUTE - Calculated attribute" regarding Description: A calculated attribute allows the contents of a slot to be filled by a formula. It also provides a more detailed description of this field. An example of this is the definition of an article "carpet", which, in addition to a length and width specification, contains the data field "carpet size", which is calculated from the first two sizes according to the formula "area = length x width". This formula is stored once in the system and can be used in a specific context by means of a formula attribute. Example: Different area specifications (e.g. carpet size and floor space) based on a slot area which contains the formula "area = length x width A CX_FORMULA_ATTRIBUTE can be given the parameters for its own formula, e.g. sub-formulae such as (l=) a + 5, where a is a slot in the CX_FORMULA_ATTRIBUTE. a could therefore be a conditioned bag itself: attribute area = attribute length * attribute width. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_FORMULA_ATTRIBUTE - Calculated attribute" regarding Code example: * MA = Member Access function, grey background = inherited function * I = Indexable data field, grey background = inherited data field.
