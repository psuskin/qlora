This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_HTTP_RESPONSE" regarding Description: Class to assemble an HTTP response (consisting of status code, header and body) in InstantView code via method calls. At the end of a message that handles an HTTP request, the Web service server expects either a string returned with ReturnStack and implicitly converted into an HTTP response object with status code 200. Alternatively, a CX_HTTP_RESPONSE object can be returned directly with ReturnStack . When an HTTP request is sent via SendRequest , the server response is placed on the stack as a CX_HTTP_RESPONSE object. The specification of an HTTP response can be found at http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-6.
