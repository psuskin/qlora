This is the description of the class "CX_FRACTION - Arithmetic": The following overviews show the mathematical operators and the operands to which a fraction can be linked (all results comply with the priority rules): Addition Subtraction Multiplication Division Addition CX_FRACTION + INTEGER = CX_FRACTION 1/2 + 2 = 5/2 INTEGER + CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 2 + 1/2 = 5/2 CX_FRACTION + CX_NUMERIC = CX_FRACTION 1/2 + 10 = 21/2 CX_NUMERIC + CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 10 + 1/2 = 21/2 CX_FRACTION + CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4 CX_FRACTION + CX_PERCENT = CX_FRACTION 1/2 + 50% = 3/4 CX_PERCENT + CX_FRACTION = Error 50% + 1/2 = not allowed(2.1) CX_FRACTION + CX_VALUE = CX_VALUE 1/2 + 10 pieces = 10,5 pieces(5) CX_VALUE + CX_FRACTION = CX_VALUE 10 pieces + 1/2 = 10,5 pieces(5) CX_FRACTION + CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 1/2 + 1 €/2 piece = 2 €/2 piece(5) CX_VALUE_PER + CX_FRACTION = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece + 1/2 = 2 €/2 piece(5) CX_FRACTION + CX_FORMULA = CX_NUMERIC or CX_FRACTION 1/2 + Formula = Number CX_FORMULA + CX_FRACTION = CX_NUMERIC or CX_FRACTION Formula + 1/2 = Number Note: Before the addition is performed, the formula is evaluated. The actual addition is only executed if the result is an object which may be added to a fraction. If this is the case, number is the result. CX_FRACTION + CX_CONDITIONED_BAG = CX_NUMERIC or CX_FRACTION 1/2 + conditional object table = Number CX_CONDITIONED_BAG + CX_FRACTION = CX_NUMERIC or CX_FRACTION conditional object table + 1/2 = Number Note: Before the addition is executed, the corresponding object is determined from the conditional object table. The actual addition is only executed if this object may be added to a fractional number. If this is the case, the result is a number . Subtraction CX_FRACTION - INTEGER = CX_FRACTION 1/2 - 2 = -3/2 INTEGER - CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 2 - 1/2 = 3/2 CX_FRACTION - CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4 CX_FRACTION - CX_NUMERIC = CX_FRACTION 1/2 - 10 = -19/2 CX_NUMERIC - CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 10 - 1/2 = 19/2 CX_FRACTION - CX_PERCENT = CX_FRACTION 1/2 - 50% = 1/4 CX_PERCENT - CX_FRACTION = Error 50% - 1/2 = not allowed(2.1) CX_FRACTION - CX_VALUE = CX_VALUE 1/2 - 15 pieces = -14.5 pieces(5) CX_VALUE - CX_FRACTION = CX_VALUE 15 pieces - 1/2 = 14,5 pieces(5) CX_FRACTION - CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 1/2 - 1 €/4 piece = 1 €/4 piece(5) CX_VALUE_PER - CX_FRACTION = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/4 piece - 1/2 = -1 €/4 piece(5) CX_FRACTION - CX_FORMULA = CX_NUMERIC or CX_FRACTION 1/2 - Formula = Number CX_FORMULA - CX_FRACTION = CX_NUMERIC or CX_FRACTION Formula - 1/2 = Number Note: Before the subtraction is performed, the formula is evaluated. The actual subtraction is only executed if the result is an object which may be subtracted to a fraction. If this is the case, number is the result. CX_FRACTION - CX_CONDITIONED_BAG = CX_NUMERIC or CX_FRACTION 1/2 - conditional object table = Number CX_CONDITIONED_BAG - CX_FRACTION = CX_NUMERIC or CX_FRACTION conditional object table - 1/2 = Number Note: Before the subtraction is executed, the corresponding object is determined from the conditional object table. The actual subtraction is only executed if this object may be subtracted to a fraction. If this is the case, the result is a number . Multiplication CX_FRACTION * INTEGER = CX_FRACTION 1/2 * 2 = 1 INTEGER * CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 2 * 1/2 = 1 CX_FRACTION * CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 CX_FRACTION * CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC 1/2 * 2 = 1 CX_NUMERIC * CX_FRACTION = CX_NUMERIC 2 * 1/2 = 1 CX_FRACTION * CX_PERCENT = CX_FRACTION 1/2 * 50% = 1/4 CX_PERCENT * CX_FRACTION = Error 50% * 1/2 = not allowed(2.1) CX_FRACTION * CX_VALUE = CX_VALUE 1/2 * 2 pieces = 1 piece CX_VALUE * CX_FRACTION = CX_VALUE 2 pieces * 1/2 = 1 piece CX_FRACTION * CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 1/2 * 1 €/2 piece = 1 €/4 piece CX_VALUE_PER * CX_FRACTION = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece * 1/2 = 1 €/4 piece CX_FRACTION * CX_FORMULA = CX_NUMERIC, CX_VALUE or CX_PERCENT 1/2 * Formula = Number CX_FORMULA * CX_FRACTION = CX_NUMERIC, CX_VALUE or CX_PERCENT Formula * 1/2 = Number Note: Before the multiplication is performed, the formula is evaluated. The actual multiplication is only executed if the result is an object which may be multiplied to a fraction. If this is the case, number is the result. CX_FRACTION * CX_CONDITIONED_BAG = CX_NUMERIC, CX_VALUE or CX_FRACTION 1/2 * conditional object table = Number CX_CONDITIONED_BAG * CX_FRACTION = CX_NUMERIC, CX_VALUE or CX_FRACTION conditional object table * 1/2 = Number Note: Before the multiplication is executed, the corresponding object is determined from the conditional object table. The actual multiplication is only executed if this object may be multiplied to a fraction. If this is the case, the result is a number . Division CX_FRACTION / INTEGER = CX_FRACTION 1/2 / 2 = 1/4 INTEGER / CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 2 / 1/2 = 4 CX_FRACTION / CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 1/2 / 1/4 = 2 CX_FRACTION / CX_NUMERIC = CX_FRACTION 1/2 / 2 = 1/4 CX_NUMERIC / CX_FRACTION = CX_FRACTION 2 / 1/2 = 4 CX_FRACTION / CX_PERCENT = CX_FRACTION 1/2 / 50% = 1 CX_PERCENT / CX_FRACTION = Error 50% / 1/2 = not allowed(2.1) CX_FRACTION / CX_VALUE = CX_VALUE 1/2 / 2 pieces = 0,25 pieces CX_VALUE / CX_FRACTION = CX_VALUE 2 pieces / 1/2 = 4 pieces CX_FRACTION / CX_VALUE_PER = CX_VALUE_PER 1/2 / 1 €/2 piece = 2 pieces/2 € CX_VALUE_PER / CX_FRACTION = CX_VALUE_PER 1 €/2 piece / 1/2 = 2 €/2 piece CX_FRACTION / CX_FORMULA = CX_NUMERIC, CX_VALUE or CX_FRACTION 1/2 / Formula = Number CX_FORMULA / CX_FRACTION = CX_NUMERIC, CX_VALUE or CX_FRACTION Formula / 1/2 = Number Note: Before the division is executed, the formula is evaluated. The actual dividing is only executed if the result is an object which is allowed to divide a fraction. If this is the case, the result is a number . CX_FRACTION / CX_CONDITIONED_BAG = CX_NUMERIC, CX_VALUE or CX_FRACTION 1/2 / conditional object table = Number CX_CONDITIONED_BAG / CX_FRACTION = CX_NUMERIC, CX_VALUE or CX_FRACTION conditional object table / 1/2 = Number Note: Before the division is executed, the corresponding object is determined from the conditional object table. The actual division is only executed if this object is allowed to divide a fractional number. If this is the case, the result is a number .
