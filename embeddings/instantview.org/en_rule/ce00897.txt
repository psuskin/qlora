This is the description of the class "Time Formats": ClassiXÂ® supports two time formats: the international "24 hours" format and the "12 hours" format, which is particularly common in Anglo-Saxon countries. In the "24 hours" format, a time between 0.00 and 24.00 hours is given. In the "12 hours" format, there is an additional indication of whether the time applies to the morning: 'am' (= ante meridian) or the afternoon: pm (= post meridian). The time 24.00 (or 12.00 pm) is equal to the start of the following day, i.e. 0.00 (or 0.00 on).
