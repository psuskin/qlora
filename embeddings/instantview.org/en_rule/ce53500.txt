This is the description of the class "CX_PRESENTATION_MANAGER": 169434. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_PRESENTATION_MANAGER" regarding Description: The Presentation Manager takes care of the native presentation of ClassiX. This includes that bitmaps and cursors can be exchanged and window positions can be saved. Furthermore, the presentation manager allows to set an application-global window title suffix/prefix. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_PRESENTATION_MANAGER" regarding Icons / Bitmaps: Basis for the exchange of the bitmaps is the BmpIndex, which determines which set of bitmaps is used. The sets are defined via CX_BITMAP, CX_BITMAP2 etc. For widgets with icons, the name of a .bmp or .png file is specified in the definition in the InstantView code. These file names in InstantView code can be mapped to different sets of other file names. ClassiX then knows different sets of images for the user interface. The Presentation Manager is used to select the currently applicable set. Important: the mapping forms one filename on another, not a complete path. This feature is optional! The assignment (name in IV code) â†’ { IconFile1, IconFIle2, . . . } is described with Excel. From this, the mapping file imageMap.json can be generated (see prsntmgr.mod and method CX_BITMAP_PATH::Save). This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_PRESENTATION_MANAGER" regarding Paths: The rule for fallback applies if the mapping feature is not active or if no image file was found where it was expected:. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_PRESENTATION_MANAGER" regarding Cursor: The cursors for running read/write transactions are configurable via the Presentation Manager and can be exchanged with own cursor files (via LoadCursorFromFile). The original cursors can be restored via RestoreROCursor/RestoreRWCursor.
