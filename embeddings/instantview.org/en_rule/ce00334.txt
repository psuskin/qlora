This is the description of the class "Amounts": Five payment object types are available for mapping amounts. Each of these takes on the representation of one of the following number types. In addition to these objects, there is also an elementary data type INTEGER, with which integer numbers can be held, as well as the object types formula and conditional object table, which do not belong directly to this area, since they are not only used to manage numbers. Number Examples Object type name Real number "2,5" CX_NUMERIC Percentage figure "20%" CX_PERCENT Area percentage "20% off DM 5" CX_PERCENT_PER Value "DM 4.89" CX_VALUE Area value "2 DM per 5 pieces" CX_VALUE_PER Fraction "1/2" CX_FRACTION The hierarchy of these object types is shown in the following figure. It becomes obvious that all object types for the management of numbers have a common base class CX_AMOUNT . This allows abstraction from the representation of a number, i.e. by using CX_AMOUNT within a class, any of these number objects can be stored there.
