This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_BIT_PATTERN" regarding Description: This class maps a bit pattern in the system. The bit pattern is a combination of bits, often used to indicate the possible unique combinations of a certain number of bits. A pattern of 32 bits exactly 232 combinations is allowed. {DIV( type="span" class="dllversion")}197959{DIV} For example, a CX_BIT_PATTERN can also be used in an enumeration widget by selecting individual bits of the CX_BIT_PATTERN using an access expression:. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_BIT_PATTERN" regarding Further notes on semantics: Unlike CX_INTEGER, a CX_BIT_PATTERN object for if and ifnot always evaluates to TRUE (regardless of the value). CX_BIT_PATTERN supports the following operators: These operators also support the linking of INTEGER or CX_INTEGER with a CX_BIT_PATTERN. For this, the numerical value is automatically converted into a bit pattern before the operation. The result of these operators is always a new CX_BIT_PATTERN object. * MA = Member Access Function * I = Indexable data field.
