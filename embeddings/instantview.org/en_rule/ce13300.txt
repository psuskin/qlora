This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_STRUCTURE - Structures (levels)" regarding Description: This class is used to organise business objects into structures (levels) or categories. These are hierarchical. To structure objects, a hierarchical structure is built using CX_STRUCTURE objects. The connection between the structure and the objects is established via the fixed data field "cast". Each CX_STRUCTURE object now points to the object that is included in the newly created structure. To categorise objects, they are hierarchically linked to each other via the fixed data field "structures". Each of these objects must be derived from CX_STRUCTURED for this purpose. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_STRUCTURE - Structures (levels)" regarding Code example: * MA = member access function, greyed out = inherited function * I = Indexable data field, greyed out = inherited data field.
