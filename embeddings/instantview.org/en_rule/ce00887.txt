This is the description of the class "Definition of leap year": A leap year includes 29 February as an additional day, so that the year consists of 366 days instead of 365. The rules that govern a leap year were established by Pope Gregory in 1582 for the so-called "Gregorian calendar", and are A leap year is smooth, i.e. without rest, divisible by "4" and not the last year of a century. For example, the year 1996 is a leap year, since "1996 / 4 = 499". "1997" on the other hand is not: "1997 / 4 = 499R1". The last year of a new century is not a leap year, unless it is divisible by "400". So the year "1900" ("1900 / 400 = 4R3") is not a leap year, but the year "2000" is ("2000 / 400 = 5").
