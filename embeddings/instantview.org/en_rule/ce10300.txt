This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_ACCESS - Communication" regarding Description:(Business Pattern): Accesses control the communication with real objects. This means that a connection is established via them. For example, a (street) address represents the connection to a person or a company. Each access is subordinated to one of the following areas: This class cannot be used by itself and has neither functions nor data fields. CX_ACCESS describes the real possibilities to connect to (essentially) CX_PARTNER objects. This includes, for example, addresses, telephone numbers, but also bank details. In the data field objects CX_ACCESS holds the relations to (among others) the CX_PARTNER objects, different CX_PARTNER objects can therefore have the same access (e.g. same address of two affiliated companies). The CX_PARTNER objects in turn have access to the reference list. The same CX_PARTNER object can have different access options: e.g. different addresses (further specified via CX_WRAPPER and slot addressTypeEnum), different telephone numbers and bank details. As CX_REAL_OBJECT (with the exception of CX_CURRENT_ACCOUNT::directDebiting) only CX_PARTNER objects have fixed access descriptions. Other CX_REAL-OBJECT objects such as CX_ITEM have only an indirect indication of their (storage) location via CX_STOCK. CX_ACCESS objects are also used by CX_CLEARING_OBJECT objects, such as CX_STOCK and CX_WORK_STATION.
