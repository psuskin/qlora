This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_OBJECT_DICTIONARY_ML" regarding Description: The class CX_OBJECT_DICTIONARY_ML makes it possible to register objects under any multilingual identifiers. An object can have any number of identifiers, and any number of objects can be entered in the Dictionary per identifier. Conceptually, a dictionary corresponds to a multimap. The objects can be retrieved very quickly by means of the names assigned to them. The dictionary also manages a back-reference, so that you can obtain all the names under which an object was entered. In the case of multilingual identifiers, it should be noted that they must be the same in all languages in order to be recognised as the same identifier. This plays a role in recognising duplicate entries in EnterML and in finding the identifier to be deleted in RemoveML. When searching in the dictionary, upper/lower case letters are distinguished (case sensitive). Methods that work in one language always refer to the currently active system language. (Enter, Query, Exists, Remove) CX_OBJECT_DICTIONARY_ML belongs to the family of object dictionary classes and is available as of Dll version 141847.
