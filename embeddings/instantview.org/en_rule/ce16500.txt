This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_COSTS - Costs" regarding Description: The following costs exist: All cost accounting entries, regardless of whether they are for cost centre, cost unit or project, will be financed by the cost element is identified as an expense, income or service type. The cost element corresponds (usually directly) to a profit and loss account of the Financial accounting. A cost element thus serves to classify costs; cost centres, Cost units, etc. serve only for allocation purposes. This allocation must be directly and can be subsequently changed or extended. Cost elements must (should) therefore always be (should be) associated with multi-dimensional transactions are accounted for, i.e.: CX_MULTIPLE_ACCOUNTS_TXN or CX_SPLIT_ACCOUNT_TXN Objects in which subBookings distribute the costs stands. The function Dimensions() returns as a vector the cost dimension of a If it is the booking itself, then the booking is not possible. dimension only the cost element account, it is a subordinate cost- If you make a booking, the dimension consists of cost element and cost centre. Cost-type accounting is the starting point of cost accounting. Its result is that the cost, revenue and performance information based on original receipts - as far as possible - the cost types, revenue types, cost centres and assigned to activity types and the direct costs with the cost units are connected. Costs (types of costs) that can be directly allocated to cost objects are called are referred to as direct costs, the others as overheads. Overhead costs can still be divided into variable and fixed costs. Overheads can therefore only be allocated to the place where they are incurred will be. Cost centre accounting is therefore based on cost element accounting, the result of which is is usually presented in the form of a BAB. In this, the above-mentioned direct costs is listed above the actual cost centre accounting. They are listed as Performance indicators for the determination of the material or production overheads cost rates were used. The tasks of the BAB are: - Allocate overhead costs to cost centres according to their source - Calculation of overheads per cost centre (ratio from direct costs to overheads) - Comparison of costs within and between cost centres The cost rates of a cost centre can be calculated according to the actual, normal or planned cost accounting can be determined. (Value of the variable costCenterCostingEnum) For cost centres/cost elements, accounts can be created via directly assigned Formula attributes e.g. percentage splitting into fixed and variable costs if such an apportionment cannot be made directly - or only can be achieved - with very great effort. actual cost accounting: The actual cost rate is calculated from total costs and employment at full cost. If a split of the cost rates (fixed-uncash, fixed-ash, variable), then the partial and marginal cost rates can also be calculated calculate (partial cost accounting). Marginal cost rates can be calculated with CX_PER_VALUE image. Standard (normal) cost accounting: Planned cost rates are recorded depending on full or partial cost accounting. The target costs are calculated from the planned cost rate multiplied by actual employment. If a plan employment is also recorded, the employment rate can be (fixed cost coverage) can be determined. planned cost calculation: Planned cost rates are also recorded subdivided according to cost types. Beyond that employment must be planned. Any cost structures, i.e. the basic allocation, which cost type for which cost centre is relevant, can be defined via force elements can be determined. Usually this allocation results directly from the structure of a BAB's, which is is also represented as a structural object, or is even identical to it. A classification into cost centre or cost location and their hierarchical Any structure is possible. A division into so-called auxiliary cost centres, pre-cost centres is also possible, end cost centres, etc. These structural divisions and their possible compactions are realised via structural elements. The activity linkage between the cost centres is thus independent of its organisational structure, but can also be based on it. Service interdependencies are also managed via CX_STRUCTURE objects and associated CX_ALLOCATION objects. Within cost centre accounting, overhead costs are divided into primary and secondary costs. Primary costs are costs that are incurred through external purchases. Secondary costs relate to services provided by entities in the can be purchased within the company. This distinction becomes important for Distribution of costs: 1. distribution of primary costs Initially, the (primary) overheads, which are only recorded by cost element, are distributed to the cost centres via activity variables. Performance is measured on the basis of a performance or reference variable, which is known as slot is listed in the account of the cost centre (besides costs, revenues, .). The actual performance of a cost centre can either be entered directly into a balance object can be written to the cost centre (manually or from a data transfer), or can also be booked directly (since it is defined as a slot in the account). It is also possible to have any number of different output sizes per cost centre can be defined. However, attention must then be paid to this, that cost centres defined in this way have specific formulas for calculating the actual costs and possible further charges. 2. allocation of secondary costs With hierarchical allocation of cost centres, you only need to ensure that the apportionment is "from bottom to top" (step ladder method). With mutual interlinking of the (auxiliary) cost centres the following results a linear system of equations that can be solved iteratively. In the first step, the original amount (total actual costs) is transferred to the cost centres distributed, in the following iteration steps only the Amount allocated that the cost center received in the previous step has. After only a few calculation steps (approx. 5-6) the sum of the undistributed Remainder of all cost centres so small that the iteration can be aborted. Cost elements can be distributed directly to cost centres via distribution structures distributed, even without fictitious cost centres ! The distribution of the costs can be dependent on cost elements or can be statistical cost element, etc. ! The distribution takes place via structures and linked allocation objects. The costing rates are formed at the end of cost centre accounting, by dividing the total cost of the cost centre by the value of the cost centre is divided. Depending on the cost accounting method (full cost, partial costing), this is applied to the total costs or only to the variable costs of the job. Cost unit accounting is used to determine the costs of the cost units. If they are calculated per unit, this is called unit costing. or costing, the costs of a cost unit are calculated for an period, this is referred to as cost unit time accounting. is designated. The costing process within the cost unit accounting takes place are as follows: Material costs incl. material overhead surcharges (bills of materials). + production costs incl. production overhead (routings) = manufacturing costs + administrative overhead surcharges + distribution overhead + administration/sales special direct costs = cost of goods sold The difference between the selling price and the cost price is the contribution margin. The cost unit time accounting (also known as operating profit or short-term income statement) sets the cost object unit accounting as as the main data supplier. A distinction is made between the total cost method and the cost-of-sales method and further broken down into actual, planned and normal costs. Cost unit time accounting is used for profit planning and profit control. It can refer to different cost units such as individual items, Article groups, individual customers, customer groups, sales areas, representatives, etc. obtain. As it is impossible to include all possible reports as standard evaluations special structure objects (OLPA objects) are used for these tasks are made available. In the case of the short-term income statement on a full cost basis, the Profit, in that the valuated changes in inventory are added to the period revenue semi-finished and finished products are added together and of which the total cost can be subtracted. In the cost-of-sales method based on marginal costs (contribution margin accounting). only the variable unit costs are deducted from the selling price. (DB I). The fixed costs are recorded according to cost types and globally deducted (DBII).
