This is the description of the class "CX_NUMERIC - Comparisons": The following overviews show the comparison operators and the operands with which a real number can be linked. All operators return the result of the comparison as a truth value. Equality Larger Smaller Equality CX_NUMERIC = INTEGER = INTEGER <-> 2 = 1 = 0 2 = 2 = 1 2 = 3 = 0 CX_NUMERIC = CX_NUMERIC = INTEGER <-> 2,5 = 1,5 = 0 2,5 = 2,5 = 1 2,5 = 3,5 = 0 CX_NUMERIC = CX_PERCENT = INTEGER <-> 2 = 1% = 0 2 = 2% = 1 2 = 3% = 0 CX_NUMERIC = CX_VALUE = INTEGER <-> 2 = 1 piece = 0 2 = 2 pieces = 1 2 = 3 pieces = 0 CX_NUMERIC = CX_FRACTION = INTEGER -> 2,5 = 3/4 = 0 2,5 = 5/2 = 1 2,5 = 7/2 = 0 CX_NUMERIC = CX_FORMULA = INTEGER -> 10 = Formula = Number Note: Before the comparison is carried out, the formula is evaluated. The actual comparison is only carried out if the result is an object that can be compared with a real number. If this is the case, the result is a number . CX_NUMERICC = CX_CONDITIONED_BAG = INTEGER -> 10 = conditional object table = Number Note: Before the comparison is performed, the corresponding object is determined from the conditional object table. The actual comparison is only performed if this object can be compared with a real number. If this is the case, the result is a number .
