This is the description of the class "CX_PERIODIC_SPAN_TIME - Arithmetic": The following overviews show the mathematical operators and the operands with which a periodic time span can be linked. Addition When adding a value to a periodic time period, this value is added to the start time . CX_PERIODIC_SPAN_TIME + CX_VALUE = CX_TIME -> 9.20 - 9.50 every 10 minutes + 5 minutes = 9.25 Subtraction When a value is subtracted from a periodic time period, this value is subtracted from the start time . CX_PERIODIC_SPAN_TIME - CX_VALUE = CX_TIME -> 9.20 - 9.50 every 10 minutes - 5 minutes = 9.15 If a time is subtracted from a periodic time period, the difference is always output in hundredths of a second. This refers to the start time of the period. CX_PERIODIC_SPAN_TIME - CX_TIME = CX_VALUE <-> 9.20 - 9.50 - 9.00 = 120000 s/100.
