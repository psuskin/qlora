This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_ENUM_ENTRY" regarding Description: This class represents an entry in the transformation table. CX_ENUM_ENTRY objects should not be created with CreateTransObject or CreatePersObject, but as result of the AddEntry method of the CX_ENUM_TABLE class. Important: If a CX_ENUM_ENTRY object has been created by CreateTransObject, it must not be linked(entries) into a CX_ENUM_TABLE . The CX_ENUM_TABLE automatically deletes all CX_ENUM_ENTRY objects contained in entries, so that the object would be deleted several times. The only way this is allowed is to create the CX_ENUM_ENTRY object using CreateTransObject(,KEEP) and then link(entries) it to the CX_ENUM_TABLE . The CX_ENUM_ENTRY object created in this way may only be linked to a maximum of one CX_ENUM_TABLE . This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_ENUM_ENTRY" regarding Code example: * MA = Member Access Function * I = Indexable data field.
