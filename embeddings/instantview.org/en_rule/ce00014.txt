This is the description of the functionality of the class "Dynamic access to location data" regarding Description: In the following, the functions that can be used to access the location-specific data from InstantViewÂ® are presented. All functions are those that are called for a specific locale without any further parameters. This is the description of the functionality of the class "Dynamic access to location data" regarding Further: The functions marked with an (*) generate an error message if the desired information is not available. For example, if a country locale is loaded, the name of a region or state cannot be displayed because you are at the state level. In addition, some functions are still available, especially in connection with the date classes. These can also be called directly for a certain date, whereby they then refer to the currently set locale. However, if you want to work with several locales in an application, it makes sense that these functions are also available for one locale. A conceivable example application would be a calendar that shows for different federal states whether the current one is a public holiday and if so, what it is called.
