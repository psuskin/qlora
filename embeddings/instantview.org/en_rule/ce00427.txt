This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_CONDITIONED_BAG - Conditional object tables" regarding Description: This class manages "If.then" relationships in a table. A table entry consists of a condition ("If") and an object assigned to it ("Then"). An entry is managed with a formula condition. When the table is evaluated, the object whose assigned condition is fulfilled is delivered. I.e. in this case the table behaves like a kind of switch . Example: In the example, a price table containing special customer discounts is shown. Here, the customer "Meier" receives a special discount of "6%" for order quantities of less than 50 units. If, on the other hand, the customer "MÃ¼ller" orders a quantity of 25 units, "5%" is returned as a discount. It should also be noted that the individual entries can also deliver different objects. For example, if the order quantity is between 50 and 100, a unit price of "49.89 DM" is agreed, so that the returned object is not a percentage, but a value . This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_CONDITIONED_BAG - Conditional object tables" regarding Code example: Note: Instead of an entry, a vector of entries can be passed to the table for insertion. Display on screen An object box provides the functionality to display the individual entries of a conditional object table. An example display is shown in the following graphic (programme code and further notes): In this example, the column division options have been used to make the display clearer. * MA = member access function I = Indexable data field.
