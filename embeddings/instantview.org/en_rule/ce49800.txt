This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_WORD_XML" regarding Description: Objects of this class represent Word documents and support the operations relevant for printing. Since the objects of this class work on an internal structure, working with the objects is more performant than working with OLE objects. The class CX_OLE_WORD_XML offers corresponding functions to convert an OLE object into an XML object and with AsCOM the XML object can be converted back into a CX_COM_OBJECT. Alternatively, the XML objects can be saved in a *.xml file via WriteToFile and opened with Word. Both functions use the transient range for this. So you do not have to call SaveXMLString to see the latest changes in the result. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_WORD_XML" regarding Code example: * MA = Member Access Function * I = Indexable data field.
