This is the description of the class "CX_ACTION_LIST - Action list": 230295. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_ACTION_LIST - Action list" regarding Description: Objects of the type CX_ACTION_LIST represent the action list of a module or widget. The action list is obtained via the methods: CX_MODULE::GetActionList and CX_WIDGET::GetActionList. Attention: The event overriding during the widget import does not represent an action list in the classical sense. GetActionList on an Import() widget (in the importing module) returns the "action list" with the overridden messages for the imported main widget (but not the child elements). The overwritten messages of the imported child elements cannot be accessed via CX_ACTION_LIST at the moment. This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_ACTION_LIST - Action list" regarding Code example: (INITIALIZE) FALSE Module Call(GetActionList) Call(GetSourceRanges) iterate { FALSE Swap Call(Read) } * MA = Member Access Function, greyed out = inherited function * I = Indexable data field, greyed out = inherited data field.
