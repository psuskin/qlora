This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_GLOBAL_DATETIME - Global time" regarding Description: A global time represents the combination of a date and a time specification, whereby the possible types from both classes can be mixed as desired. In the simplest case, a current date is combined with a time . When generating the time point, it is "empty", i.e. it does not contain any information about a time or a date. In addition, a global time contains two time zone specifications, which can be used to answer questions such as the time difference between two dates, which frequently occurs in aviation, for example. If time 1 represents "7 March 2018 at 8.00 a.m. in time zone 1h" and time 2 represents "7 March 2018 at 12.00 a.m. in time zone 2h", their difference(time 2 - time 1) is "3 hours". Conversely, the question of a "target time" can also arise. If, for example, the departure date of an aircraft is "25 October 2018 at 8.00 a.m. in time zone 1h" and only the time zone of the destination ("11h") and the flight time ("36 hours") are known, the global time of arrival can be calculated. Therefore a global time can manage a "destination" time zone in addition to the "start" time zone. Examples:.
