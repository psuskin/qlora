This is the description of the class "Special data types": The special data types are used to describe objects that actually belong to the elementary data types, since they are used as such in everyday life. For example, a current date, such as "Monday, 27.1.1997", or a formula, such as "total price = quantity * 4.59 DM - 10%", represents an everyday quantity, which is not available as a data type in EDP by default. In ClassiXÂ® , these object types are summarised as special data types and are subdivided into areas: Area Examples Date "27.1.1997", "From 22.1.1997 to 27.1.1997", "1st calendar week 1997", "Sundays and public holidays Time "10.00", "From 10.00 to 11.00", "From 10 to 11 every 20 minutes Date "On 25 March 1997 at 10 a.m.", "On 1.1.1997 at 1 a.m. in time zone 1h" Number "2", "2.5", "20%", "4.59 DM", "1/2" Formulas "Price = quantity * DM 4.59 - 10%". conditional object tables If the customer is "Meier" and the article is "tin can type 5", then 5% discount, otherwise 3% discount Each of these data types accesses country-specific information. For example, a date in the European area is usually displayed in the format "DD.MM.YYYY", while in the USA the preferred spelling is "MM/DD/YYYY". All this country-specific information is managed in so-called locales and can be adapted as required.
