This is the description of the functionality of the class "CX_PERIODIC_DATE - Periodic date" regarding Display on screen: In contrast to classes such as CX_DATE , a periodic date does not have its own interface object. Instead, the user can design an input mask adapted for his purposes, the contents of which are placed in the object via the available access functions. As an example, an input mask for entering (any) weekday combinations is shown below. Using the radio buttons, the user can generate a periodic date, such as "Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays" in the figure (see also programme code). If "standard periods" are often used, such as "From Monday to Friday" or "On weekends", the recording can be further simplified by using other input fields, as shown in the following figure (programme code). * MA = Member Access Function.
