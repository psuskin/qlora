This is the description of the class "X_Index file": An index file is a tool to speed up access to certain data records in large files. In a data file it is usually only possible to search sequentially, i.e. records are read in one after another until the desired one is found. On average this means "number of records in the file / 2" read accesses to the data file. When an index file is created, however, the position of a record in its file is assigned to the record itself. For this purpose, a key is defined, which can consist of any number of key fields , by which each record can be uniquely identified, i.e. no two records may have the same key . When searching for a record, the exact position in the file is calculated from the transferred key and a corresponding entry in the index file, so that in addition to a small number of accesses to the index file (usually only one), only one read access to the data file takes place. When an index file is created, it is given the name of the data file, only the extension ".idx".
