This is the description of the class "CET": A time zone defines the difference of the local time from Central European Time (CET) in minutes.Usually, this difference is expressed in hours. This results in 24 time zones (from -12 to +11 hours), whereby the CET area has a deviation of "0 hours". However, since there are regions and countries that define their own time zones deviating from this (e.g. Afghanistan has a deviation of 3 hours and 26 minutes), ClassiXÂ® specifies it in minutes (in this case it is 206 minutes).The value range is -720 to +719 minutes.Note: Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) has the time zone "-1 hour". This may seem strange, as it is defined as world time .
