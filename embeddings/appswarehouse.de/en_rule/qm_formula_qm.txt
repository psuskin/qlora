This is the description of the module "qm_formula_qm" with the name "Formula Object (CX_FORMULA)": This is used to check the formula calculation for transient/persistent objects for correct function. At the bottom of the window there are two buttons. The button 'Test' lets you run through some formulas quickly one after the other and compares the calculated results with the expected values. The button 'Random Test' lets you endlessly run through a few randomly selected formulas and compares the values. The three text fields show the formula to be calculated at the top, the internal formula format in the middle and the calculated result at the bottom. Under the menu item 'Test', 'Test Export' defines some formula examples with which the multilingual capability can be tested. If one selects an example here and then activates another language with the menu 'Language', units etc. should also change the language. With button 'start', formulas are evaluated and the result is checked. To prove not only the correctnes of formula evaluation but also the stability of the algorithms involved, formulas are evaluated in random order. Menu 'Test Export' shows the representation of formulas with language dependent terms, i.e. enumeration constants and constant with dimensions like 'pieces'.
