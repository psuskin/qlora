This is the description of the module "logcyuse" with the name "System login by selecting a client and a user": Within this processing stage, you determine the client you want to work with and you register in the system as an additional user. When a user logs on, the system checks whether a separate company calendar (locale) exists at the employing company (place of employment of the employee). If so, this locale is logged on, otherwise it is checked whether the locale has one and so on up to the top locale. If no operating calendar was found in this way, the system checks whether there is a locale at the client's company and registers it. If no locale is linked here either, the locale specified in the batch file is registered via the environment variables for country, state and region. This is the description of the functionality of the module "logcyuse" with the name "System login by selecting a client and a user" regarding Client change window: This window is used to change clients quickly, it remains open after pressing the OK button so that several changes can be made quickly one after the other (entry of financial accounting documents). The successful change of client can be recognised by the title of the main window.
