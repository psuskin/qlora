This is the description of the module "solutions_vulcan" with the name "VULCAN - Variant management": With sustainable variant management, you master and shape the diversity of your service spectrum far beyond pure product configuration.Sustainable variant management provides the topicsDetectionPlanning andUseof variants into the foreground, following exactly this order.VULCAN provides you with all the tools you need for sustainable variant management. VULCAN contains a part variance analyser for the detection of variants , a series of apps for part specification for the design and management of the variance and a product configurator for the subsequent use of this variance in VULCAN. This is the description of the functionality of the module "solutions_vulcan" with the name "VULCAN - Variant management" regarding Parts variance analyser: App to find "similar" parts in the part master, i.e. to find and structure groups of parts in such a way that the individual members of a group can only be uniquely described by different characteristics of one and the same feature bar. The attribute scale itself is determined by the group and is therefore valid for all members (parts) of the group. This is the description of the functionality of the module "solutions_vulcan" with the name "VULCAN - Variant management" regarding Product configurator: The aim of a product configuration is to create a sales bill of materials consisting of assembly sets, sales sets or loose sales items. The advantages of VULCAN lie in the conditional positions of the assemblies and sales sets, which are automatically pronounced after the query of material characteristics. The sales parts list of a product configuration can also be freely composed from individual components of the article master. Through a connection to AutoCAD, a product configuration can also be created by importing a CAD drawing. An import from an MS Excel file is also possible.
