This is the description of the module "purogedt" with the name "Order group": Order items can be combined into price groups. This is done automatically by the system when using order sets, but can also be done manually in the order. You can put together groups from different items in the order. Each item can only be used in one group. A price is defined for the group and the price for the sub-items is adjusted proportionally so that the sum of these is equal to the group price. If all items are removed from a group, the group is also deleted.
