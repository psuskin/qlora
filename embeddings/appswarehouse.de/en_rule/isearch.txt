This is the description of the module "isearch" with the name "Search for parts": Keywords are entered into the search field, which searches out the matching parts from a dictionary, which you have to imagine as a telephone book, and displays them in the list. Any number of these keywords can be defined for each part. In this way you can determine with which keywords this part is found in the search. This can be, for example, the designation or the article number. The search is inaccurate by default. This means that if only the first part of a word is entered, the system will search for data beginning with that part of the word. In addition, the machine allows the user to work with wildcards. If the entered search term starts with an asterisk followed by a word, the system searches all data that has this entered word anywhere in the search term. The question mark stands for exactly one or no character, which is unknown, or none, in contrast to the asterisk, where it does not matter how many characters follow or precede. The question mark can therefore be placed anywhere in the word. Examples of this: Search Keyword returns all data whose search term screws* start with screws *screws Screws contains screws*wrench start with screws and include spanner Me?er is 5 letters long, the first two "Me", the last two "he" and the 3rd letter is unknown, or the search term sea. This is the description of the functionality of the module "isearch" with the name "Search for parts" regarding Classification: Parts offer yet another way to be found quickly in the list. Parts can be assigned to classification terms, e.g. the part type. All parts which are assigned to a certain part type are shown in the list if this part type has been selected by the button Part type. The first column of the list shows a parts symbol. This parts symbol can have three colours: On the right hand side next to the table all the rolls of the part are displayed. Related topics.
