This is the description of the module "cxWorkTimeModel" with the name "Working time model": Working time models can be created and assigned for employees and cost centres. Events are used to define working times within a working time model. They are used to specify, for example, when the working day begins and ends and when or how long the breaks are. There are two different ways of specifying the target working time:The events "AZT start" and "AZT start" preset in the standard are stored in the model with their respective time as "normal" working time. If breaks (PAU) are also specified during this time, they are also stored in the model with their respective start and end times. The difference between the "AZT start" and "AZT start" times and the deduction of the break times then automatically results in the target working time.With the event "working day" preset in the standard, the target working time is specified directly.In a working time model, it is usually also specified from when to when, e.g. the operating time (BZT) or the core time (KZT) is. On the basis of this data, the system can check when which time message (punch time) was sent by whom within or outside of these predefined frame times.Through these working time models defined in this way, the capacity of the employee can be automatically determined and saved in capacity planning for a defined period of time. The system then recognises, for example, that the employee works 8 hours on Mondays and Tuesdays, but only 7 hours on Fridays.In order for capacity planning to take these working times into account, the employee must be assigned to a time rule that refers to the "capacity planning rule". This is indicated on the time rule or directly on the employee if the employee does not clock in and the working time model is only to be used for his capacity planning.
