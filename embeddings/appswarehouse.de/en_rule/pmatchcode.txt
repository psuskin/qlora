This is the description of the module "pmatchcode" with the name "Search terms with partners": Search terms allow you to find companies and persons quickly, but are also used for parts, etc. Several search terms can be created simultaneously for a company/person. These search terms are stored in a dictionary, which you can think of as a telephone book. In contrast to the use for parts/articles, search terms for companies and persons are only defined in one language. At least the name should always be entered as a search term, which - as a rule - is the same in all languages. All other search terms can be freely assigned, they are not limited in number. Basically there are two ways of saving the search terms. If the search term is saved for the company/person (default), this search term is used to find the company in all its roles . If the search term was created for the role, the company can only be found for the role for which the search term was saved. Example for the explicit saving of search terms only for the role: The search term "Monitormüller" was created only for the role "Customer" of the company Müller. At the same time, the Müller company also has a supplier role. Now the company Müller can only be found in the company search and the customer search with the search term "Monitormüller". If you search for Monitormüller under suppliers, this company will not be found. Please note the following when displaying the search terms: Search terms saved for the companies are displayed in blue in the search term field. Search terms saved for the role are shown in red in the search term field. Related topics General search terms.
