This is the description of the module "listen" with the name "Evaluation - Lists": Lists are usually fixed lists of similar elements, such as all movements on a financial accounting account, all unpaid invoices, etc. These can then usually be limited by selection criteria (accounts from - to, calendar week, supplier name, etc.). These can then usually be narrowed down using selection criteria (accounts from - to, calendar week, supplier names, etc.). In the lists, you can determine and change the sort order yourself, adjust column widths or even hide columns. To change the sorting order, use the 'Ctrl' key simultaneously with the left mouse button. With each click, the sorting mode then changes between the states 'Down', 'Up' and 'Off'. You determine the first sorting column by clicking on the desired column. Without using the 'Ctrl'-key, all previously selected criteria are disabled. If you want to sort by other keys, press the 'Ctrl' key and click on the next desired column. This then receives a symbol with two arrows, the next one one with three arrows, etc. To change the column width or to hide the column completely, drag the mouse pointer to the relevant space and press the left mouse button. Then keep it pressed and drag the mouse to the left or right accordingly. Release the mouse button when the column has the desired width. A double-click in the space otherwise adjusts the column width to the column content. You can of course also print the lists displayed on the screen. Most lists also have a button for outputting the entire list to a file for further processing in Excel, for example. Also note that lists often extend beyond the area displayed on the screen. You must then 'scroll' accordingly with the mouse. If you want to print such extra-wide lists, it is advisable to check whether your printer settings are set to landscape format.By adjusting the DPI settings, the data can be displayed larger.
