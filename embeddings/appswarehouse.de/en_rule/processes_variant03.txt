This is the description of the module "processes_variant03" with the name "Variant documents": Variant documents serve as templates for document references just like "normal" documents. The only difference is that when referencing, the attributes are transferred directly into the document reference and can therefore be edited further here as well. For normal documents, only the attributes of the master document can be maintained and are then valid for all associated document references. Maintenance of the attributes is terminated here by an error message. Related topics: List of documents Attributes.
