This is the description of the module "spardire" with the name "Spare parts list": When a complex system is delivered, a spare parts list makes it possible to provide the customer immediately with a spare parts list with unique spare parts numbers which he can refer to in the event of damage. All parts of an order for which the indicator "Spare part" has been set in the part master, the indicator "Spare parts list" in the master parts list or the indicator "Spare parts list" in the production parts list are automatically transferred to the spare parts list. Since a lot of work is also done with variant parts, it can be difficult to agree with the customer which part he needs exactly in which specification. To simplify this, ClassiX offers the possibility to create so-called specifications on the spare part rolls of the variant parts, which describe the attributes. This way, for each variant part version a unique spare part number is created, which enables the customer to describe easily and exactly which part is concerned in the system. If a variant part has several spare part roles, the desired role must be assigned via the context menu on the list. The new E-number can then be assigned via the context menu.
