This is the description of the functionality of the module "multiLingual" with the name "Multilingualism" regarding Introduction: In a globalised economy one is constantly confronted with foreign languages and foreign currencies. In this section we will look at foreign languages and describe how multilingualism is handled in the CyberEnterprise business OS. But first, some definitions of terms: CyberEnterprise business OS basically distinguishes between an operating language and a document language. The operating language is the language in which the screen masks are displayed and the machine is operated. It is possible to change the operating language during operation. This is done via the buttons with the country flags ( ): All language-dependent elements (menu labelling, buttons etc.) automatically adapt to the selected language. German and English are implemented as operating languages by default. Further languages can be added as required using the Text Literal Browsers for system messages and user texts. The document language is the language in which texts are entered and output. In principle, the document language is independent of the operating language, i.e. with an operating language set to "German", i.e. with a "German" user interface, it is possible, for example, to enter an offer with English texts. This is the description of the functionality of the module "multiLingual" with the name "Multilingualism" regarding Multilingual user interface: Texts for graphical user interface (GUI) elements can be created in source code within the CyberEnterprise business OS. You can find more information on this under: Technical documentation (AppsWH) Multilingualism in texts.
