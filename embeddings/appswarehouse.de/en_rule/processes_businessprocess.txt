This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_businessprocess" with the name "Business processes" regarding What is a business process?: A business process describes the sequence of recurring tasks that can occur in a company. A process usually consists of several statuses and transitions between one status and another. A status within a business process describes a state in which a work can be. The transition indicates the conditions or prerequisites under which a change from one state to the next takes place. It is also possible that the change is dependent on another process, i.e. the transition only takes place when another business process has reached a certain status. Therefore, it is also possible to link business processes with each other.
