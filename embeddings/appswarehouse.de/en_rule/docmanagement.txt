This is the description of the module "docmanagement" with the name "ClassiX® Document Management": In all ClassiX® applications you also have access to a comprehensive document management. You can not only create all your correspondence and documents, but also design them flexibly and according to your needs. In addition, all documents are automatically managed in a transaction-related manner. Thus ClassiX® implements an electronic document management, in which you can find individual documents at any time directly via your business transactions or document history. Generally, your business documents are composed of several elements (document modules): Header first page (e.g. company logo, business address), salutation, footer first page, etc. You then compile a specific document from the predefined modules. You can enter the individual modules directly as text in the 'Document Module' window, but you can also create them in your standard word processor, such as Microsoft Word. The modules can in turn have a modular structure. By using 'fields', values can be taken directly from ClassiX®. In this way you can, for example, create form letters and reminder runs automatically. This is the description of the functionality of the module "docmanagement" with the name "ClassiX® Document Management" regarding Text modules: Text modules enable the central administration of document templates. Here, as with the document modules, information from ClassiX® is directly used with the help of the fields. Standard modules can be pre-selected for the different purposes, which ClassiX® then uses automatically at the appropriate places. For example, to see the settings for letter, fax and e-mail as they are later used in the transaction documents, via the document settings of the client.
