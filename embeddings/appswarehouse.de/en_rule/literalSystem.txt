This is the description of the module "literalSystem" with the name "Text Literals": This module is part of the multilingualism of theCyberEnterprise® platform and is responsible for the system texts in the different operating languages. With this module the texts occurring as text constants on the CyberEnterprise® platform can a) be displayed, b) be specifically adapted to the company and/or c) be translated into all other desired languages.By default, all texts on the CyberEnterprise platform are recorded in German as the first language and English as the second language. In contrast to the text literals of the AppsWarehouse modules, the text literals of the CyberEnterprise platform have their own unique identification number via which these texts can be maintained. Using this number, the texts can be changed (for alternative designations: e.g. January - January) and/or freely assigned to a language from the third language onwards. This is the description of the functionality of the module "literalSystem" with the name "Text Literals" regarding List window: This window is used to list all text literals that occur as text constants on the CyberEnterprise® platform. The loading/listing takes place directly after calling up this module. The texts of a text literal itself are maintained by double-clicking in the editing window. In the first column of the list the identifying system number is displayed, then the texts in the respective languages, the type of text (unit, currency, error message, other), whereby texts of the type unit or currency can only be adapted via the module for the maintenance of units (some of these units (e.g. currencies) cannot be changed there either) and finally an indication of the changeability of the texts. This is the description of the functionality of the module "literalSystem" with the name "Text Literals" regarding Editing window: This window is used to maintain the text literals on the CyberEnterprise platform. The languages German and English are predefined in the standard. If text literals are changed (as alternative names) or languages are added, these text constants are stored in the file with the name customStrings.stg in the system directory (this usually corresponds to the directory CX_SYSTEM). This is the description of the functionality of the module "literalSystem" with the name "Text Literals" regarding Text Literal Translations: CyberEnterprise: With this app, languages other than German (first language) and English (bridge language) can be assigned to the (previously selected) text constants. In the delivered standard, translation is supported by means of DeepL (separate licence required).
