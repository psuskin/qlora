This is the description of the module "processes_changemanag" with the name "Change Management": There are basically two approaches to change management: Changes to a running production or before (description on this page) Modifications of already manufactured, stored parts according to customer requirements --> conversion parts lists In addition to a regulated and orderly re-entry of master and transaction data, procedures are required to change this data. The problem here is that such changes are always only permitted or possible with regard to the processing status and/or scope of use of the data to be changed. On the one hand, transaction data is itself subject to a business process, on the other hand, its status depends on the type and status of any subsequent documents. A change to a document must therefore first be checked with regard to previously necessary adjustments to the subsequent documents: if, for example, an order item contains a purchased part for which an order already exists, then a change to the date or quantity is only possible if the order has been adjusted beforehand or a further order has been triggered. In general, the following rule applies to changes - of documents linked in relation to predecessors/successors: the last document in a document chain should be the first to be changed, then you should navigate to the preceding document to make the change there - and so on Overview of known change scenarios Amendment necessary in: Order item Production bill of materials item Parts requirement item Production order item Order item (see also order processing) Action In process Approval for distribution Technical release Change quantity possible at any time possible at any time purchased part - not possible Stock section Production part - not possible Change part possible at any time possible at any time purchased part - not possible Stock section Production part - not possible Delete part possible at any time possible at any time Not possible as soon as a follow-up document is available ! Add part possible at any time possible at any time Purchase section Stock section Production part Change date (provision date, delivery date, technical release date) possible at any time possible at any time Purchase part - further into the future always possible. Closer to the current date only if the date on the BA is also premature. Stock part - always possible Production part - further into the future always possible. Closer to the current date only if the date of the request for a part is also premature.
