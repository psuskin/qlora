This is the description of the module "glacbals" with the name "Summary and balance list of G/L accounts": This module is used to call up the totals and balances list. The debit and credit values are displayed for the selected posting period (the so-called period values), cumulated from the beginning of the fiscal year belonging to the posting period up to the specified accrual period or optionally up to the end of the corresponding fiscal year. Totals of debit, credit and balance values are output across all accounts and additionally separated into balance sheet and profit and loss accounts. A further option enables the additional output of cost elements posted to a profit and loss account. A difference line is displayed in red if the total of these cost element postings does not match the total costs posted to the P&L account (Find cost element differences). If this option for displaying the cost elements is selected, you can also determine whether the profit and loss account belonging to the cost elements should be displayed at all. A double click on a list entry navigates - if period values exist - directly to a list of postings, otherwise to an overview of the period balances of the selected fiscal year. By using the right mouse button you always reach the overview of the period balances of the selected account in the selected fiscal year.
