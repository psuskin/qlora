This is the description of the module "machine" with the name "Machine": Machines are treated in the ClassiX® system as a special manifestation of parts, i.e. according to the linguistic usage of object orientation, one also says that machines are derived from parts, machines are inherited from parts.

In operation, they can have standard set-up and piece times, they require tools and have a direct connection to the plant master. For preventive maintenance, work plans can be assigned to the machines as maintenance plans. Based on these maintenance plans, maintenance orders (in the form of production orders) are created. All work created for a maintenance plan is recorded in the maintenance account of the machine. By means of the start date, the periodicity and the last work carried out, the system can then automatically determine in the maintenance module which maintenance orders are due next.
