This is the description of the module "processes_customerauditing" with the name "Customer creditworthiness": Customer creditworthiness is a synonym for the creditworthiness of the customer. This is made measurable by means of various key performance indicators (KPI) and can thus also be compared with other customers. In ClassiX, customer creditworthiness is realised via a KPI Auditor. This auditor automatically monitors the invoices/credit notes in the background and defines the key figures. It also provides an overview of the customer's rating. The detailed rating of an individual customer can be viewed via the KPI Monitor. The outgoing invoices are evaluated to determine the customer's creditworthiness. This is also carried out on the basis of the open items belonging to the invoice. If open items are posted directly in the financial accounting, they are not included in the customer creditworthiness. Outgoing credit notes are also taken into account for the determination of turnover. This is the description of the functionality of the module "processes_customerauditing" with the name "Customer creditworthiness" regarding Example of a customer credit rating: The system by which the customer's creditworthiness is assessed is not specified by ClassiX, but can be defined individually. The following rule for the rating is therefore only an example. In determining customer creditworthiness, firstly, weighted key figures are calculated in percentage points. The sum of the percentage points can add up to a maximum of 100, so a customer with a value of 100 is a customer with a very good credit rating. In addition, there are also summarised key figures, which result directly from the invoice/credit note.
