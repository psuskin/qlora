This is the description of the module "qm_garbage_qm" with the name "Garbage collection of transient objects": This test creates a transient object and then calls a function that produces stack data. Depending on which button was pressed, the function runs through up to 100,000 times. After the run, the 'Check' button can be used to check if the object is still present. If there is no error message, the object is still present and has not been erroneously removed from the garbage collection.
