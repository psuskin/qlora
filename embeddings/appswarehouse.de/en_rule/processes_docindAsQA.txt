This is the description of the module "processes_docindAsQA" with the name "Documents as QS report": Due to the functionality of the document directories, the attributes and the OLE interface, you can easily create and print QA inspection reports and protocols from ClassiX®. How this works is briefly explained on this page. The first step is to create a document directory object which will later serve as a test report. For this purpose, all information that belongs in the report should be created in the form of attributes. Next, the document directory becomes a variant document directory by setting the corresponding checkbox. The effect is that when the directory is referenced, the attributes are written to the document reference and can therefore be overwritten. For further processing, the QS report can be attached to a part if it is to apply specifically to one or a certain number of parts. When creating a quality assurance document, one can then use the menu "Insert -> Document directory reference -> Select document directory from part" when inserting. General inspection reports can also be selected via the selection window. If the inspector has now inserted a quality assurance report (as a document directory reference) in the QA position and has marked the attributes, only the last step is missing, the printing. A Word document can be used for this purpose, which should be saved in the database. The advantage over storing the document in a server directory is that the OLE User Box can display a preview of the print with filled document variables. The document variables just mentioned serve as interface from ClassiX® to Word. Thus, a complex test report can be created via Word and filled with information at runtime/when printing. (Your administrator or the ClassiX® supportwill be glad to help you with the creation of the document variables ).
