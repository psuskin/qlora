This is the description of the module "qs-purchaseinvoice" with the name "Inspection - Incoming invoice": Release check Account assignment. This is the description of the functionality of the module "qs-purchaseinvoice" with the name "Inspection - Incoming invoice" regarding Release check: Since an incoming invoice should not be released if the goods to be inspected have not yet passed through quality assurance, the QS quantities are taken into account in the release process. Test suites are required in this area, as the QS flag can be set not only on the part but also on various documents. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the entire order/invoice quantity passes through QS. % No data is written away during the tests. Instead, the test is aborted with a comment if an error has occurred. This is the description of the functionality of the module "qs-purchaseinvoice" with the name "Inspection - Incoming invoice" regarding Account assignment: Currently, "normal" incoming invoice items are recorded in a 1:1 relationship with the delivery schedule lines of the order. However, since these can have several cost object items (order items/stock order items) as predecessors, the proportion of cost objects in the incoming invoice item must be determined when the incoming invoice is entered. (The same applies to the cost centres). This division is written to the requested.containers . An automatic check (colouring of the cells) cannot be carried out because the order of the containers (requested.container) in the collection is determined randomly.
