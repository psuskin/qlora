This is the description of the module "qm_telephony_qm" with the name "Phone Manager Test": For testing: In the upper part all available devices are displayed. Make a call: Select the desired device, enter the phone number (as you want it dialled) and press Return or the button. Waiting for calls: Select the desired device and press the "Start Watch" button. Incoming calls are signalled by a message box. Perform actions with the call: Select the call from the list below. Using the buttons to the right of it, various actions can now be performed, depending on the status. A call that changes to the status PC_INVALID is automatically deleted from the list in this test module. Listening on one line for new calls and dialling on the same device is possible if the device supports it. To simulate hardware, an emulator can also be used, which can be found in \\admin3\d\arch\dev\tapi\ms\esp32.zip (Installation: The .TSP after c:\windows\system and register it in the Control Panel/telephone. A restart is not necessary. Before starting the ClassiX application the emulator has to be start, otherwise it is not available as a device).
