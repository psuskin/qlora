This is the description of the module "paydtazv" with the name "Posting payments abroad (accounts payable)": With this module, the open items selected from a payment proposal list are released for payment by creating a financial accounting payment document and (optionally) immediately afterwards the bank creates data carriers in the German data exchange format DTAZV for foreign payments. The creation of the bank data medium in the German data exchange format DTAUS can also be called up/repeated separately for a payment run (payment document of the financial accounting).

This is the description of the functionality of the module "paydtazv" with the name "Posting payments abroad (accounts payable)" regarding Create bank data medium DTAZV: From this window, a bank data medium can be created for a payment document in financial accounting. To do this, enter the document number of the payment run (to be repeated) and the corresponding period. In the repeat run, you have the option of subsequently excluding payments by selection. Since the payments are already posted at this point, this should only be done in exceptional cases. You therefore require special access rights to this function and must then remember to maintain the excluded payments for accounting purposes.
