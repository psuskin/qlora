This is the description of the module "ctacbstr" with the name "Evaluation of cost elements": If cost elements of cost accounting are structured by means of classification keys (below structure trees of the type "P&L", "BWA" or "TAS"), business management evaluations (BWA) can be created using this module. Analogous to this module, there is the account evaluation for G/L accounts in financial accounting. For each structure main and sub node, the current costs of the selected posting period (period costs) and the cumulative costs from the beginning of the fiscal year belonging to the posting period up to the specified accrual period - or optionally up to the end of the corresponding fiscal year - are displayed. A period range can also be specified as the current posting period, e.g. to make a quarterly evaluation. Optionally, the cost element accounts organised in a structure node can be issued additionally with the corresponding costs. If several company codes are assigned to a client, the cost element evaluation can be called up for individual company codes or cumulatively for several company codes simultaneously. This is the description of the functionality of the module "ctacbstr" with the name "Evaluation of cost elements" regarding Functionality: The left part of the window shows the selected structure. Depending on how far this tree is expanded, the costs are displayed in the right part of the window. Optionally, you can set whether you also want the accounts organised in a node to be expanded and thus listed in the right part.
