This is the description of the module "workTimeCloseMonth" with the name "Flexitime monthly statement": In the daily closing of working times, the individual come/go messages are offset against the break times. This results in the daily working times, which must, however, be adjusted from time to time, e.g. if someone forgets to log on or off at a time recording terminal.Daily closings can therefore be triggered again and again. At some point, however, you want to record the hours worked by an employee in a period, e.g. in order to pay out any overtime.The month-end closing stands for such a fixing of working times, i.e. a day-end closing can then no longer be carried out for a day of a closed month.If a maximum monthly carry-forward balance is defined in the system, the working time balance is corrected accordingly.After a month-end closing, the relevant working time bookings can only be viewed in the month cube.If the last month of a year is closed, only then will the closing balance of this month be transferred to the first month of the following year as the opening balance.The monthly closing cannot/will not be executed if one of the following conditions applies:the employee is also a time sheet clerk and the last daily closing is still before the last day of the month to be closedthe last absenteeism accounting is still before the last day of the month to be closed.
