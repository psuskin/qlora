This is the description of the module "paychequ" with the name "Payments Posting Cheque (Accounts Payable)": With this module, the open items selected from a payment proposal list are released for payment by creating a financial accounting payment document and (optionally) the cheques are printed immediately afterwards. The printing of cheques can also be called up/repeated separately for a payment run (payment document from financial accounting) at a later date. This is the description of the functionality of the module "paychequ" with the name "Payments Posting Cheque (Accounts Payable)" regarding Book payments/print cheques: From this window, the open items selected in the payment proposal list are released for payment by check. This is the description of the functionality of the module "paychequ" with the name "Payments Posting Cheque (Accounts Payable)" regarding Printing cheques: From this window, the printing of checks can be triggered from the data of a payment document in financial accounting. To do this, enter the document number of the payment run (to be repeated) and the corresponding period. In the repeat run, you have the option of subsequently excluding payments by selection. Since the payments are already posted at this point, this should only be done in exceptional cases. You therefore require special access rights to this function and must then remember to maintain the excluded payments for accounting purposes.
