This is the description of the functionality of the module "payevdnc" with the name "Proof of payments (creditors)" regarding Functionality: From this window, a bank data medium can be created for a payment document in financial accounting. To do this, enter the document number of the payment run (to be repeated) and the corresponding period. In the repeat run, you have the option of subsequently excluding payments by selection. Since the payments are already posted at this point, this should only be done in exceptional cases. You therefore require special access rights to this function and must then remember to maintain the excluded payments for accounting purposes.
