Calling up the list searches for the order items which have the status "delivered" or "partially delivered" and are in parallel "not invoiced" or "partially invoiced". In addition there must be an open quantity to be invoiced. (Delivered quantity - invoiced quantities = open quantity) If all order items are displayed, they are automatically sorted and displayed to the customer. The items which are not to be invoiced can now be removed from the list. If a customer is selected and removed, all his items are removed from the list. If the list is complete, invoices can be created automatically on the basis of the items. Various options are available for this.
