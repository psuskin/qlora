This is the description of the module "processes_versioning" with the name "Version security": Individual adaptations to so-called standard programs inevitably lead to a decoupling from new versions or release statuses of the software. Not so with ClassiX速. This is because the ClassiX速 system was also developed with a view to the greatest possible individualisation, while retaining the possibility of upgrading the programme modules supplied as standard. In general, the ClassiX速 system is characterised by the fact that the applications supplied as standard are controlled by data and/or rules stored in the database. This already provides a high degree of flexibility, but changes to the program code are often unavoidable. Such modifications and/or extensions are possible in ClassiX速 without changing the original code: All changes (the so-called "delta") are kept in separate source files, which only overwrite and thus change the original code when the program is executed.
