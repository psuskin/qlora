This is the description of the module "cxSalesItemPhantom" with the name "Phantom sales role": Phantom sales roles can be entered manually via the sales role, but it is also possible to generate them from an order or quotation item. This can be done in individual cases, for example if a variant that frequently occurs in the item is sold and this should be given its own number. However, it is also possible to assign a separate number to each variant sold via an option. In this case, a phantom sales role is assigned to the variant specified in the order after the sales release. If the variant does not yet exist in a phantom sales role, a new number is generated.
