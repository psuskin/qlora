> Question:
Where can I manage the holiday time of an employee?

> Answer:
Based on the information provided in the module descriptions, it appears that the "workingTimeAccount" module would be the most appropriate place to manage the holiday time of an employee. Specifically, the "Holiday file" report within the "workingTimeAccount" module seems to provide a comprehensive overview of an employee's absences, including holiday time, allowing for easy management and tracking of holiday time. Additionally, the "Copy absences" feature allows for the assignment of absences to multiple employees, making it convenient to manage holiday time for multiple employees simultaneously.

> Question:
Where can I maintain currency tables?

> Answer:
Based on the information provided in the module description, it appears that maintenance of currency tables occurs primarily through two methods:

1. Automatic updating via the internet: The module provides a function for automatic updating via the internet, using the exchange rates published daily by the European Central Bank.
2. Manual updating through the list window: Users can select a currency table by entering its ID in the "ID" field and confirming with "RETURN." They can also use the "Update" function to update currency tables of a particular name.

However, the module does not explicitly mention where users can maintain currency tables. It simply states that the currency tables can be "maintained" without specifying a location or interface for doing so. Therefore, I cannot answer the query based solely on the information provided in the module description.

To provide a more informed answer, additional context or information about the specific version of SAP ERP being used would be helpful. Additionally, if there is a specific feature or screen where currency tables are maintained, providing details about that feature or screen would also assist in answering the query.
