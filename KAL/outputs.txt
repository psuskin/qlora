    "response": "Based on the provided module description, a variant part is a description for an actually occurring part, a pattern for a distinct part, that includes an identifying number, a description, various details, such as logistic and dispositive identification, etc., and a list of characteristics that define the characteristics or quantities whose different values or characteristics can be used for an actual part.\n\nTherefore, a variant part is a kind of template or blueprint for a part that can be customized with different characteristics or values to create multiple variations of the same part. It is a way of managing variation in a product line by defining a set of common features or characteristics that can be applied to multiple parts, rather than creating separate parts for every unique combination of features.\n\nTo answer your query, a variant part is not a physical thing, but rather a conceptual representation of a part that can be created or modified based on a set of predefined characteristics or attributes.",

This description includes - as for any other part - an identifying number, a description, various details, such as logistic and dispositive identification, etc. However, a variant part is also described by means of a list of characteristics. This list of characteristics defines the characteristics or quantities whose different values or characteristics can be used for an actual part. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"320\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} If you give a value for the length and a value for the width of our sheet metal with the number 4711, then such a part is described completely exactly. Although only one (variant) part is specified (\"sheet 4711\"), by additionally specifying the values of the characteristics, it is possible to describe different characteristics of one and the same variant part and thus define different, exactly described parts. A variant part can thus be used like any other part in the system, with the difference that all values for characteristics in the characteristics list must always be specified. The advantage now is that a variant part only has to be defined once in the system, only once as master information in the part master. Nevertheless, a large number of different versions of this variant part are available for further processing in the DP system. If you need sheet metal 4711 in length=100mm and width=50mm, but at another time you need the same sheet metal in length=30mm and width=12mm, you have to enter values for length and width, but you always use the other information of the variant part already stored in the system. In principle, the characteristics of a variant part - as in our example of the sheet metal - can take any value, but valid value ranges can be assigned to the characteristics or attributes. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_variant01\" with the name \"Variant parts\" regarding Lower and individual parts: As we have seen, variant parts make particular sense when you are dealing with \"equal\" parts of the most varied characteristics/dimensions/performance. However, if some characteristics (keyword \"standard sizes\") of a variant part are used very often, it makes sense to store them as independent parts in the part master. A subpart must hold all attributes of the characteristics bar. Assuming that the two sheets of type 4711 with the dimensions 100/50 and 50/40 are frequently required, they are created in the parts master and assigned to the variant part as so-called lower parts. These subparts can also have the same part number as the variant part, but they must each have different values for the attributes length and width. As a rule of thumb, a variant part should always be created as a subpart in the system if it is kept in the warehouse. In ClassiX®, parts in the part master, which are neither variants nor subparts, are called individual parts. Individual parts can also be specified more precisely via their attributes, but these attributes are only for information purposes. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"322\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_variant01\" with the name \"Variant parts\" regarding Specifications: Specifications are automatically generated by the system if variant parts for which there is no distinct lower part are to be booked into the warehouse as surplus or remaining quantity. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_variant01\" with the name \"Variant parts\" regarding Part Rolls: Like all other parts in ClassiX®, variant parts can also have different rolls. Specifications as purchase part are described and stored in the purchase role, prices for sale in the sales role, etc. Subparts always also use the role information of the variant part assigned to them, unless they themselves have such a role object. In our example the part 4711/length=50mm and width=40mm has its own purchase role, but uses the sales role of the assigned variant part. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"324\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}.

            "chunk": "This is the description of the module \"itemVarianceAnalyze\" with the name \"Parts Variance Analyser\": The constantly changing requirements in the markets lead to a constant adaptation and expansion of the own product range (external variance). In addition, the company's own engineering and production also contributes to changes in the parts used (internal variance). This external and internal variance often leads to a constant growth of the own parts base and can lead to increasing difficulties to configure the own products customer-specific and error-free.Carefully constructed parts classes or other ontologies can help to keep an overview and order in the parts master, but they usually cannot prevent the parts master from growing per se. Also missing is the definition of a configuration logic for the own products.By introducing sustainable variant management, the growth of the parts master can be slowed down sustainably, which automatically leads to an increased overview, improved order in the parts master and overall to improved efficiency in the production process. On the other hand, the necessary configuration logic for one's own product range results almost in parallel.For this purpose, it is first necessary to find \"similar\" parts in the part master, i.e. to find and structure groups of parts in such a way that the individual members of a group can only be unambiguously described by different versions of one and the same set of characteristics. The attribute scale itself is determined by the group and is therefore valid for all members (parts) of the group.For each group of parts, a so-called variant part with its specific characteristics is then created. The parts of the group are then assigned to the variant part as so-called sub-parts, whereby the characteristics list is defined for each of these sub-parts according to the characteristics of the sub-part. The sub-parts assigned to a variant part clearly show the differences between these sub-parts with regard to the characteristic values of the features.Here it can often already be established that sub-parts have been defined unnecessarily, since their characteristics - clearly described by the characteristic bar - are quite comparable and even substitutable with other sub-parts of the same variant part.The consistent introduction of product features, product feature strips and variant parts gives the entire parts master a clear structure. The focus is no longer on the individual parts, but rather on material features, i.e. characteristics that determine the parts to be used. The rules of configuration logic then only refer to characteristics - i.e. properties - and no longer directly to part numbers.This separation of the configuration logic from part numbers also makes it possible to determine configurations with parts for which there is still \"no part number\": in this case, the configuration determines variant parts with those characteristics for which there is (still) no subpart in the variant part. This does not have to be the case, because the desired - non-existent - part is clearly specified by the variant part and the distinct attribute list. With this unambiguous specification, it can be processed throughout the entire logistics process even without a system in the part master.Variant parts and their associated lower parts with a distinct list of characteristics can thus help to increase the diversity of the product range without creating an overflowing parts master: in this way, variance can be controlled. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"itemVarianceAnalyze\" with the name \"Parts Variance Analyser\" regarding Functionality: With this module, groups of parts can be found by examining the words in the part designations. For this purpose, all part designations are first broken down into the individual words. Each of these words holds all the parts in whose part designation this word occurs. By forming intersections or unions of these individual words it is easily possible to put together groups of parts of \"similar\" parts. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"itemVarianceAnalyze\" with the name \"Parts Variance Analyser\" regarding List window: In this window, the entire functionality for analysing the variance of a parts master is summarised. The following procedure is recommended when analysing the parts variance: This procedure assigns more and more individual parts to variant parts, thus increasing the structure of the parts master.

Thus only the master data can contain upperen. The attributes that are significantly involved in the specification are mainly taken from the preceding document of the order item as well as the other higher order items. In this way, similarly constructed parts can use one and the same bill of material although they are not identically constructed. Example {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"330\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}In this example, variant control is carried out using the attributes DICKE and SORTE_METALL.Without the variant parts list, you would have to create at least two parts lists, as the raw sheet metal differs depending on the type of installation. (And two parts of course, if there were no variant parts). However, ClassiX® uses the upper option, as the example shows. In this case there are two variants, which are dependent on the attribute THICK. Depending on the attribute, the part is then used for 3.0mm or 5.0mm. The main advantage here is the maintenance of the parts lists. Since similar parts lists are combined, the processing effort is minimised, although the creation may be more complex/difficult.",

As a rule of thumb, a variant part should always be created as a subpart in the system if it is kept in the warehouse. In ClassiX®, parts in the part master, which are neither variants nor subparts, are called individual parts. Individual parts can also be specified more precisely via their attributes, but these attributes are only for information purposes. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"322\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_variant01\" with the name \"Variant parts\" regarding Specifications: Specifications are automatically generated by the system if variant parts for which there is no distinct lower part are to be booked into the warehouse as surplus or remaining quantity. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_variant01\" with the name \"Variant parts\" regarding Part Rolls: Like all other parts in ClassiX®, variant parts can also have different rolls. Specifications as purchase part are described and stored in the purchase role, prices for sale in the sales role, etc. Subparts always also use the role information of the variant part assigned to them, unless they themselves have such a role object. In our example the part 4711/length=50mm and width=40mm has its own purchase role, but uses the sales role of the assigned variant part. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"324\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_variant01\" with the name \"Variant parts\" regarding Examples: In these examples typical schemes for the use of variant parts are shown. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_variant01\" with the name \"Variant parts\" regarding Definition of semi-finished products I (cut-to-size parts): {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"326\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_variant01\" with the name \"Variant parts\" regarding Definition of semi-finished products II (linear metres of goods): {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"328\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"itemVarianceAnalyze\" with the name \"Parts Variance Analyser\": The constantly changing requirements in the markets lead to a constant adaptation and expansion of the own product range (external variance). In addition, the company's own engineering and production also contributes to changes in the parts used (internal variance). This external and internal variance often leads to a constant growth of the own parts base and can lead to increasing difficulties to configure the own products customer-specific and error-free.Carefully constructed parts classes or other ontologies can help to keep an overview and order in the parts master, but they usually cannot prevent the parts master from growing per se. Also missing is the definition of a configuration logic for the own products.By introducing sustainable variant management, the growth of the parts master can be slowed down sustainably, which automatically leads to an increased overview, improved order in the parts master and overall to improved efficiency in the production process. On the other hand, the necessary configuration logic for one's own product range results almost in parallel.For this purpose, it is first necessary to find \"similar\" parts in the part master, i.e. to find and structure groups of parts in such a way that the individual members of a group can only be unambiguously described by different versions of one and the same set of characteristics. The attribute scale itself is determined by the group and is therefore valid for all members (parts) of the group.For each group of parts, a so-called variant part with its specific characteristics is then created. The parts of the group are then assigned to the variant part as so-called sub-parts, whereby the characteristics list is defined for each of these sub-parts according to the characteristics of the sub-part. The sub-parts assigned to a variant part clearly show the differences between these sub-parts with regard to the characteristic values of the features.Here it can often already be established that sub-parts have been defined unnecessarily, since their characteristics - clearly described by the characteristic bar - are quite comparable and even substitutable with other sub-parts of the same variant part.The consistent introduction of product features, product feature strips and variant parts gives the entire parts master a clear structure. The focus is no longer on the individual parts, but rather on material features, i.e. characteristics that determine the parts to be used. The rules of configuration logic then only refer to characteristics - i.e. properties - and no longer directly to part numbers.This separation of the configuration logic from part numbers also makes it possible to determine configurations with parts for which there is still \"no part number\": in this case, the configuration determines variant parts with those characteristics for which there is (still) no subpart in the variant part. This does not have to be the case, because the desired - non-existent - part is clearly specified by the variant part and the distinct attribute list. With this unambiguous specification, it can be processed throughout the entire logistics process even without a system in the part master.Variant parts and their associated lower parts with a distinct list of characteristics can thus help to increase the diversity of the product range without creating an overflowing parts master: in this way, variance can be controlled. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"itemVarianceAnalyze\" with the name \"Parts Variance Analyser\" regarding Functionality: With this module, groups of parts can be found by examining the words in the part designations. For this purpose, all part designations are first broken down into the individual words. Each of these words holds all the parts in whose part designation this word occurs. By forming intersections or unions of these individual words it is easily possible to put together groups of parts of \"similar\" parts. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"itemVarianceAnalyze\" with the name \"Parts Variance Analyser\" regarding List window: In this window, the entire functionality for analysing the variance of a parts master is summarised. The following procedure is recommended when analysing the parts variance: This procedure assigns more and more individual parts to variant parts, thus increasing the structure of the parts master. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"itemVarianceAnalyze\" with the name \"Parts Variance Analyser\" regarding Option window: All settings for data exchange can be made here. Once set, options can be saved as the default option for the logged-in user. For this purpose, there is a context menu item on the \"Preferences\" tab in the \"User Preferences\" list, which can be used to save the current options.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"processes_variant02\" with the name \"Variant routings and parts lists\": A variant bill of material and a variant routing are characterised by the fact that they consist of conditional items, which are defined by formulas depending on attributes. Only when a bill of material is exploded are these other items exploded to \"real\" bill of material items and the master bill of material becomes a production bill of material. Thus only the master data can contain upperen. The attributes that are significantly involved in the specification are mainly taken from the preceding document of the order item as well as the other higher order items. In this way, similarly constructed parts can use one and the same bill of material although they are not identically constructed. Example {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"330\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}In this example, variant control is carried out using the attributes DICKE and SORTE_METALL.Without the variant parts list, you would have to create at least two parts lists, as the raw sheet metal differs depending on the type of installation. (And two parts of course, if there were no variant parts). However, ClassiX® uses the upper option, as the example shows. In this case there are two variants, which are dependent on the attribute THICK. Depending on the attribute, the part is then used for 3.0mm or 5.0mm. The main advantage here is the maintenance of the parts lists. Since similar parts lists are combined, the processing effort is minimised, although the creation may be more complex/difficult.\n\n### Response: Based on the provided module description, a variant part is a description for an actually occurring part, a pattern for a distinct part, that includes an identifying number, a description, various details, such as logistic and dispositive identification, etc., and a list of characteristics that define the characteristics or quantities whose different values or characteristics can be used for an actual part.\n\nTherefore, a variant part is a kind of template or blueprint for a part that can be customized with different characteristics or values to create multiple variations of the same part. It is a way of managing variation in a product line by defining a set of common features or characteristics that can be applied to multiple parts, rather than creating separate parts for every unique combination of features.\n\nTo answer your query, a variant part is not a physical thing, but rather a conceptual representation of a part that can be created or modified based on a set of predefined characteristics or attributes."

As a rule, the person object is automatically created when a new employee is created; if the person already exists, the employee information must be created by inserting a role. The listing or maintenance of employees can be done from the company master screen or one of its roles using the button This distinction becomes particularly important when a transaction document is called up from the contact person: Accordingly, the activity folder of his company or company role is inserted in addition to the activity folder of the contact person.

If only a number or a number with a unit is entered, then this input is displayed again in the appropriate format (separation of number and unit) and remains on the display until an arithmetic operation is triggered. \n\nThis is the description of the module \"qm_rates_qm\" with the name \"Conversion tables object (CX_RATE_TABLE)\": With rate tables you can test the automatic conversion between self-defined units. At the top of the window is a list containing the Current Units Conversion Table. The units can be edited by double-clicking on them or they can be created or deleted with the buttons 'Add Unit' and 'Remove Unit'. In the lower part of the window you can now convert between the units. To convert directly from one unit to another the button 'UnitConvert' is available. However, this button also requires the existence of a direct conversion rule for the units in question, otherwise the result is zero. To convert, enter the number and unit of the initial value into the field 'x'. In the field 'y' the target unit. To convert click the button. To convert over the whole table with several rules, use the button 'UnitCrossConvert'. Otherwise you proceed exactly as above. If UnitCrossConvert is not able to perform the conversion successfully (due to missing rules in the table), a display of the way the function has taken over the rules of the table appears in the window 'Trace'. To use the arithmetic functions (the buttons '+' '-' '*' '/') the table must first be registered in the system with the button 'Register table'. Now you can enter any values and units in the fields 'x' and 'y' and calculate. To make changes to the table again or just to convert it you have to log off the table with the button 'Log off table'. The field 'Rest' shows both the remainder of the conversion process and the remainder of the arithmetic functions. With the button 'ConvertIntoSmallest' a vector with the values and units from the fields 'x' and 'y' is created and it is tried to break everything down to the smallest possible unit of the table. The result then appears in the corresponding field, if no way is found the function returns zero. The menu item 'Autotest' starts a run through various conversion and calculation operations. The results are displayed in the 'Trace' window. Under the menu 'Examples' various sample numbers can be entered into the operand fields.\n\nThis is the description of the functionality of the module \"unitCalculator\" with the name \"Unit calculator\" regarding Technical Documentation: Any functionality needed to create a calculator is already available in the classes CX_NUMERIC and CX_VALUE. If this application appears to be relatively large, it is because the calculator was designed to be as comfortable as possible. The \"pure\" arithmetic operations, such as the basic arithmetic operations or, for example, the formation of reciprocal values, are all available via the above-mentioned objects. With objects of the class CX_VALUE, it is also checked whether the arithmetic operation may be carried out at all (e.g. \"2 m\" + \"4 sec\" is an illegal calculation). The main part of the application, however, deals with the graphical display of the calculator and the implementation of special calculation methods (e.g. \"point before line calculation\", \"percentage calculation\" or also \"faculty calculation\"). This application shows very clearly that basic functionality, i.e. the \"general case\", is contained in the model classes, while special requirements, such as \"dot before line calculation\" are implemented with InstantView®.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"qm_arithmetic_qm\" with the name \"Quality assurance - Arithmetic\": This test serves to test the arithmetic functions. On the left side in the first column you can enter any value for each datatype. The same way above in the first row. At the top left there are buttons for all four basic arithmetic operations, one click executes the desired operation. However, please note that some units or values may cause errors (e.g. division by zero). With the button 'sample data' randomly generated numbers can be filled in all fields. This test checks the automatic conversion of units. In the window you can see the function to be tested in one line on the left, a corresponding formula in the middle and the result on the right. The test automatically compares the calculated result with the expected value.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"qm_rounding_qm\" with the name \"Rounding\": This test checks the methods 'Round' and 'RoundAutomatically'. For the first one you have to enter arbitrary values into the fields 'Value' (if possible with decimal places) and into the fields 'Precision' the desired number of decimal places. A click on the button 'Round (Normal)' should now show the results. For Round Automatically you proceed in the same way, except that you can leave the 'Precision' fields empty, because RoundAutomatically itself recognizes from the type or unit how many decimal places are necessary.\n\n### Response: Based on the information provided in the module descriptions, I cannot answer the query \"What is Avogadro's number?\" as it is not related to the content of the modules described. Additionally, the term \"Avogadro's number\" does not appear anywhere in the module descriptions. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based solely on the information provided."

    "query": "Which parameters can I tune for my neural network?",
    "response": "Based on the information provided in the module descriptions, it appears that the \"cxNeuralNetwork\" module allows for tuning of the following parameters:\n\n1. Regression vs Classification (distinction between the two)\n2. Setup Parameters (not specified what these are)\n3. Training Parameters (not specified what these are)\n\nIt is not clear from the descriptions what specific parameters can be tuned within each category. Additionally, it is noted that some parameters cannot be changed after the initial setup, such as the distinction between regression and classification.\n\nTherefore, I would advise against providing a definitive answer to your query based solely on the information provided in the module descriptions. Instead, I suggest consulting the documentation or contacting the developers of the module for more detailed information about what parameters can be tuned and how they can be adjusted.",

            "chunk": "This is the description of the module \"processes_attribute\" with the name \"Attributes - Processes\": 2.1 Preset attribute A preset attribute allows a dynamic data field to be given a descriptive name, further explanatory data or a default setting. Example: A carpet seller with a ClassiX® software wants to describe his carpets by different characteristics. For example, all carpets should be described by their price. So he adds a characteristic to all master data, in which he can then specify the price. If individual carpets are to be described by their colour (no free input, only colours from a colour table should be available), he can do this by means of an attribute, which for example describes a data field of type 'String'. This attribute is then provided with a table with the different colours. Attention: Attribute values are only supported in the formulas up to a maximum of 100 characters! 2.2 Formula attributes As the name suggests, formula attributes are used to fill a data field with a formula, or with the value that the formula calculates. Constants can be entered directly into the formula while the variable values are slot attributes. Example: The carpet seller now wants to describe his carpets also by size, whereby the carpets have the characteristic that all carpets have the same width (4m) and differ only in length. Here the carpet seller benefits from the formula attributes. So he creates an attribute with the formula '4m * length'. The length is again a preset attribute, whereby the value or the result of the formula attribute changes automatically when the value is changed. 2.3 Conditional attributes Conditional attributes can contain a table that describes an \"if - then\" relationship. Example: The carpets of the carpet seller are to have their own price per colour. We now create a conditional attribute and fill the table with the data we need for the price calculation. (e.g.: red -> 10 € ; blue -> 20 € ; yellow -> 30€ ) In addition, we set our just created attribute in dependence of the attribute for the colour.(see example Preset attribute) If the attribute for the colour is changed, the corresponding value of the condition table is now automatically returned. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_attribute\" with the name \"Attributes - Processes\" regarding 1. why attributes?: Attributes are of central importance in ClassiX®, as they allow to describe an object (object, person object or similar) in all its characteristics without having to make changes to the source code. Example: The aim is to describe a sales item by its colour. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_attribute\" with the name \"Attributes - Processes\" regarding 6. gradual and conditional expression of attributes: Attribute nodes allow the gradual and conditional expression of attributes. This is particularly useful in product configuration (the specification of variant parts), but can also be useful when entering any form (document) or master data. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_attribute\" with the name \"Attributes - Processes\" regarding Application example for the gradual development: An application example for the gradual development of attributes is the division of a complex table of values of an attribute. Let us assume there is an attribute \"MATERIAL\". Behind this attribute there is a very large selection of different materials (various types of steel, aluminium and plastic as well as numerous alloys). This table can become very long, so it could take longer to select the right material. As a solution to this problem, the attribute \"MATERIAL\" can be created several times and the result table can be restricted in each case. So mine could create an attribute for steel, aluminium etc. and offer only the corresponding selection options as a result table. In addition you would have to create a new attribute \"MATERIAL_ART\" with the selection table: steel, aluminium, plastic and alloys. Behind this attribute, an attribute node is stored, which refers to the corresponding attribute \"MATERIAL\" depending on the set value. For example, in the sales item the attribute \"MATERIAL_ART\" is then inserted instead of the complex table \"MATERIAL\". In the order, you then first select \"MATERIAL_ART\". The corresponding attribute \"MATERIAL\" is then automatically added and in the second step this value can then be set. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_attribute\" with the name \"Attributes - Processes\" regarding Application example for the conditional gradual characteristic: The conditional characteristic behaves similarly to the application example mentioned above, but is a little more complex. In the first example, the expression of one attribute led to other attributes with the same name with filtered result tables. However, an extensive product configuration can also be carried out via the attribute nodes. Let us imagine the configuration of a car. A car can be defined by many parameters. However, these parameters can be strongly interdependent. For example, after selecting 2- or 4-door, the question of rear electric windows may be obsolete. The same applies if one of the parameters is selected as the series and various extras are then already included. This type of multi-level conditional configuration is also possible via the attribute nodes. ",

Regression vs Classification (distinction between the two)\n2. Setup Parameters (not specified what these are)\n3. Training Parameters (not specified what these are)\n\nIt is not clear from the descriptions what specific parameters can be tuned within each category. Additionally, it is noted that some parameters cannot be changed after the initial setup, such as the distinction between regression and classification.\n\nTherefore, I would advise against providing a definitive answer to your query based solely on the information provided in the module descriptions. Instead, I suggest consulting the documentation or contacting the developers of the module for more detailed information about what parameters can be tuned and how they can be adjusted."

            "chunk": "This is the description of the functionality of the module \"cxItemDemand\" with the name \"Parts requirement (Gozintograph)\" regarding Post Calculation: In order to determine which costs have actually been incurred on a cost object (e.g. sales order), all costs ? its follow-on documents must be added up. These are, for example, goods withdrawal slips, BDE deregistrations, incoming invoices etc. Some parts that are required but not planned have no follow-on documents, but must of course still be debited to the sales order. This is done for these parts using the standard quantity specified in the parts list. Only when the parts requisition is released (traffic light on green), all costs of the non-planned parts are allocated to the cost units via the final costing. All further costs arise automatically with the posting of the follow-up document. Disposition types The following disposition types are available for disposition from the parts request: Explanation of the general term \"Kanban Kanban is Japanese and means something like \"card\". It is a practical system of warehouse management in which a card is placed in each box in which parts are managed in the warehouse, under all parts at the bottom of the box. When the box is empty, the card becomes visible. Now the employee who has taken the last part out of the box must take the card and give it to the buyer indicated on the card. Depending on the replacement time of the part, there must then be 2 or more boxes of this part. Every time a box is empty, a new one is ordered. In the time in which the box is ordered but has not yet arrived or is being produced, the remaining boxes are used. 1. determination of the disposition type of the parts Based on the standard logistic identification of a part (in-house production, purchased or externally produced part) and its provision identification (disposable part, stock part, etc.), the type of disposition is automatically determined for each part in the Gozintograph. Thus, for example, non-stock-managed in-house production parts are set to the disposition type \"production order\", non-stock-managed purchased parts to the disposition type \"requirement request\" and stock parts to the disposition type \"material withdrawal\". Material staging indicators such as manual storage part are parts that actually have the MRP type \"material withdrawal\". However, since such parts are not taken from the warehouse on an order-related basis using material withdrawal slips, and are therefore not \"processed\", such parts are set to the MRP type \"No MRP\". Another irregularity is the \"special material withdrawal\". If a part requisition item is set to special material withdrawal, this requirement does not appear in the MRP account, but the item still has the status warehouse reservation - and can therefore be found via the staging list. These items must also be staged here, but no goods withdrawal documents are created. These parts also appear in the production documents as being to be taken from the warehouse. The determination of the disposition type can either be influenced automatically by separate control systems or changed manually. If, for example, a purchased part that is not normally kept in stock should have a stock (e.g. due to a return delivery from a previous order), the system automatically changes the disposition type from \"requirement request\" to\"material surplus \". The same applies to a production part in stock that may have been \"left over\" from a previous order. The parts can then be taken directly from the warehouse. Parts requisitions marked with this MRP type appear in the staging list under \"Stock reservation\". The disposition type defined in a gozintograph - automatically or manually - can therefore be quite different from the \"standard\" procurement type. The \"standard\" procurement type determines the generally valid case and is (should) not (be) changed (modified) for specific orders. A gozintograph is used to completely record the fully resolved parts lists of all parts. If a part is located below or within an assembly whose MRP type is \"requirement request\" or \"material withdrawal\", then this part or its quantity share - together with all parts of its bill of material - need not be considered further for MRP, as it is already contained in its superior assembly. For such parts, the MRP type is set to \"not required\". Conversely, if the MRP type of the superior assembly is changed to \"production order\" (if it is also an in-house produced part), the subordinate parts are automatically taken into account again in the MRP - the quantities (parts) become visible again. The MRP type\"No MRP\" thus refers to parts that are definitely needed or must be used, but should not be planned. The MRP type\"not required\", on the other hand, refers to parts that do appear in the combined bill of material but whose superior part is not to be produced (the superior part does not have the MRP type \"production order\"). The determined or manually defined disposition type is displayed in the column \"Disposition\". In the next column - if necessary - notes are displayed whether the disposition type could cause problems in the following processing stages. If the check fails, a red warning point is displayed: 2. determination of the standard procurement time according to the disposition type The standard procurement time or also replenishment lead time is taken from the production role for the MRP type \"production order\" and from the order article role of the part for the MRP type \"requirement request\". For production parts this is the pure procurement time of the corresponding level (total lead time of the routing only for this production part, not for its assemblies). It is therefore not the total \"delivery time\" of the part. For parts kept in stock (material withdrawals) a duration of 1 day is entered as standard. In addition to the standard procurement time, it is also possible to have the procurement time determined dynamically. This dynamic determination only affects parts that have received the disposition type \"production order\". Here it is now checked whether a routing has already been exploded on the possibly already attached production order. If so, the total time of the exploded routing is saved as the lead time for the parts request item. If a routing does not yet exist for the production order, or if no production order has yet been created at all, the total time of the master routing is saved as the lead time for the parts request item. 3. scheduling of the necessary provision of parts Due to the sequence of the production stages and the procurement times of the individual parts, there is a scheduling network of the parts among themselves (order network), which is best represented in the form of a Gantt diagram. In forward scheduling, this collective order starts on a predefined date (the default value is the day of planning itself). In backward scheduling, the delivery date (or the staging date, if available) is used as the starting point. It is not possible to schedule into the past, i.e. even with backward scheduling the delivery or staging date can be postponed to a later date than desired. (A corresponding warning message is automatically issued by the system, the system then automatically schedules forwards!) An influence on the delivery or provision date can be achieved by changing (shortening or extending) the procurement time: this results in an extension or shortening of the entire order network. The starting point of scheduling - e.g. the delivery or provision date in the case of backward scheduling - is first transferred to the collective order as the\"latest finish date\". If you subtract the procurement time from such a \"latest end date\", you get a\"latest start date\". The different lengths of the procurement times within a production stage result in\"earliest start dates\" for individual parts, which can be earlier than the latest start date. Adding the procurement time to the earliest start date then results in an\"earliest finish date\" again. In automatic scheduling over a period of time (e.g. \"3rd week 2014\"), the last working day of the period is set as the latest end in backward scheduling. This results in the latest start. Subsequently, the earliest start is determined from the latest start by deducting the duration of the period and the earliest end is determined on the basis of this. Excursus: The production orders are transferred to capacity planning with their respective earliest and latest completion dates . Automatic (non-graphical) forward scheduling: See the Automatic Terminationsection See also operating calendar and buffer times In the case of requirements from part requirements (departure date), the planned date is made up of the earliest and latest start, which also results in a time span. With the evaluation type \"Strict\", the earliest date of this time span is always used for the evaluation, with the setting \"Medium\" exactly the middle and with \"Soft\" the end of the time span, i.e. there is the least buffer for the real requirement. If planning (e.g. stock replenishment) is always to be carried out with a little air, the setting \"Medium\" is recommended, which is always set in the standard system. However, if there is little space in the warehouse or if the warehouse budget is always to be kept as low as possible, the setting \"Soft\" is recommended, whereby planning is always carried out on the actual demand date. Strictly means, therefore, that the goods are always already procured at the earliest possible date and may also lie in the warehouse for some time until they are needed, depending on how large the buffer times of the requirements were. 4. checking the availability of materials Checking material availability on the basis of the earliest or latest date in the parts request. This can be moved forward (with -) or backward by days or weeks. This shift is not calculated in calendar days but in working days, i.e. holidays and weekends are not included. During the check, the subsequent part requirements are normally also taken into account, i.e. parts that are available for the order are also displayed, but are in the red due to other orders. If you select the checkbox \"Ignore later requirements\", these subsequent part requirements will not be considered! On the one hand, it is possible to check the availability of stocked material on the desired date by checking the respective MRP account. The entries with the unavailable material are displayed selected in the list. On the other hand, material overhangs can be checked: If a part is by default a purchase or production part, but remaining stock (material surplus) from previous orders is still available, these entries of the list are also displayed selected for further checking. As a reaction, the MRP type can be changed, for example, from requirement request to material withdrawal, whereby this part is no longer procured via purchasing, but is instead withdrawn from existing (surplus) stock. These checks can also be graphically supported by means of a Gantt chart. 5. triggering of production orders, purchase requisitions and stock reservations Once the disposition types and dates for all parts have been defined within the gozintograph, the further documents such as production orders, purchase requisitions and stock reservations can be created automatically. 6. release of the parts requirement The release of the parts request blocks it from subsequent modification. A. Link with ex ante requirements If a sales order item is planned and preliminary requirements have been created for it, the following query appears, for example If you press \"YES\", it means that a remaining quantity still reserved over advance requirements will be withdrawn from this specific sales order, put into stock and thus released for general free disposal. If you press \"NO\" it means that you still want a remaining reserved quantity to remain available for this sales order and its further future dispositions. In case of doubt, you should therefore answer \"NO\" here, i.e. leave the reserved quantities with this sales order. B. Change in quantity Double-clicking on the part request item opens the individual disposition. Among other things, the quantity of the part requirement item can be changed there. For this purpose the editing field must be activated with the button next to the quantity specification. The quantity change is also carried out in the exploded parts list (predecessor of the parts requirement item) when saving the individual planning run. If the part requirement item has several predecessors, the system tries to distribute the quantity to all predecessors. This can result in the quantity of a BOM item being set to 0 or being greatly increased. If it is not possible to split the new quantity, a corresponding error message is issued and the quantity change is not saved. C. Deletion of direct follow-on documents(production order, requirement request, warehouse reservation) When deleting direct follow-on documents, the respective identifiers within the part request must be deleted, otherwise direct follow-on documents can no longer be created for the affected items. To remove the identifier, there is the menu item Delete in the parts request under Edit. The various identifiers can be removed with the submenu items below. ",
