Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhat is a variant part?\n\n###Input:\nThis is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_variant01\" with the name \"Variant parts\" regarding Variant parts: In ClassiX® a variant part is a description for an actually occurring part, a pattern for a distinct part. This description includes - as for any other part - an identifying number, a description, various details, such as logistic and dispositive identification, etc. However, a variant part is also described by means of a list of characteristics. This list of characteristics defines the characteristics or quantities whose different values or characteristics can be used for an actual part. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"320\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} If you give a value for the length and a value for the width of our sheet metal with the number 4711, then such a part is described completely exactly. Although only one (variant) part is specified (\"sheet 4711\"), by additionally specifying the values of the characteristics, it is possible to describe different characteristics of one and the same variant part and thus define different, exactly described parts. A variant part can thus be used like any other part in the system, with the difference that all values for characteristics in the characteristics list must always be specified. The advantage now is that a variant part only has to be defined once in the system, only once as master information in the part master. Nevertheless, a large number of different versions of this variant part are available for further processing in the DP system. If you need sheet metal 4711 in length=100mm and width=50mm, but at another time you need the same sheet metal in length=30mm and width=12mm, you have to enter values for length and width, but you always use the other information of the variant part already stored in the system. In principle, the characteristics of a variant part - as in our example of the sheet metal - can take any value, but valid value ranges can be assigned to the characteristics or attributes. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_variant01\" with the name \"Variant parts\" regarding Lower and individual parts: As we have seen, variant parts make particular sense when you are dealing with \"equal\" parts of the most varied characteristics/dimensions/performance. However, if some characteristics (keyword \"standard sizes\") of a variant part are used very often, it makes sense to store them as independent parts in the part master. A subpart must hold all attributes of the characteristics bar. Assuming that the two sheets of type 4711 with the dimensions 100/50 and 50/40 are frequently required, they are created in the parts master and assigned to the variant part as so-called lower parts. These subparts can also have the same part number as the variant part, but they must each have different values for the attributes length and width. As a rule of thumb, a variant part should always be created as a subpart in the system if it is kept in the warehouse. In ClassiX®, parts in the part master, which are neither variants nor subparts, are called individual parts. Individual parts can also be specified more precisely via their attributes, but these attributes are only for information purposes. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"322\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_variant01\" with the name \"Variant parts\" regarding Specifications: Specifications are automatically generated by the system if variant parts for which there is no distinct lower part are to be booked into the warehouse as surplus or remaining quantity. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_variant01\" with the name \"Variant parts\" regarding Part Rolls: Like all other parts in ClassiX®, variant parts can also have different rolls. Specifications as purchase part are described and stored in the purchase role, prices for sale in the sales role, etc. Subparts always also use the role information of the variant part assigned to them, unless they themselves have such a role object. In our example the part 4711/length=50mm and width=40mm has its own purchase role, but uses the sales role of the assigned variant part. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"324\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_variant01\" with the name \"Variant parts\" regarding Examples: In these examples typical schemes for the use of variant parts are shown. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_variant01\" with the name \"Variant parts\" regarding Definition of semi-finished products I (cut-to-size parts): {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"326\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_variant01\" with the name \"Variant parts\" regarding Definition of semi-finished products II (linear metres of goods): {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"328\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"itemVarianceAnalyze\" with the name \"Parts Variance Analyser\": The constantly changing requirements in the markets lead to a constant adaptation and expansion of the own product range (external variance). In addition, the company's own engineering and production also contributes to changes in the parts used (internal variance). This external and internal variance often leads to a constant growth of the own parts base and can lead to increasing difficulties to configure the own products customer-specific and error-free.Carefully constructed parts classes or other ontologies can help to keep an overview and order in the parts master, but they usually cannot prevent the parts master from growing per se. Also missing is the definition of a configuration logic for the own products.By introducing sustainable variant management, the growth of the parts master can be slowed down sustainably, which automatically leads to an increased overview, improved order in the parts master and overall to improved efficiency in the production process. On the other hand, the necessary configuration logic for one's own product range results almost in parallel.For this purpose, it is first necessary to find \"similar\" parts in the part master, i.e. to find and structure groups of parts in such a way that the individual members of a group can only be unambiguously described by different versions of one and the same set of characteristics. The attribute scale itself is determined by the group and is therefore valid for all members (parts) of the group.For each group of parts, a so-called variant part with its specific characteristics is then created. The parts of the group are then assigned to the variant part as so-called sub-parts, whereby the characteristics list is defined for each of these sub-parts according to the characteristics of the sub-part. The sub-parts assigned to a variant part clearly show the differences between these sub-parts with regard to the characteristic values of the features.Here it can often already be established that sub-parts have been defined unnecessarily, since their characteristics - clearly described by the characteristic bar - are quite comparable and even substitutable with other sub-parts of the same variant part.The consistent introduction of product features, product feature strips and variant parts gives the entire parts master a clear structure. The focus is no longer on the individual parts, but rather on material features, i.e. characteristics that determine the parts to be used. The rules of configuration logic then only refer to characteristics - i.e. properties - and no longer directly to part numbers.This separation of the configuration logic from part numbers also makes it possible to determine configurations with parts for which there is still \"no part number\": in this case, the configuration determines variant parts with those characteristics for which there is (still) no subpart in the variant part. This does not have to be the case, because the desired - non-existent - part is clearly specified by the variant part and the distinct attribute list. With this unambiguous specification, it can be processed throughout the entire logistics process even without a system in the part master.Variant parts and their associated lower parts with a distinct list of characteristics can thus help to increase the diversity of the product range without creating an overflowing parts master: in this way, variance can be controlled. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"itemVarianceAnalyze\" with the name \"Parts Variance Analyser\" regarding Functionality: With this module, groups of parts can be found by examining the words in the part designations. For this purpose, all part designations are first broken down into the individual words. Each of these words holds all the parts in whose part designation this word occurs. By forming intersections or unions of these individual words it is easily possible to put together groups of parts of \"similar\" parts. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"itemVarianceAnalyze\" with the name \"Parts Variance Analyser\" regarding List window: In this window, the entire functionality for analysing the variance of a parts master is summarised. The following procedure is recommended when analysing the parts variance: This procedure assigns more and more individual parts to variant parts, thus increasing the structure of the parts master. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"itemVarianceAnalyze\" with the name \"Parts Variance Analyser\" regarding Option window: All settings for data exchange can be made here. Once set, options can be saved as the default option for the logged-in user. For this purpose, there is a context menu item on the \"Preferences\" tab in the \"User Preferences\" list, which can be used to save the current options.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"processes_variant02\" with the name \"Variant routings and parts lists\": A variant bill of material and a variant routing are characterised by the fact that they consist of conditional items, which are defined by formulas depending on attributes. Only when a bill of material is exploded are these other items exploded to \"real\" bill of material items and the master bill of material becomes a production bill of material. Thus only the master data can contain upperen. The attributes that are significantly involved in the specification are mainly taken from the preceding document of the order item as well as the other higher order items. In this way, similarly constructed parts can use one and the same bill of material although they are not identically constructed. Example {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"330\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}In this example, variant control is carried out using the attributes DICKE and SORTE_METALL.Without the variant parts list, you would have to create at least two parts lists, as the raw sheet metal differs depending on the type of installation. (And two parts of course, if there were no variant parts). However, ClassiX® uses the upper option, as the example shows. In this case there are two variants, which are dependent on the attribute THICK. Depending on the attribute, the part is then used for 3.0mm or 5.0mm. The main advantage here is the maintenance of the parts lists. Since similar parts lists are combined, the processing effort is minimised, although the creation may be more complex/difficult.\n\n### Response: Based on the provided module description, a variant part is a description for an actually occurring part, a pattern for a distinct part, that includes an identifying number, a description, various details, such as logistic and dispositive identification, etc., and a list of characteristics that defines the characteristics or quantities whose different values or characteristics can be used for an actual part.\n\nTherefore, a variant part is a way of describing a part that allows for multiple variations or versions of the same part, each with its own unique set of characteristics or values.

I'm proud of you.\n\n###Input:\nThis is the description of the functionality of the module \"unitCalculator\" with the name \"Unit calculator\" regarding Technical Documentation: Any functionality needed to create a calculator is already available in the classes CX_NUMERIC and CX_VALUE. If this application appears to be relatively large, it is because the calculator was designed to be as comfortable as possible. The \"pure\" arithmetic operations, such as the basic arithmetic operations or, for example, the formation of reciprocal values, are all available via the above-mentioned objects. With objects of the class CX_VALUE, it is also checked whether the arithmetic operation may be carried out at all (e.g. \"2 m\" + \"4 sec\" is an illegal calculation). The main part of the application, however, deals with the graphical display of the calculator and the implementation of special calculation methods (e.g. \"point before line calculation\", \"percentage calculation\" or also \"faculty calculation\"). This application shows very clearly that basic functionality, i.e. the \"general case\", is contained in the model classes, while special requirements, such as \"dot before line calculation\" are implemented with InstantView®.\n\nThis is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_construction\" with the name \"Construction\" regarding part trunk: The ClassiX® system distinguishes between a part and the possible roles of a part. A part itself contains the descriptive data, which can be named independently of its use. A part could for example be completely described by \"carpet\". Depending on its use, one receives further data entities or roles: If the \"carpet\" is sold, sales-specific data such as sales price is maintained in the role sales article . Further roles would be order item (with data such as main supplier, last purchase price), production part (with data such as bill of material, routing, lot size), etc. In ClassiX® any role can be assigned to a part. Furthermore, a distinction is made between ClassiX® single parts, lower parts and variant parts: The advantage of processing with variant parts is that previously non-existent versions of a part do not always have to lead to data acquisition. If, for example, a customer wants a \"carpet\" with the colour pink and a \"carpet\" of this colour has never been processed before, this \"carpet\" can be ordered as a variant part with the new pink colour directly from the supplier without entering a new order article. The characteristics list of a variant part consists of various characteristics or attributes. In our example above these were the attributes colour and size. The size attribute can also be a formula attribute, i.e. it is calculated from the attributes\"length times width\". In this case, the attributes length and width must be specified in the lower part. The variant part \"carpet\" can of course be specified more precisely by means of further features. For example, the type of material (such as wool, plastic, etc.), pile thickness (in mm), pattern, etc. One could even go so far as to define all the carpets in the world as the lower part of just one variant. To do this, however, the number of characteristics would have to be increased to a point where each carpet is sufficiently distinguishable from the others. To what extent parts with different variant parts are described - or whether variant parts are used at all - depends very much on the individual case. A DIY store may have only a few (or even only one) \"carpet\" variants, whereas a carpet manufacturer will prefer a more structured structure of his \"carpet\" variants. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"273\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"}. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_construction\" with the name \"Construction\" regarding 2. parts lists: Parts lists describe the composition of a production part. A bill of material consists of parts, which in turn can have a bill of material. Each bill of material item describes which parts are required in which quantity for the production of the manufacturing part. There are two types of item: The basic heading contains a parts master record which is required in the specified (constant or calculated) quantity. A conditional BOM item is a conditional list of individual items. When exploding the BOM, the first item whose condition is fulfilled is used. If a subpart is inserted in a parts list, its characteristics are not automatically transferred, as these parts lists do not represent master data. During further processing of the parts list in orders or similar, the master data of the individual parts \"shine through\" and can then be changed later. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. For further information on purely disposable assemblies and constructive assemblies as well as instructions for creating purely disposable intermediate stages in a variant parts list, please refer to the assembly parts list documentation. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_construction\" with the name \"Construction\" regarding characteristics: Attributes are of central importance in ClassiX® because they make it possible to describe an object (material object, person object or similar) in all its characteristics without having to make changes to the source code. [[more] Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_construction\" with the name \"Construction\" regarding calculation formulas: A formula is any arithmetic expression with operators, constants, variables and function calls. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_construction\" with the name \"Construction\" regarding 5. release order items: With this module, sales order items are technically processed and released. A technical processing depends on the logistic identification of the part on the order item: If it is a production part, the order-specific production parts list can/should be generated for this part, if it is an order part, the requirement request can/should be made. For detailed information on use, please refer to the module documentation. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_construction\" with the name \"Construction\" regarding time sheets: This module is used to create and maintain time sheets. Time sheets are particularly common in service industries, where it is necessary to record services for billing purposes with customers. Accordingly, the data to be entered is designed with regard to project-related billing or for the purpose of post-calculation. Please refer to the module documentation for detailed information on use.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"dispobom\" with the name \"Disposable assembly\": With this module, the complete structure of a parts list - i.e. including the structures of all subordinate assemblies - can be changed in a production part role in order to better reflect the actual manufacturing process of the part in production. In design, assemblies are often only formed from a purely functional point of view, i.e. a \"constructive\" product structure is created which does not correspond to the \"dispositive\" product structure. Such deviations between the \"constructive\" and \"dispositive\" view of a bill of material can occur when a bill of material individual items within a subordinate assembly of this parts list are not first pre-assembled to this assembly in the production process, but are built directly into the higher-level assembly in one go(constructive assembly), individual items of the same level do not flow simultaneously, but at different times into different, higher-level(MRP-extended) assemblies (e.g. in the case of subordinate, individually loose parts that must first be provided for final assembly), or individual items are only prefabricated as sub-assemblies - not provided for by the design -(purely disposable assemblies). So if an assembly is declared as a so-called\"constructive assembly\" on the production part, this level is completely omitted in the MRP view of each higher-level assembly of this production part. If a \"dispositive assembly\" is declared on the production part, then items from different, subordinate assemblies can be \"shifted dispositively (up)\" into this assembly, i.e. the vertical range of manufacture of these items can be reduced. Finally, by defining a\"purely dispositive assembly\", individual items from any structure depth of the parts list can be combined to form a new part, a new assembly. The constructive product structure of a production part, which is built up from the point of view of design, can therefore differ considerably from the production-oriented dispositive product structure of the same production part, which also changes the structure of the part requirement. The restructuring of a product structure from the constructive to the dispositive type is defined on the basis of dispositive assembly objects which are added to a production role of a part. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"dispobom\" with the name \"Disposable assembly\" regarding Input window: An MRP assembly always refers to the production part whose MRP product structure is to be changed. If the production part itself does not have its own bill of material, i.e. if it is a purely MRP assembly, a bill of material can be freely specified, otherwise the specifications for the bill of material of the production part apply. With the button the constructive, with the button the dispositive product structure can be called up. If a production roll has a bill of material and if the MRP assembly contains an entry for a part from a subordinate assembly of this bill of material, this part is \"pushed\" below this production part when the production bill of material is exploded (reduction of the vertical range of manufacture) - according to the new MRP product structure. This also applies to purely MRP assemblies, the only difference is that in this case the production part itself does not have a bill of material, but this is specified in the purely MRP assembly itself (reduction or increase of the vertical range of manufacture). This purely MRP entry is then visible both in the initial production role (the freely selected parts list) and in the production role of the intermediate part, the purely MRP assembly. Fields. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"dispobom\" with the name \"Disposable assembly\" regarding Available product structure: The MRP product structure shows how the bill of material is later processed in production, or how the parts are planned or installed. The dispositive product structure of the parts list is displayed as a tree. The button in the upper left corner allows you to call up the constructive product structure. The following symbols are used:. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"dispobom\" with the name \"Disposable assembly\" regarding Constructive product structure: The constructive product structure of the parts list is displayed as a tree. The button in the top left corner enables the MRP product structure to be called up (see also the symbols used there).

The constructive product structure of a production part, which is built up from the point of view of design, can therefore differ considerably from the production-oriented dispositive product structure of the same production part, which also changes the structure of the part requirement. The restructuring of a product structure from the constructive to the dispositive type is defined on the basis of dispositive assembly objects which are added to a production role of a part. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"dispobom\" with the name \"Disposable assembly\" regarding Input window: An MRP assembly always refers to the production part whose MRP product structure is to be changed. If the production part itself does not have its own bill of material, i.e. if it is a purely MRP assembly, a bill of material can be freely specified, otherwise the specifications for the bill of material of the production part apply. With the button the constructive, with the button the dispositive product structure can be called up. If a production roll has a bill of material and if the MRP assembly contains an entry for a part from a subordinate assembly of this bill of material, this part is \"pushed\" below this production part when the production bill of material is exploded (reduction of the vertical range of manufacture) - according to the new MRP product structure. This also applies to purely MRP assemblies, the only difference is that in this case the production part itself does not have a bill of material, but this is specified in the purely MRP assembly itself (reduction or increase of the vertical range of manufacture). This purely MRP entry is then visible both in the initial production role (the freely selected parts list) and in the production role of the intermediate part, the purely MRP assembly. Fields. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"dispobom\" with the name \"Disposable assembly\" regarding Available product structure: The MRP product structure shows how the bill of material is later processed in production, or how the parts are planned or installed. The dispositive product structure of the parts list is displayed as a tree. The button in the upper left corner allows you to call up the constructive product structure. The following symbols are used:. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"dispobom\" with the name \"Disposable assembly\" regarding Constructive product structure: The constructive product structure of the parts list is displayed as a tree. The button in the top left corner enables the MRP product structure to be called up (see also the symbols used there).

The reason for this is that the module description does not explicitly mention anything about the relationship between the \"unitCalculator\" module and the \"processes_construction\" module. Therefore, it is unclear whether the two modules are related or not.\n\nHowever, based on the names of the modules, it is likely that they are related in some way. The \"unitCalculator\" module appears to focus on calculations and mathematical operations, while the \"processes_construction\" module seems to deal with the construction and assembly of products. It is possible that the \"unitCalculator\" module provides calculations or formulas that are used in the \"processes_construction\" module to determine the dimensions or other parameters of the finished product.\n\nWithout more information, it is difficult to say exactly how the two modules are connected. However, if you need to answer this question accurately, you might want to consult additional sources such as the documentation for the two modules or seek assistance from someone who has access to more comprehensive information about the software system."

The data connectors define possible data fields, which can also contain complex logic, and commands for loading all objects of a data connector. Reports, in turn, are based on these and use only a subset of the fields of the data connector and can filter the data. In special cases a report can also define new data fields or overwrite the commands for loading the data. While reports are intended for the end user and are used, for example, for individual lists, the data connectors are of a technical nature and not intended for direct use by end users. Data connectors can either be defined manually or created automatically from the data in a database using the Web Crawler object. The latter has the advantage that the data connectors then represent exactly the data in the database. The Web Crawler object and its logic are described on a separate page. There is a distinction between main data connectors and auxiliary data connectors. Main data connectors are created by the Web Crawler object only for main objects. Main objects are mainly objects of a REP. This logic is further refined by a blacklist and a whitelist. For more information, please see the page of the object Web Crawler. Auxiliary data connectors are created for all objects that are found but are not main objects.

The result is only returned to the input field. The following operators are provided:. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"unitCalculator\" with the name \"Unit calculator\" regarding Input via the keyboard: To simplify the input of numbers and not to have to \"assemble\" each number with the help of the corresponding keystrokes, a direct input of arithmetic expressions is possible in the display of the calculator. To do this, this field is clicked with the mouse, whereupon any expression can now be entered. If only a number or a number with a unit is entered, then this input is displayed again in the appropriate format (separation of number and unit) and remains on the display until an arithmetic operation is triggered. \n\nThis is the description of the module \"qm_rates_qm\" with the name \"Conversion tables object (CX_RATE_TABLE)\": With rate tables you can test the automatic conversion between self-defined units. At the top of the window is a list containing the Current Units Conversion Table. The units can be edited by double-clicking on them or they can be created or deleted with the buttons 'Add Unit' and 'Remove Unit'. In the lower part of the window you can now convert between the units. To convert directly from one unit to another the button 'UnitConvert' is available. However, this button also requires the existence of a direct conversion rule for the units in question, otherwise the result is zero. To convert, enter the number and unit of the initial value into the field 'x'. In the field 'y' the target unit. To convert click the button. To convert over the whole table with several rules, use the button 'UnitCrossConvert'. Otherwise you proceed exactly as above. If UnitCrossConvert is not able to perform the conversion successfully (due to missing rules in the table), a display of the way the function has taken over the rules of the table appears in the window 'Trace'. To use the arithmetic functions (the buttons '+' '-' '*' '/') the table must first be registered in the system with the button 'Register table'. Now you can enter any values and units in the fields 'x' and 'y' and calculate. To make changes to the table again or just to convert it you have to log off the table with the button 'Log off table'. The field 'Rest' shows both the remainder of the conversion process and the remainder of the arithmetic functions. With the button 'ConvertIntoSmallest' a vector with the values and units from the fields 'x' and 'y' is created and it is tried to break everything down to the smallest possible unit of the table. The result then appears in the corresponding field, if no way is found the function returns zero. The menu item 'Autotest' starts a run through various conversion and calculation operations. The results are displayed in the 'Trace' window. Under the menu 'Examples' various sample numbers can be entered into the operand fields.\n\nThis is the description of the functionality of the module \"unitCalculator\" with the name \"Unit calculator\" regarding Technical Documentation: Any functionality needed to create a calculator is already available in the classes CX_NUMERIC and CX_VALUE. If this application appears to be relatively large, it is because the calculator was designed to be as comfortable as possible. The \"pure\" arithmetic operations, such as the basic arithmetic operations or, for example, the formation of reciprocal values, are all available via the above-mentioned objects. With objects of the class CX_VALUE, it is also checked whether the arithmetic operation may be carried out at all (e.g. \"2 m\" + \"4 sec\" is an illegal calculation). The main part of the application, however, deals with the graphical display of the calculator and the implementation of special calculation methods (e.g. \"point before line calculation\", \"percentage calculation\" or also \"faculty calculation\"). This application shows very clearly that basic functionality, i.e. the \"general case\", is contained in the model classes, while special requirements, such as \"dot before line calculation\" are implemented with InstantView®.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"qm_arithmetic_qm\" with the name \"Quality assurance - Arithmetic\": This test serves to test the arithmetic functions. On the left side in the first column you can enter any value for each datatype. The same way above in the first row. At the top left there are buttons for all four basic arithmetic operations, one click executes the desired operation. However, please note that some units or values may cause errors (e.g. division by zero). With the button 'sample data' randomly generated numbers can be filled in all fields. This test checks the automatic conversion of units. In the window you can see the function to be tested in one line on the left, a corresponding formula in the middle and the result on the right. The test automatically compares the calculated result with the expected value.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"qm_rounding_qm\" with the name \"Rounding\": This test checks the methods 'Round' and 'RoundAutomatically'. For the first one you have to enter arbitrary values into the fields 'Value' (if possible with decimal places) and into the fields 'Precision' the desired number of decimal places. A click on the button 'Round (Normal)' should now show the results. For Round Automatically you proceed in the same way, except that you can leave the 'Precision' fields empty, because RoundAutomatically itself recognizes from the type or unit how many decimal places are necessary.\n\n### Response: Based on the information provided in the module descriptions, I cannot answer the query \"What is Avogadro's number?\" as it is not related to the content of the modules described.

In addition, for each original value of an output column, the value determined by means of the neural network is also output.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"cxNeuralNetwork\" with the name \"Neural network parameters\": This app is used to set the parameters of a neural network. Some parameters can/must be set directly when creating a new neural network, others can be adjusted during training. Therefore, the editing window is divided into a \"Setup Parameters\" window and a \"Training Parameters\" window.However, the first fixed setting is always a distinction between a \"Regression\" or a \"Classifying\" neural network, so this setting must be made first. Once created, this specification and the \"Setup Parameters\" can no longer be changed. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"cxNeuralNetwork\" with the name \"Neural network parameters\" regarding Network: In this window all parameters of a neural network can be defined and maintained.\n\nThis is the description of the functionality of the module \"cxNeuralNetwork2\" with the name \"Neural network\" regarding Input window: This window is used for the maintenance of neural networks.

This is the description of the functionality of the module \"classificl\" with the name \"Classifications of an object\" regarding Description of the connection: This window serves .\n\nThis is the description of the module \"cxPhrase\" with the name \"Vocabulary\": This module serves to maintain any multilingual vocabulary and is part of the multilingual dictionary in ClassiX®. It can record words or whole sentences (e.g. idioms) - so-called phrases - in any language. At the same time, the corresponding translations into other languages can be maintained. Since a word of a language can have several meanings at the same time, each word is directly assigned to one or more meanings, which - each meaning on its own - are or can be assigned to other words of other languages. Additional information about a word - such as part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), numerus (singular, plural, plural noun, etc.), case, genus, etc. allow a word to be output with all its properties by means of the grammar rules for the individual languages stored in the module: for nouns, for example, with the definite article, the singular and plural form, as well as its declension. The number and type of languages is set in the system settings; by default, the languages German, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Danish and Russian are stored in the dictionary. A built-in repetitor helps to learn words of any language. The representation of characters on Windows platforms - with a German language environment - is carried out using code page 1252. It allows words of almost all Western European languages to be recorded. In addition, the character set language in ClassiX can be changed to display characters from other languages, such as Cyrillic, Arabic, etc. (MSFonts).(MSFonts). This is the description of the functionality of the module \"cxPhrase\" with the name \"Vocabulary\" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain words in any language.

The window can only be closed with the \"OK\" button.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"qm_picture_qm\" with the name \"Image processing\": This test tries to find errors in the processing of images. After starting, the user is prompted to specify an image file. This image is then displayed in 3 different modes, once the original, then dynamically positioned and stretched. A click on the button 'Original Image' asks the user to select an image file again.\n\nThis is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_vocabulary\" with the name \"Multilingual dictionary\" regarding Morpheme: The overview begins with the smallest meaningful unit of a language, the so-called morphemes. A morpheme can also be described as the smallest semantically interpretable element of a word, i.e. a word consists of one or more morphemes.{img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"332\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Morphemes are phonetically realised as phonetic sound sequences (in units of a sound system (phonetics)), phonologically as phoneme sequences (in units of the speech system (phonology)), in writing as grapheme sequences (in units of a writing system). These sequences of sounds, phonemes or graphemes represent the morpheme in certain environments; the sounds, phonemes and graphemes themselves do not carry any meaning of their own but, as building blocks of the morpheme, only have a meaning-differentiating function. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_vocabulary\" with the name \"Multilingual dictionary\" regarding Words: A word or a combination of words is (only) the linguistic expression of a term or the direct designation of a term via its meaningful morpheme. While the term contains the mental idea of the object or fact it designates (the meaning), the designation is the linguistic sign that refers to the intended object or fact (the name). It consists of a word(one-word denomination), e.g. dog(Simplizium) or dog owner (Kompositum), or a group of words(multi-word denomination), e.g. Faraday cage. On the one hand, meaning is the knowledge of the usual use of a word or expression within a language community and a given context. Meaning is also considered to be what someone understands on the basis of a sign or a linguistic expression. A word can have one meaning (univok) or several (equivok). Univocity is the unambiguousness of the relationship between word (sign) and meaning. If there is no uniqueness, a word is ambiguous (equivok). This equivocality in a broader sense is the ambiguous relationship between sign and signified. In a narrower sense, equivok is only used to refer to words that have the same sound but different meanings. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"338\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Equivocality (ambiguity) in a broader sense occurs as homonymy (like-name), synonymy (like-sense) or analogy. If a linguistic expression (word, sign) with the same name has several meanings (pre-ambiguous relationship), one speaks of a homonym (in the broader sense) or of an equivalent expression (in the narrower sense) (example: \"bank\" for financial institution or seating furniture). In some cases, a homonymy (eponym) is only used if the origin of the word is different (example: \"Tau\" for rope coming from the Low German and for damp precipitation from the Old High German tou). This homonymy in the narrower sense is then distinguished from polysemy (ambiguity of a word with identical word origin) (example: \"horse\" for animal and gymnastic apparatus). Synonyms are different linguistic expressions with the same meaning (examples: \"grandpa\" = \"grandfather\"; \"white horse\" = \"grey horse\"). The synonymy is a post-unambiguous relationship between sign and designated. In addition to this term of synonymy in the narrower sense, synonymy (then in a broader sense) is also used in the case of words that are only related in meaning. Strict synonymy requires not only that two lexical signs have the same denotative meaning, but also that they are interchangeable in all contexts and have the same effect in all contexts. Examples of strict synonymic pairs in German are, according to general opinion: orange - orange; match - match; couch - sofa; helicopter - helicopter. A homoionym (also called partial synonym) is often confused with the widely used synonym. A homoionym would be, for example, \"car\" and \"motor vehicle\", as it is not interchangeable in every context: The opposite of synonymy is antonymy (beautiful/ugly; cold/hot). The analogy is a special case of ambiguity and \"exists when the various designated objects are in a certain relationship of dependence on each other or have a certain equality of structures\". A homograph or homoglyph is a word from a group of words which all have the same spelling but different meanings and often a different pronunciation. (Reindeer as animal and as person). With the same pronunciation it is also a homophone.). This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_vocabulary\" with the name \"Multilingual dictionary\" regarding Terms: Terms are related to each other in various ways. The generic term of a term is called a hyperonym, the subordinate term a hyponym.(Vegetable is a hyperonym of beans, tomato is a hyponym of vegetable). There are no limits to the number of levels(an animal is a hyponym of a mammal, a dog is a hyponym of an animal, a basset is a hyponym of a dog). {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"334\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} The thesaurus standards DIN 1463-1 or the international equivalent ISO 2788 provide for the following types of relations and associated abbreviations:. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_vocabulary\" with the name \"Multilingual dictionary\" regarding Languages: Language here is the verbal communication of people, consisting of words (of a vocabulary). Ferdinand de Saussure conceived language as a sign system and conceived the language sign as a compelling connection between the sound image (signifiant = the signifying) and the imagination (signifié = the signified), i.e. as something mental. A grammar puts the words in relation to each other. Words of different languages can be brought into a direct connection by their common meaning. The words \"tree\" and \"árbol\" are three different words with the same meaning. A written language represents a language using a writing system. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_vocabulary\" with the name \"Multilingual dictionary\" regarding Type systems: The main writing systems fall into the 4 categories: Logograms, syllable writing, alphabets, phonetic transcriptions:. \n\n### Response: Based on the provided module descriptions, it appears that the module \"cxNeuralNetwork\" with the name \"Neural network parameters\" might be relevant to your query.

This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_vocabulary\" with the name \"Multilingual dictionary\" regarding Type systems: The main writing systems fall into the 4 categories: Logograms, syllable writing, alphabets, phonetic transcriptions:. \n\n### Response: Based on the information provided in the module descriptions, it appears that the \"cxNeuralNetwork\" module allows for tuning of the following parameters:\n\n1. Regression vs Classifying (distinction between the two)\n2. Setup Parameters (not specified further)\n3. Training Parameters (not specified further)\n\nIt is important to note that the specific parameters that can be tuned may depend on the version of the module and the particular implementation. Additionally, some parameters may require additional information or context to determine how they should be tuned.\n\nWithout more information about the specific needs of your neural network, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer. However, if you have access to the module documentation or support resources, you may be able to find more information about the available parameters and their respective ranges and defaults."
