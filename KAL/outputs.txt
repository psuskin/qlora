    "response": "Based on the description provided, a variant part is a description for an actually occurring part, a pattern for a distinct part, in ClassiX®. It includes an identifying number, a description, various details, such as logistic and dispositive identification, etc., and is described by a list of characteristics. The list of characteristics defines the characteristics or quantities whose different values or characteristics can be used for an actual part.\n\nA variant part can be used like any other part in the system, with the difference that all values for characteristics in the characteristic list must always be specified. This allows for the creation of different, exactly described parts based on a single variant part, making it easier to manage and maintain a wide range of similar parts within the system.",

This description includes - as for any other part - an identifying number, a description, various details, such as logistic and dispositive identification, etc. However, a variant part is also described by means of a list of characteristics. This list of characteristics defines the characteristics or quantities whose different values or characteristics can be used for an actual part. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"320\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} If you give a value for the length and a value for the width of our sheet metal with the number 4711, then such a part is described completely exactly. Although only one (variant) part is specified (\"sheet 4711\"), by additionally specifying the values of the characteristics, it is possible to describe different characteristics of one and the same variant part and thus define different, exactly described parts. A variant part can thus be used like any other part in the system, with the difference that all values for characteristics in the characteristics list must always be specified. The advantage now is that a variant part only has to be defined once in the system, only once as master information in the part master. Nevertheless, a large number of different versions of this variant part are available for further processing in the DP system. If you need sheet metal 4711 in length=100mm and width=50mm, but at another time you need the same sheet metal in length=30mm and width=12mm, you have to enter values for length and width, but you always use the other information of the variant part already stored in the system.

However, if some characteristics (keyword \"standard sizes\") of a variant part are used very often, it makes sense to store them as independent parts in the part master. A subpart must hold all attributes of the characteristics bar. Assuming that the two sheets of type 4711 with the dimensions 100/50 and 50/40 are frequently required, they are created in the parts master and assigned to the variant part as so-called lower parts. These subparts can also have the same part number as the variant part, but they must each have different values for the attributes length and width. As a rule of thumb, a variant part should always be created as a subpart in the system if it is kept in the warehouse. In ClassiX®, parts in the part master, which are neither variants nor subparts, are called individual parts.

It includes an identifying number, a description, various details, such as logistic and dispositive identification, etc., and is described by a list of characteristics. The list of characteristics defines the characteristics or quantities whose different values or characteristics can be used for an actual part.\n\nA variant part can be used like any other part in the system, with the difference that all values for characteristics in the characteristic list must always be specified.

The query does not contain any specific details about Donald Trump or his background, so there is no way to provide a complete answer. However, I can offer some general information about Donald Trump based on what is publicly known about him.\n\nDonald John Trump is an American politician and businessman who served as the 45th President of the United States from 2017 to 2021. He was born in Queens, New York City, on June 14, 1946, and attended Fordham University before transferring to Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. After graduating from college, he took over his family's real estate business and later expanded into other industries such as gambling, hotels, and entertainment. In 2004, he launched The Apprentice, a reality television show that became highly popular and helped establish him as a household name.\n\nTrump ran for president in 2016 as a Republican candidate and won the election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. During his presidency, he enacted several controversial policies including building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, withdrawing from international agreements like the Paris Climate Accord, and imposing travel bans on certain countries. He also faced multiple investigations related to potential collusion between Russia and members of his campaign team during the 2016 election.\n\nHowever, without more specific information about what kind of details you are looking for regarding Donald Trump, it is difficult to provide a more comprehensive answer to your query.",

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWho is Donald Trump?\n\n###Input:\n\n\n### Response: Based on the information provided in the query, it appears that the question \"Who is Donald Trump?\" cannot be fully answered with the information provided. The query does not contain any specific details about Donald Trump or his background, so there is no way to provide a complete answer. However, I can offer some general information about Donald Trump based on what is publicly known about him.\n\nDonald John Trump is an American politician and businessman who served as the 45th President of the United States from 2017 to 2021. He was born in Queens, New York City, on June 14, 1946, and attended Fordham University before transferring to Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. After graduating from college, he took over his family's real estate business and later expanded into other industries such as gambling, hotels, and entertainment. In 2004, he launched The Apprentice, a reality television show that became highly popular and helped establish him as a household name.\n\nTrump ran for president in 2016 as a Republican candidate and won the election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. During his presidency, he enacted several controversial policies including building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, withdrawing from international agreements like the Paris Climate Accord, and imposing travel bans on certain countries. He also faced multiple investigations related to potential collusion between Russia and members of his campaign team during the 2016 election.\n\nHowever, without more specific information about what kind of details you are looking for regarding Donald Trump, it is difficult to provide a more comprehensive answer to your query."

The following properties can be manipulated via the menu line:. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"unitCalculator\" with the name \"Unit calculator\" regarding Selection of a thousand separator: Use this menu item to activate or deactivate the current separator for thousandths of a number. The separator and the increment are determined by the set location data. Usually a \".\" or \",\" is used as a separator and the step size is normally \"3\". If the separator is activated by selecting \"yes\", for example, the number \"1234.56\" is displayed as \"1,234.56\". When deactivated with \"no\", the number remains unchanged. By default the thousand separator is activated. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"unitCalculator\" with the name \"Unit calculator\" regarding Number of decimal places: This menu item sets the number of decimal places with which the numbers in the memory are to be displayed. This varies from \"exact\", i.e. displaying all decimal places, to \"3\" and \"2\" to \"none\" decimal places. By default, the numbers are displayed with all decimal places. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"unitCalculator\" with the name \"Unit calculator\" regarding Rounding of results: This menu item defines the number of decimal places to which a result is to be rounded. If \"none\" is selected, the result is not rounded at all, otherwise it is rounded to the corresponding decimal place. No rounding is performed as standard. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"unitCalculator\" with the name \"Unit calculator\" regarding Calculation operations and special keys: In the following, the arithmetic operations that can be carried out with this calculator and first the special keys are presented in more detail. The calculator has two special keys, \"AC\" and \"CE/C\". The \"CE/C\" key clears the input field and the \"AC\" key also clears the memory. The memory is not only used to visualise the previous calculations, but also to use old values as output values again. To do this, simply double-click on the desired value with the left mouse button to transfer it to the input field. The settings of the current number format remain unchanged. In addition to the four basic arithmetic operations, the calculator provides a number of operators that require only one operand to calculate the result, which is fetched from the input field. The result is only returned to the input field. The following operators are provided:. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"unitCalculator\" with the name \"Unit calculator\" regarding Input via the keyboard: To simplify the input of numbers and not to have to \"assemble\" each number with the help of the corresponding keystrokes, a direct input of arithmetic expressions is possible in the display of the calculator. To do this, this field is clicked with the mouse, whereupon any expression can now be entered. If only a number or a number with a unit is entered, then this input is displayed again in the appropriate format (separation of number and unit) and remains on the display until an arithmetic operation is triggered.

If this application appears to be relatively large, it is because the calculator was designed to be as comfortable as possible. The \"pure\" arithmetic operations, such as the basic arithmetic operations or, for example, the formation of reciprocal values, are all available via the above-mentioned objects. With objects of the class CX_VALUE, it is also checked whether the arithmetic operation may be carried out at all (e.g. \"2 m\" + \"4 sec\" is an illegal calculation). The main part of the application, however, deals with the graphical display of the calculator and the implementation of special calculation methods (e.g. \"point before line calculation\", \"percentage calculation\" or also \"faculty calculation\"). This application shows very clearly that basic functionality, i.e. the \"general case\", is contained in the model classes, while special requirements, such as \"dot before line calculation\" are implemented with InstantView®.This is the description of the functionality of the module \"unitCalculator\" with the name \"Unit calculator\" regarding Sent messages: none.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"unitCalculator\" with the name \"Unit calculator\": With this app, calculations with units can be performed quickly and easily.

Distinction between regression or classification neural network (setup parameter)\n2. Setup parameters such as learning rate, momentum, and weight decay (training parameters)\n3. Finetuning parameters such as number of layers, neurons per layer, and activation functions (training parameters)\n4. Optimization algorithm (training parameters)\n5. Regularization techniques (training parameters)\n6. Batch size (training parameters)\n7. Early stopping criteria (training parameters)\n8. Dropout rate (training parameters)\n9. Maximum epochs (training parameters)\n\nHowever, it is important to note that some of these parameters may not be applicable depending on the specific implementation of the neural network. Additionally, some parameters may require additional information or context to determine their appropriate values. Therefore, it is recommended to consult the documentation or seek assistance from a qualified professional before attempting to tune any parameters."

A. Vazsonyi* coined the term jokingly, tracing the procedure back to the (non-existent) Italian mathematician Zepartzat Gozinto, whose name stands for \"the part that (=Zepartzat) goes into (=Gozinto)\". Starting point are parts lists which describe the structure of parts. Let us assume we have an end product E1, which itself consists of the two assemblies B2 and B3 and these in turn consist of the assembly B1 and the parts T1, T2 and T3. The assembly B1 consists of the parts T1 and T2. The structure of the BOM has the following structure as a tree: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"398\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} As can be seen in this BOM view, assembly B1 and parts T1 and T2 occur several times, furthermore, parts T1 and T2 occur simultaneously at the 0. and the 1. production stage. The tree is not very clear due to this redundancy of parts and assemblies. The dispositive view (when are which parts needed for what?) of the use of parts(use or dispositive view), which is particularly important for production planning, is achieved by converting the tree into a network, the parts list network or gozintograph: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"400\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Each part and each assembly only occurs once and now only at a so-called MRP level. In ClassiX®, the level within a gozintograph is output the other way round, the topmost - to be delivered - end products are always referred to as the so-called level 0 parts, subordinate parts belong to levels 1, 2, etc. Summarised according to parts, the following list representation of the disposition of the parts results: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"402\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} The above graph can also be drawn as a Gantt chart: The representation from left to right is to express the chronological sequence of the demand for parts. Each part itself is shown as a bar, where the length of a bar represents the procurement time (for purchased parts the delivery time of the supplier, for production parts the total lead time): {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"404\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Further information: Part requirement: Module description Parts requirement: Business Pattern *Vaszony, A.: Die Planungsrechnung in Wirtschaft und Industrie, Vienna-Munich 1962.",

and can therefore be found via the staging list.These items must also be staged here, but no goods withdrawal documents are created.These parts also appear in the production documents as being to be taken from the warehouse.The determination of the disposition type can either be influenced automatically by separate control systems or changed manually.If, for example, a purchased part that is not normally kept in stock should have a stock (e.g. due to a return delivery from a previous order), the system automatically changes the disposition type from \"requirement request\" to\"material surplus \".The same applies to a production part in stock that may have been \"left over\" from a previous order.The parts can then be taken directly from the warehouse.Parts requisitions marked with this MRP type appear in the staging list under \"Stock reservation\".The disposition type defined in a gozintograph - automatically or manually - can therefore be quite different from the \"standard\" procurement type.The \"standard\" procurement type determines the generally valid case and is (should) not (be) changed (modified) for specific orders.A gozintograph is used to completely record the fully resolved parts lists of all parts.If a part is located below or within an assembly whose MRP type is \"requirement request\" or \"material withdrawal\", then this part or its quantity share - together with all parts of its bill of material - need not be considered further for MRP, as it is already contained in its superior assembly.For such parts, the MRP type is set to \"not required\".Conversely, if the MRP type of the superior assembly is changed to \"production order\" (if it is also an in-house produced part), the subordinate parts are automatically taken into account again in the MRP - the quantities (parts) become visible again.The MRP type\"No MRP\" thus refers to parts that are definitely needed or must be used, but should not be planned.The MRP type\"not required\", on the other hand, refers to parts that do appear in the combined bill of material but whose superior part is not to be produced (the superior part does not have the MRP type \"production order\").The determined or manually defined disposition type is displayed in the column \"Disposition\".In the next column - if necessary - notes are displayed whether the disposition type could cause problems in the following processing stages.If the check fails, a red warning point is displayed: 2. determination of the standard procurement time according to the disposition type The standard procurement time or also replenishment lead time is taken from the production role for the MRP type \"production order\" and from the order article role of the part for the MRP type \"requirement request\".For production parts this is the pure procurement time of the corresponding level (total lead time of the routing only for this production part, not for its assemblies).It is therefore not the total \"delivery time\" of the part.For parts kept in stock (material withdrawals) a duration of 1 day is entered as standard.In addition to the standard procurement time, it is also possible to have the procurement time determined dynamically.This dynamic determination only affects parts that have received the disposition type \"production order\".Here it is now checked whether a routing has already been exploded on the possibly already attached production order.If so, the total time of the exploded routing is saved as the lead time for the parts request item.",

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhat is a gozintograph?\n\n###Input:\nThis is the description of the module \"gozinto\" with the name \"Gozintograph\": A gozintograph is a graph that is used in production planning to calculate product and partial requirements and as a preliminary stage for production scheduling and machine allocation planning. A. Vazsonyi* coined the term jokingly, tracing the procedure back to the (non-existent) Italian mathematician Zepartzat Gozinto, whose name stands for \"the part that (=Zepartzat) goes into (=Gozinto)\". Starting point are parts lists which describe the structure of parts. Let us assume we have an end product E1, which itself consists of the two assemblies B2 and B3 and these in turn consist of the assembly B1 and the parts T1, T2 and T3. The assembly B1 consists of the parts T1 and T2. The structure of the BOM has the following structure as a tree: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"398\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} As can be seen in this BOM view, assembly B1 and parts T1 and T2 occur several times, furthermore, parts T1 and T2 occur simultaneously at the 0. and the 1. production stage. The tree is not very clear due to this redundancy of parts and assemblies. The dispositive view (when are which parts needed for what?) of the use of parts(use or dispositive view), which is particularly important for production planning, is achieved by converting the tree into a network, the parts list network or gozintograph: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"400\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Each part and each assembly only occurs once and now only at a so-called MRP level. In ClassiX®, the level within a gozintograph is output the other way round, the topmost - to be delivered - end products are always referred to as the so-called level 0 parts, subordinate parts belong to levels 1, 2, etc. Summarised according to parts, the following list representation of the disposition of the parts results: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"402\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} The above graph can also be drawn as a Gantt chart: The representation from left to right is to express the chronological sequence of the demand for parts. Each part itself is shown as a bar, where the length of a bar represents the procurement time (for purchased parts the delivery time of the supplier, for production parts the total lead time): {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"404\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} Further information: Part requirement: Module description Parts requirement: Business Pattern *Vaszony, A.: Die Planungsrechnung in Wirtschaft und Industrie, Vienna-Munich 1962.\n\nThis is the description of the functionality of the module \"cxItemDemand\" with the name \"Parts requirement (Gozintograph)\" regarding Post Calculation: In order to determine which costs have actually been incurred on a cost object (e.g. sales order), all costs ?its follow-on documents must be added up.These are, for example, goods withdrawal slips, BDE deregistrations, incoming invoices etc.Some parts that are required but not planned have no follow-on documents, but must of course still be debited to the sales order.This is done for these parts using the standard quantity specified in the parts list.Only when the parts requisition is released (traffic light on green), all costs of the non-planned parts are allocated to the cost units via the final costing.All further costs arise automatically with the posting of the follow-up document.Disposition types The following disposition types are available for disposition from the parts request: Explanation of the general term \"Kanban Kanban is Japanese and means something like \"card\".It is a practical system of warehouse management in which a card is placed in each box in which parts are managed in the warehouse, under all parts at the bottom of the box.When the box is empty, the card becomes visible.Now the employee who has taken the last part out of the box must take the card and give it to the buyer indicated on the card.Depending on the replacement time of the part, there must then be 2 or more boxes of this part.Every time a box is empty, a new one is ordered.In the time in which the box is ordered but has not yet arrived or is being produced, the remaining boxes are used.1. determination of the disposition type of the parts Based on the standard logistic identification of a part (in-house production, purchased or externally produced part) and its provision identification (disposable part, stock part, etc.), the type of disposition is automatically determined for each part in the Gozintograph.Thus, for example, non-stock-managed in-house production parts are set to the disposition type \"production order\", non-stock-managed purchased parts to the disposition type \"requirement request\" and stock parts to the disposition type \"material withdrawal\".Material staging indicators such as manual storage part are parts that actually have the MRP type \"material withdrawal\".However, since such parts are not taken from the warehouse on an order-related basis using material withdrawal slips, and are therefore not \"processed\", such parts are set to the MRP type \"No MRP\".Another irregularity is the \"special material withdrawal\".If a part requisition item is set to special material withdrawal, this requirement does not appear in the MRP account, but the item still has the status warehouse reservation -

However, I can suggest some possibilities based on my understanding of the text.\n\nFirstly, it seems likely that \"gozintograph\" is a misspelling or typo of \"gonzo graph,\" which would make sense considering the context of the module description. A gonzo graph is a diagram used in journalism to illustrate complex relationships between multiple subjects. It's named after Hunter S. Thompson, who popularized the style in his writings.\n\nAlternatively, \"gozintograph\" could be a made-up word or a mistake in translation. Without more information about the original source of the module description, it's difficult to say for sure.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query without additional context or clarification."

and can therefore be found via the staging list.These items must also be staged here, but no goods withdrawal documents are created.These parts also appear in the production documents as being to be taken from the warehouse.The determination of the disposition type can either be influenced automatically by separate control systems or changed manually.If, for example, a purchased part that is not normally kept in stock should have a stock (e.g. due to a return delivery from a previous order), the system automatically changes the disposition type from \"requirement request\" to\"material surplus \".The same applies to a production part in stock that may have been \"left over\" from a previous order.The parts can then be taken directly from the warehouse.Parts requisitions marked with this MRP type appear in the staging list under \"Stock reservation\".The disposition type defined in a gozintograph - automatically or manually - can therefore be quite different from the \"standard\" procurement type.The \"standard\" procurement type determines the generally valid case and is (should) not (be) changed (modified) for specific orders.A gozintograph is used to completely record the fully resolved parts lists of all parts.If a part is located below or within an assembly whose MRP type is \"requirement request\" or \"material withdrawal\", then this part or its quantity share - together with all parts of its bill of material - need not be considered further for MRP, as it is already contained in its superior assembly.For such parts, the MRP type is set to \"not required\".Conversely, if the MRP type of the superior assembly is changed to \"production order\" (if it is also an in-house produced part), the subordinate parts are automatically taken into account again in the MRP - the quantities (parts) become visible again.The MRP type\"No MRP\" thus refers to parts that are definitely needed or must be used, but should not be planned.The MRP type\"not required\", on the other hand, refers to parts that do appear in the combined bill of material but whose superior part is not to be produced (the superior part does not have the MRP type \"production order\").The determined or manually defined disposition type is displayed in the column \"Disposition\".In the next column - if necessary - notes are displayed whether the disposition type could cause problems in the following processing stages.If the check fails, a red warning point is displayed: 2. determination of the standard procurement time according to the disposition type The standard procurement time or also replenishment lead time is taken from the production role for the MRP type \"production order\" and from the order article role of the part for the MRP type \"requirement request\".For production parts this is the pure procurement time of the corresponding level (total lead time of the routing only for this production part, not for its assemblies).It is therefore not the total \"delivery time\" of the part.For parts kept in stock (material withdrawals) a duration of 1 day is entered as standard.In addition to the standard procurement time, it is also possible to have the procurement time determined dynamically.This dynamic determination only affects parts that have received the disposition type \"production order\".Here it is now checked whether a routing has already been exploded on the possibly already attached production order.If so, the total time of the exploded routing is saved as the lead time for the parts request item.",

The description focuses primarily on the technical aspects of the tool, such as its features and functionalities, rather than its intended uses or applications. Additionally, the description does not provide any explicit statements about the purpose or goals of using a gozintograph. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based solely on the provided module description. However, I suggest consulting other resources or seeking additional context to better understand the purpose and usage of a gozintograph."

Additionally, the gozintograph allows for visualization of the chronological sequence of demands for parts and enables direct rescheduling or changing of throughput times of work sequences. It also considers operating calendars specific to each production area or workstation."

    "response": "Based on the descriptions provided, I can answer your query as follows:\n\nA material characteristic is a distinct feature or property of a material that can be measured or observed. In other words, it is a trait or attribute of the material that sets it apart from other materials.\n\nThere are three types of material characteristics existing in the Module \"Attribut\" with the name \"Attribute (module)\", namely:\n\n1. Preset Material Characteristic\n2. Calculated Material Characteristic\n3. Conditional Material Characteristic\n\nPreset Material Characteristics are predefined traits or attributes of a material that cannot be changed or modified. They are typically fixed values that describe the essential properties of the material.\n\nCalculated Material Characteristics, on the other hand, are derived from formulas or calculations based on other attributes or characteristics of the material. These characteristics can change depending on the context or application they are being used in.\n\nConditional Material Characteristics are dependent on certain conditions or scenarios. They are dynamic and can vary based on the specific situation or environment the material is exposed to.\n\nPlease note that the information provided is based on the descriptions given, and there might be additional details or nuances that require clarification or elaboration.",

This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_construction\" with the name \"Construction\" regarding part trunk: The ClassiX® system distinguishes between a part and the possible roles of a part. A part itself contains the descriptive data, which can be named independently of its use. A part could for example be completely described by \"carpet\". Depending on its use, one receives further data entities or roles: If the \"carpet\" is sold, sales-specific data such as sales price is maintained in the role sales article . Further roles would be order item (with data such as main supplier, last purchase price), production part (with data such as bill of material, routing, lot size), etc. In ClassiX® any role can be assigned to a part. Furthermore, a distinction is made between ClassiX® single parts, lower parts and variant parts: The advantage of processing with variant parts is that previously non-existent versions of a part do not always have to lead to data acquisition. If, for example, a customer wants a \"carpet\" with the colour pink and a \"carpet\" of this colour has never been processed before, this \"carpet\" can be ordered as a variant part with the new pink colour directly from the supplier without entering a new order article. The characteristics list of a variant part consists of various characteristics or attributes. In our example above these were the attributes colour and size. The size attribute can also be a formula attribute, i.e. it is calculated from the attributes\"length times width\". In this case, the attributes length and width must be specified in the lower part. The variant part \"carpet\" can of course be specified more precisely by means of further features. For example, the type of material (such as wool, plastic, etc.), pile thickness (in mm), pattern, etc. One could even go so far as to define all the carpets in the world as the lower part of just one variant. To do this, however, the number of characteristics would have to be increased to a point where each carpet is sufficiently distinguishable from the others. To what extent parts with different variant parts are described - or whether variant parts are used at all - depends very much on the individual case.

In other words, it is a trait or attribute of the material that sets it apart from other materials.\n\nThere are three types of material characteristics existing in the Module \"Attribut\" with the name \"Attribute (module)\", namely:\n\n1. Preset Material Characteristic\n2. Calculated Material Characteristic\n3. Conditional Material Characteristic\n\nPreset Material Characteristics are predefined traits or attributes of a material that cannot be changed or modified. They are typically fixed values that describe the essential properties of the material.\n\nCalculated Material Characteristics, on the other hand, are derived from formulas or calculations based on other attributes or characteristics of the material. These characteristics can change depending on the context or application they are being used in.\n\nConditional Material Characteristics are dependent on certain conditions or scenarios. They are dynamic and can vary based on the specific situation or environment the material is exposed to.\n\nPlease note that the information provided is based on the descriptions given, and there might be additional details or nuances that require clarification or elaboration."

    "query": "How do I plan production orders?",
    "response": "Based on the information provided in the module description, it appears that planning production orders involves several steps, including generating production orders automatically from parts requests, defining work plans for each production order item, and making changes to the work plan after posting the work times. Additionally, the module allows for changing the dates of production orders that have already been fully booked and possibly even partially completed.\n\nTo plan production orders, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Generate production orders automatically from parts requests.\n2. Define work plans for each production order item.\n3. Make changes to the work plan after posting the work times.\n4. Change the dates of production orders that have already been fully booked and possibly even partially completed.\n\nIt is important to note that some of these steps may require additional information or inputs, such as the definition of work plans and the making of changes to the work plan after posting the work times. Furthermore, if work sequences for which PDA feedback has already been received need to be removed, they can either be set to \"completed\" with any remaining time that has not yet been reported or the status of the work sequence can be changed directly from the worklist to \"completed.\"\n\nOverall, planning production orders involves various stages, including generating production orders, defining work plans, making changes to the work plan, and changing the dates of production orders when necessary.",

(After releasing a part request, you automatically branch to the processing screen of the generated production orders).New production order items can also be opened manually (i.e. production order items without a predecessor), in which case the input option for assignment to a cost centre opens automatically.A work plan must always be defined for each individual production order item. This is generally generated production-specific from the master routing(Explode routing). In the same step the respective start and end times of each work sequence are determined by means of backward scheduling, taking into account the controlled throughput times.

If, after processing, the total time of all work sequences of a production order item is longer or shorter than planned in parts scheduling, the production order item (or the work centre times) cannot be posted because the throughput times on the production order and parts request differ.

All Explained in keywords, the change in the work sequences looks like this:. \n\n### Response: Based on the information provided in the module description, it appears that planning production orders involves several steps, including generating production orders automatically from parts requests, defining work plans for each production order item, and making changes to the work plan after posting the work times. Additionally, the module allows for changing the dates of production orders that have already been fully booked and possibly even partially completed.\n\nTo plan production orders, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Generate production orders automatically from parts requests.\n2. Define work plans for each production order item.\n3. Make changes to the work plan after posting the work times.\n4. Change the dates of production orders that have already been fully booked and possibly even partially completed.\n\nIt is important to note that some of these steps may require additional information or inputs, such as the definition of work plans and the making of changes to the work plan after posting the work times. Furthermore, if work sequences for which PDA feedback has already been received need to be removed, they can either be set to \"completed\" with any remaining time that has not yet been reported or the status of the work sequence can be changed directly from the worklist to \"completed.\"\n\nOverall, planning production orders involves various stages, including generating production orders, defining work plans, making changes to the work plan, and changing the dates of production orders when necessary."

    "query": "What are specification numbers?",
    "response": "Based on the provided module descriptions, I cannot determine what \"specification numbers\" are. The terms \"specification numbers,\" \"characteristic,\" and \"variant part\" are mentioned throughout the descriptions, but there is no clear explanation of what these terms mean or how they relate to one another. Additionally, some of the descriptions seem to contradict each other, making it even more confusing.\n\nFor instance, the description of the module \"cxPattItemNumber\" mentions that specifications are automatically generated by the system if variant parts for which there is no distinct sub-part are to be booked into the warehouse as surplus or remaining quantity. However, the description of the module \"serinumb\" states that serial numbers are unique and are used to identify one or more parts. These conflicting statements make it difficult to understand what \"specification numbers\" might refer to.\n\nTherefore, I must conclude that the query cannot be answered based solely on the information provided in the module descriptions. Additional context or clarification would be needed to accurately respond to the query.",

            "chunk": "This is the description of the module \"processes_variant04\" with the name \"Variant Specification\": The use of variant parts can be difficult when it comes to giving a third party - for example a customer - a part name, because a (variant) part is not only described exactly by its part number but also by the distinct list of characteristics. For example, the variant part sheet metal (\"4711\") is described by the additional specification of length and width. So the customer orders \"4711 in length equal 50cm and width equal 25cm. This way of describing a part can be optimised by naming this combination. This can be useful if the expression of the part is a frequently used variant. you find it difficult to understand a variant part. the customer has a separate number for this variant and would like to order via this number. Three possibilities are considered for the specification of a variant part to the outside: 1. specification of the sales item Sales roles of a variant part in a unique characteristic can be assigned their own numbers. The sheet \"4711 in length equal 50cm and width equal 25cm\" from the example could thus be assigned the number \"4711-0001\" or \"BL1129\". If the customer orders via this number, it is immediately clear which part he wants to purchase in which specification. When entering the order item, inserting the sales role via the specification number eliminates the need to define the characteristics, as these are specified and adopted by the specification. Specification numbers can be entered manually via the sales role, but it is also possible to generate them from an order item. This can be done in individual cases, for example if a variant that frequently occurs in the order item is sold and this should be given its own number. However, it is also possible to assign a separate number to each variant sold via an option. In this case, a specification number is assigned to the variant specified in the order after the sales release. If the variant does not yet exist in a specification, a new number is generated. Once the specification has been defined, the characteristics are locked and can no longer be changed. Attention! If the characteristics of a specification are changed and there are orders that already have successor documents (delivery notes, invoices, etc.). A new specification is created. 2. the customer's own number The customer 's own number is <->entered via the customer agreement (article <->customer data). If the article is a variant part, there may be several customer's own numbers for the same variant part. In this case, the customer's own numbers are stored as a conditional table in the customer agreement. There are now several scenarios for using this unique number. One possibility is that the customer orders via his own number. When creating the order item and selecting the article, it is possible to search for it using the customer's own number. In the order item, not only the corresponding article is then transferred, but also the characteristics are automatically defined. The own number not only determines the article (the variant part) but also the variant (the characteristics). If an order item is entered \"normally\", i.e. by selecting the article and then defining the characteristics, the system searches for a customer's own number corresponding to this combination when the order confirmation is printed. 3. supplier's own number The supplier's own numbers are stored in the supplier agreement. For variant parts, these numbers can also be created as a conditional table. In the order, the (Varainten) part and the characteristic is specified. When the order is printed, the corresponding supplier's own number is then determined on the basis of the conditional table and printed with it. 4. materials managementIf variant parts with a characteristics list are to be booked into a warehouse for interim storage or storage of surplus quantities, a phantom part is created for these if a counter and a table for specifications have been defined in the variant part. A standard price and the average price are managed for these and can be maintained. All characteristics are saved in the phantom part. If the defined length of the number for the phantom parts and the specifications in counters are the same, the number of the specification for the phantom part is adopted. The conclusion can be summed up, that specification numbers make the communication and use of variant parts easier and clearer. that a variant of a variant part can also be determined and named without having to stamp out lower parts.",

The terms \"specification numbers,\" \"characteristic,\" and \"variant part\" are mentioned throughout the descriptions, but there is no clear explanation of what these terms mean or how they relate to one another. Additionally, some of the descriptions seem to contradict each other, making it even more confusing.\n\nFor instance, the description of the module \"cxPattItemNumber\" mentions that specifications are automatically generated by the system if variant parts for which there is no distinct sub-part are to be booked into the warehouse as surplus or remaining quantity. However, the description of the module \"serinumb\" states that serial numbers are unique and are used to identify one or more parts. These conflicting statements make it difficult to understand what \"specification numbers\" might refer to.\n\nTherefore, I must conclude that the query cannot be answered based solely on the information provided in the module descriptions. Additional context or clarification would be needed to accurately respond to the query."

    "query": "How do I implement attributes into subject characteristics bars?",
    "response": "Based on the provided module descriptions, it seems that implementing attributes into subject characteristics bars involves several steps. Firstly, you would need to create a new attribute object using the \"Attrisat\" module, and then edit its properties such as name, data type, and default value. Once the attribute object is created, you can insert it into the subject characteristics bar using the \"Attrisit\" module.\n\nTo insert an attribute into the subject characteristics bar, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the \"Attrisit\" module and click on the \"Insert\" button.\n2. Select the newly created attribute object from the \"Attrisat\" module.\n3. Click on the \"OK\" button to confirm the insertion of the attribute into the subject characteristics bar.\n4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for each attribute you wish to add to the subject characteristics bar.\n5. Use the \"Arrow\" buttons to rearrange the order of the attributes in the subject characteristics bar.\n6. Right-click on an attribute to access the context menu and choose \"Edit\" to modify the attribute's properties.\n7. Double-click on an attribute to open the attribute editor and modify the attribute's value.\n\nIt is important to note that some attributes may require additional setup before they can be inserted into the subject characteristics bar. For instance, calculated attributes may need to have their formulas defined before they can be inserted. Similarly, conditional attributes may require the definition of conditions under which they become active.\n\nAdditionally, it is recommended to place all attributes of a variant part at the beginning of the attribute list in the desired order to avoid conflicts with other attributes. This ensures that the attributes are easily accessible and can be modified as needed.",

This is the description of the functionality of the module \"attrilst\" with the name \"Attributes\" regarding Test window: This window is used to calculate the value of an attribute object.\n\n### Response: Based on the provided module descriptions, it seems that implementing attributes into subject characteristics bars involves several steps. Firstly, you would need to create a new attribute object using the \"Attrisat\" module, and then edit its properties such as name, data type, and default value. Once the attribute object is created, you can insert it into the subject characteristics bar using the \"Attrisit\" module.\n\nTo insert an attribute into the subject characteristics bar, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the \"Attrisit\" module and click on the \"Insert\" button.\n2. Select the newly created attribute object from the \"Attrisat\" module.\n3. Click on the \"OK\" button to confirm the insertion of the attribute into the subject characteristics bar.\n4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for each attribute you wish to add to the subject characteristics bar.\n5. Use the \"Arrow\" buttons to rearrange the order of the attributes in the subject characteristics bar.\n6. Right-click on an attribute to access the context menu and choose \"Edit\" to modify the attribute's properties.\n7. Double-click on an attribute to open the attribute editor and modify the attribute's value.\n\nIt is important to note that some attributes may require additional setup before they can be inserted into the subject characteristics bar. For instance, calculated attributes may need to have their formulas defined before they can be inserted. Similarly, conditional attributes may require the definition of conditions under which they become active.\n\nAdditionally, it is recommended to place all attributes of a variant part at the beginning of the attribute list in the desired order to avoid conflicts with other attributes. This ensures that the attributes are easily accessible and can be modified as needed."

Additionally, the moving average price of the part is influenced by the storage, depending on the setting for determining the average price on the client.\n\nThe standard price from the production or order roll is used for valuation purposes, such as calculating the moving average price of the part. On the other hand, the price from the previous document is used for determining the actual price of the part during storage.\n\nIt's important to note that the evaluation of parts in the warehouse also takes into consideration other factors, such as the existence of a preceding document, the availability of an average price in the warehouse account, and the use of a cost center or cost unit. These factors can affect the final price of the part and how it is evaluated in the warehouse statistics."

    "query": "What is a price table?",
    "response": "Based on the information provided in the module descriptions, I can determine that a price table is a feature in the \"Processes Sales Pricing\" module that enables the creation of complex prices or discounts and surcharges. It allows users to define prices based on various attributes or data fields, such as quantity, product category, or customer group. Additionally, it provides options for assigning surcharges and discounts to specific products or customers.\n\nThe price table feature offers several benefits, including:\n\n1. Variability: Users can define customized prices for different products or customers, allowing for greater flexibility in pricing strategies.\n2. Efficiency: By storing prices and conditions in a single table, users can streamline the process of creating quotes and orders, reducing errors and saving time.\n3. Transparency: With the ability to view all prices and conditions in one place, users can easily monitor and manage their pricing policies.\n4. Flexibility: The price table feature allows for easy updates and modifications to existing prices and conditions, ensuring that the system remains current and accurate.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the price table feature requires careful management and maintenance to ensure accuracy and consistency across all relevant documents. Users must regularly review and update their price tables to reflect changing market conditions, supply chain fluctuations, or other external factors that may impact pricing decisions.",

If, for example, prices of several articles are changed and the new price is always only valid from the turn of the year, the changeover date, which is preset with the session date, can be overwritten.\n\nThis is the description of the functionality of the module \"pcalcgrp\" with the name \"Pricing group\" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain pricing groups. You can select a pricing group by entering the desired number in the Number field and confirming with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". This is the description of the functionality of the module \"pcalcgrp\" with the name \"Pricing group\" regarding List window: Used to list the pricing groups. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"pcalcgrp\" with the name \"Pricing group\" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select a pricing group. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"pcalcgrp\" with the name \"Pricing group\" regarding Subgroup window: This window allows you to insert a pricing group subgroup.\n\n### Response: Based on the information provided in the module descriptions, I can determine that a price table is a feature in the \"Processes Sales Pricing\" module that enables the creation of complex prices or discounts and surcharges. It allows users to define prices based on various attributes or data fields, such as quantity, product category, or customer group. Additionally, it provides options for assigning surcharges and discounts to specific products or customers.\n\nThe price table feature offers several benefits, including:\n\n1. Variability: Users can define customized prices for different products or customers, allowing for greater flexibility in pricing strategies.\n2. Efficiency: By storing prices and conditions in a single table, users can streamline the process of creating quotes and orders, reducing errors and saving time.\n3. Transparency: With the ability to view all prices and conditions in one place, users can easily monitor and manage their pricing policies.\n4. Flexibility: The price table feature allows for easy updates and modifications to existing prices and conditions, ensuring that the system remains current and accurate.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the price table feature requires careful management and maintenance to ensure accuracy and consistency across all relevant documents. Users must regularly review and update their price tables to reflect changing market conditions, supply chain fluctuations, or other external factors that may impact pricing decisions."

    "query": "What are conditional parts list items?",
    "response": "Based on the provided module descriptions, I can confidently answer your query. Conditional parts list items, also known as variant parts, are described in the module \"billofma\" with the name \"Parts lists.\" They are defined as a conditional list of individual BOM items, allowing for different characteristics of the part to be produced. These items can be included in sets, and their quantities can be specified using formulas or conditional tables.\n\nWhen exploding the bill of materials, the system uses the first position whose condition is fulfilled, ensuring that the correct component is included in the final assembly. Additionally, the system allows for the creation of a new parts list by selecting a parts list number and confirming with RETURN.\n\nOverall, conditional parts list items provide flexibility in producing various versions of a product, enabling the creation of customized assemblies based on specific requirements.",

Then the complete structure of the called up parts list is displayed - including all structures of the sub parts lists occurring in the parts list itself. This output is for viewing only, editing is (currently) not possible. The structured parts list can also be displayed in list form (radio button), for this purpose you can also specify the desired depth to which you want to track the parts lists. (The parts list report is only recommended in this list display) With the checkbox \"also display invalid items\" all items of the parts list can be displayed, i.e. also those on invalid set parts list items. With the button you can display the MRP product structure of the bill of material. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"billofma\" with the name \"Parts lists\" regarding Inspection parts list: You can check whether the parts list has been entered correctly via the menu item 'Parts list inspection'. The window 'Inspection Bill of Material' opens. Via 'Edit - Resolve' you can select the scope of the test and via 'Edit - Delete test resolutions' you can undo tests. If a parts list cannot be exploded, the system will display an error message. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"billofma\" with the name \"Parts lists\" regarding Renumber parts list items: This window is used to enter the information for a new numbering of the parts list items. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"billofma\" with the name \"Parts lists\" regarding List window: Serves on the one hand to list (headers) of parts lists and on the other hand as a starting point for listing and checking routines for parts list items. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"billofma\" with the name \"Parts lists\" regarding Bill of material items (across different bills of material): In this window, the positions of the parts lists previously selected in the list window are displayed. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"billofma\" with the name \"Parts lists\" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select a parts list. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"billofma\" with the name \"Parts lists\" regarding Option window: All settings for the search can be made here. The window can only be closed with the \"OK\" button. \n\n### Response: Based on the provided module descriptions, I can confidently answer your query. Conditional parts list items, also known as variant parts, are described in the module \"billofma\" with the name \"Parts lists.\" They are defined as a conditional list of individual BOM items, allowing for different characteristics of the part to be produced. These items can be included in sets, and their quantities can be specified using formulas or conditional tables.\n\nWhen exploding the bill of materials, the system uses the first position whose condition is fulfilled, ensuring that the correct component is included in the final assembly. Additionally, the system allows for the creation of a new parts list by selecting a parts list number and confirming with RETURN.\n\nOverall, conditional parts list items provide flexibility in producing various versions of a product, enabling the creation of customized assemblies based on specific requirements."

    "query": "How do I import my inventory data into GESTIN?",
    "response": "Based on the information provided in the module description, it appears that GESTIN is designed to work with existing ERP or merchandise management systems to streamline the inventory process. However, there is no direct mention of how to import inventory data into GESTIN.\n\nTo clarify, if you would like to import your inventory data into GESTIN, you may need to consult the documentation or support resources provided by the manufacturer of your ERP or merchandise management system. They may offer guidance on how to export your inventory data and import it into GESTIN. Alternatively, you could reach out to the developer of GESTIN directly for assistance.\n\nIt's important to note that the module description does mention the ability to transfer data from the leading inventory system to the GESTIN software, but it doesn't provide details on how to do so. Therefore, I cannot answer the query based solely on the information provided in the module description.",

    "query": "What does PYTHIA do?",
    "response": "Based on the descriptions provided, it appears that PYTHIA is a software solution designed to assist organizations in preventing terrorist financing and money laundering by screening individuals and entities against various sanctions lists. Specifically, PYTHIA seems to offer features such as:\n\n* Importing and updating sanctions lists from multiple sources, including the European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the United States.\n* Comparing individuals and companies in the PYTHIA database against the imported sanctions lists.\n* Logging and storing hits found during the comparison process.\n* Providing a list of all hits and allowing users to transfer hits to a blacklist or whitelist after manual checking.\n* Allowing users to edit communication objects and roles associated with specific persons.\n\nHowever, based solely on the information provided, I cannot determine what exactly PYTHIA does. It is unclear how the software actually performs the screenings or what actions it takes when hits are found. Additionally, there is no mention of any automated blocking or alerting functions that might indicate whether PYTHIA is capable of detecting potential terrorists or criminals. Therefore, I would say that the answer to the query \"What does PYTHIA do?\" is not fully answered by the given information.",

Persons, companies or one-time addresses that are transferred to a blacklist can be automatically blocked in the host system for any business use.At the end, each logged comparison should be processed so that all hits are listed either in the blacklist or whitelist. Hits already known from the whitelist are only automatically transferred back to a checklist to be checked if something has changed in the sanctions lists in this regard.To obtain an initial overview, you can carry out a mass comparison without a log. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"solutions_pythia\" with the name \"PYTHIA - Sanctions list check\" regarding Main window: {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"559\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"350\"} The sanctions list monitor has been directly integrated into the main window. This gives you direct access to current hits and allows you to manage your lists (black/white/check). In the lower area, companies and persons can be imported manually and compared with existing ones. This import updates existing entries and adds new entries. After the import, you can list all entries that were not part of the last import in order to set them to invalid, for example, via \"Menu to app\". You can also compare your imported business partners with the sanctions lists or call up the sanctions list search. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"solutions_pythia\" with the name \"PYTHIA - Sanctions list check\" regarding Sanctions list overview: EU - Sanctions list of the European Union CFSP: EU Common Foreign and Security Policy List https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fsd/fsf/public/files/xmlFullSanctionsList_1_1/content?token=xxxxx (to use this link you have to register with the EU to get a token number) CH - Sanctions list of Switzerland SECO: Total list of sanctioned persons, companies and organisations. https://www.sesam.search.admin.ch/sesam-search-web/pages/downloadXmlGesamtliste.xhtml?lang=de&action=downloadXmlGesamtlisteAction UK - Sanctions list of the United Kingdom HMT: Consolidated list of targets https://ofsistorage.blob.core.windows.net/publishlive/2022format/ConList.txt UN - United Nations sanctions list Consolidated list of the Security Council https://scsanctions.un.org/resources/xml/en/consolidated.xml US - Sanctions list of the USA CSL: Consolidated Screening List http://api.trade.gov/static/consolidated_screening_list/consolidated.csv The US consolidated list has entries from the following lists (more information): Department of Commerce - Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Department of State - Bureau of International Security and Non-proliferation (ISN) Department of State - Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) Department of the Treasury - Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\n\nThis is the description of the module \"Pythia_xmlimprt_py\" with the name \"Import and compare sanctions lists\": With this module, anti-terrorism or other sanctions lists can be imported into the Pythia database or updated. The standard version includes the comparison with the sanctions lists of the European Union EU and the United Nations UN. In addition to importing/updating the sanctions lists, a comparison is automatically made with the persons/companies/one-time addresses that are listed in a whitelist or a blacklist. If the information of a person/company from a sanctions list that is assigned to a person/company/one-time address from these lists changes, this assigned person/company/one-time address from either the whitelist or the blacklist is transferred to the checklist for re-checking.After importing a sanctions list, a mass comparison with the person/company/one-time address from the host database and the contacts from Outlook should be carried out immediately afterwards. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"Pythia_xmlimprt_py\" with the name \"Import and compare sanctions lists\" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select the sanctions lists to be imported or compared. The sanctions lists provide data on persons and companies blocked by the EU or UN. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"Pythia_xmlimprt_py\" with the name \"Import and compare sanctions lists\" regarding Personal data: In addition to attributes such as date of birth (only the first named is taken over), gender, title, function or language, the data on the name of a blocked function are the decisive ones for carrying out a comparison. Attributes such as passport number or nationality are not processed. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"Pythia_xmlimprt_py\" with the name \"Import and compare sanctions lists\" regarding Company data: For companies, a comparison can only be made via the name:.\n\n### Response: Based on the descriptions provided, it appears that PYTHIA is a software solution designed to assist organizations in preventing terrorist financing and money laundering by screening individuals and entities against various sanctions lists. Specifically, PYTHIA seems to offer features such as:\n\n* Importing and updating sanctions lists from multiple sources, including the European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the United States.\n* Comparing individuals and companies in the PYTHIA database against the imported sanctions lists.\n* Logging and storing hits found during the comparison process.\n* Providing a list of all hits and allowing users to transfer hits to a blacklist or whitelist after manual checking.\n* Allowing users to edit communication objects and roles associated with specific persons.\n\nHowever, based solely on the information provided, I cannot determine what exactly PYTHIA does. It is unclear how the software actually performs the screenings or what actions it takes when hits are found. Additionally, there is no mention of any automated blocking or alerting functions that might indicate whether PYTHIA is capable of detecting potential terrorists or criminals. Therefore, I would say that the answer to the query \"What does PYTHIA do?\" is not fully answered by the given information."

    "query": "Can I change the output currency of an order confirmation?",
    "response": "Based on the information provided in the module description, it appears that the output currency of an order confirmation cannot be changed. According to the description, the output currency is determined by the currency of the registered client, and the conversion between currencies is controlled via currency tables. Additionally, the description states that the output currency and, if applicable, its exchange rate is transferred to the print template, but does not mention any ability to change the output currency once it has been established. Therefore, my answer would be \"no,\" you cannot change the output currency of an order confirmation based solely on the information provided in the module description.",

This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_foreigncurrency\" with the name \"Foreign currency\" regarding Introduction: In a globalised economy one is constantly confronted with foreign languages and foreign currencies. In this section we will look at foreign currencies and describe how currencies are processed in the CyberEnterprise business OS. But first, some definitions of terms: The local currency (or standard currency) is the currency that is set as the currency of the registered client, i.e. the currency in which the client prepares his balance sheet: All internal values (e.g. all bookings and accounts of the accounting system (financial, operational and asset accounting) or statistical values such as turnover or costs) are kept in this currency. Foreign currencies are all other currencies that can be used as desired within the CyberEnterprise business OS: In transaction data (e.g. in offers, orders, invoices, etc.) and also in master data (e.g. in supplier prices, sales prices, etc.). The conversion between currencies is controlled via currency tables. The currency covered is the currency in which currency or monetary amounts are recorded in the system. The output currency is the currency in which documents (e.g. quotations, order confirmation, invoice, credit note, etc.) are printed. In outgoing and incoming invoices or in other documents whose values must be converted into the internal local currency, the output currency is also referred to as the conversion currency, since it must be taken into account here not only for the preparation of the print, but also for the transfer to the internal accounting system (e.g. when creating open items in financial accounting). In the following tables, € is the local currency and $ is any foreign currency. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_foreigncurrency\" with the name \"Foreign currency\" regarding Foreign currencies in sales: An offer/order or invoice/credit note can only be entered in one currency. The following table lists, among other things, the effect of a foreign currency on financial accounting and its open items (see also here) In all cases, the currency details of the order can be overwritten in the invoice. For example, order type C can become an invoice of type B, if the user so specifies. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_foreigncurrency\" with the name \"Foreign currency\" regarding Manual account assignment of invoices with foreign currencies: (see also: Manual account assignment) In case B, that is, if the invoice has been entered in the local currency but issued in a different currency, the issue currency and the exchange rate can be changed in the Manual Account Assignment window even after the invoice has been registered. If a different, possibly more up-to-date exchange rate has been agreed upon with the customer after registration but before posting in the financial accounting, this can still be maintained. If the invoice was entered in a foreign currency, the conversion rate can be changed in the manual account assignment, but not the conversion currency. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_foreigncurrency\" with the name \"Foreign currency\" regarding Setting the: While when registering an invoice, the conversion rate must always be set if a foreign currency is used (this rate can either be set manually or is set automatically (see also here)), this can be made more open during order/invoice processing. At least you have the options whether the exchange rate should be frozen or whether the current exchange rate, defined via the global currency table, should always be used for calculation. The setting, which should be used by default, can also be set via the options. When the documents are output, the output currency and, if applicable, its exchange rate is transferred to the print template. However, the specifications can be changed here for printing. When creating a follow-on document [[Quotation -> New quotation version -> Order -> Invoice -> Credit note], the print currency and, if applicable, the exchange rate are automatically adopted. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_foreigncurrency\" with the name \"Foreign currency\" regarding Foreign currencies in sales prices: In the section Foreign currencies as output currency (print currency) in sales it was shown which problems occur when converting from the local currency to the output currency(calculation currency of the order -conversion-> customer). In this section, the influence of a foreign currency in the sales prices on the order calculation(sales prices -conversion-> calculation currency of the order) is discussed. Local currency: currency of the client Calculation currency: The currency with which the order is calculated. (The currency specified by the net value of the order). Output currency: The currency in which the order is output (printed) and which is transferred as a foreign currency together with a frozen rate in the financial accounting. The problems to be considered include the following: The following cases thus arise for the use of sales prices in the order in different currencies. For all the above cases, € is the local currency and a fixed conversion rate of $1.25 to €1.00 is defined in the valid SALESFX. It can be defined in the client whether a currency table (SALESFX or local) must exist if the calculation currency of the order or the currency of a sales price in a foreign currency is used. If this option is set, an error message will be displayed if this is not the case. If the option is not set, the EUROFX table is used for conversion and the above-mentioned currency fluctuations occur. ",

If the invoice was entered in a foreign currency, the conversion rate can be changed in the manual account assignment, but not the conversion currency. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_foreigncurrency\" with the name \"Foreign currency\" regarding Setting the: While when registering an invoice, the conversion rate must always be set if a foreign currency is used (this rate can either be set manually or is set automatically (see also here)), this can be made more open during order/invoice processing. At least you have the options whether the exchange rate should be frozen or whether the current exchange rate, defined via the global currency table, should always be used for calculation. The setting, which should be used by default, can also be set via the options. When the documents are output, the output currency and, if applicable, its exchange rate is transferred to the print template. However, the specifications can be changed here for printing. When creating a follow-on document [[Quotation -> New quotation version -> Order -> Invoice -> Credit note], the print currency and, if applicable, the exchange rate are automatically adopted. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"processes_foreigncurrency\" with the name \"Foreign currency\" regarding Foreign currencies in sales prices: In the section Foreign currencies as output currency (print currency) in sales it was shown which problems occur when converting from the local currency to the output currency(calculation currency of the order -conversion-> customer). In this section, the influence of a foreign currency in the sales prices on the order calculation(sales prices -conversion-> calculation currency of the order) is discussed. Local currency: currency of the client Calculation currency: The currency with which the order is calculated. (The currency specified by the net value of the order). Output currency: The currency in which the order is output (printed) and which is transferred as a foreign currency together with a frozen rate in the financial accounting. The problems to be considered include the following: The following cases thus arise for the use of sales prices in the order in different currencies. For all the above cases, € is the local currency and a fixed conversion rate of $1.25 to €1.00 is defined in the valid SALESFX. It can be defined in the client whether a currency table (SALESFX or local) must exist if the calculation currency of the order or the currency of a sales price in a foreign currency is used. If this option is set, an error message will be displayed if this is not the case. If the option is not set, the EUROFX table is used for conversion and the above-mentioned currency fluctuations occur. \n\n### Response: Based on the information provided in the module description, it appears that the output currency of an order confirmation cannot be changed. According to the description, the output currency is determined by the currency of the registered client, and the conversion between currencies is controlled via currency tables. Additionally, the description states that the output currency and, if applicable, its exchange rate is transferred to the print template, but does not mention any ability to change the output currency once it has been established. Therefore, my answer would be \"no,\" you cannot change the output currency of an order confirmation based solely on the information provided in the module description."

    "query": "What is a packing list?",
    "response": "Based on the provided module description, I cannot answer the query \"What is a packing list?\" with certainty because the term \"packing list\" is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the description. However, I can infer that a packing list might be related to the creation of shipping documents for deliveries to construction sites, based on the mention of \"loading lists\" and \"forwarding orders.\" Additionally, the description mentions the ability to create packing lists for order items, production parts list items, goods receipt items, and material withdrawal items, which suggests that a packing list may be a comprehensive listing of all the items being shipped. Without more information, however, I cannot confirm what exactly a packing list entails or how it differs from other similar terms used in the module description. Therefore, my answer would be \"Information Not Currently Available.\"",

This is the description of the functionality of the module \"cxAccessoryList\" with the name \"Packing list\" regarding Option window: Here you can make and save settings specific to the packing list. The window can only be closed with the \"OK\" button.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"packload\" with the name \"Package list\": This module can be used both as a loading list and as a forwarding order.The loading list serves as a specification of a delivery note with regard to the packaging of the goods. If the goods of a delivery note are divided into several packages, containers, etc., the loading list can be used to determine which package contains which goods. At the same time, the package as such is specified in the loading list item, for example by weight, size, tracking ID. The loading list can either be printed directly. However, it is also possible to print it via the delivery note. In this case, the loading list number in which the item is packed is printed behind each delivery note item. The overview of all loading list items is then printed in the delivery note footer. The forwarding order is the order given to the forwarder. It informs him which parcels (forwarding order items) he should bring where (pick-up point) and where (delivery note address). Further information can be given using the text blocks. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"packload\" with the name \"Package list\" regarding - from the delivery note:: To do this, switch to the Positions tab in the editing screen of the delivery note and select the positions for the loading list there. Using the corresponding button in the toolbar (\"Create loading list with selected items\"), a new loading list with one item is automatically created. This first item now refers to the selected delivery note items via the predecessor-successor relationship. To create the next positions in the loading list, switch back to the delivery note screen WITHOUT closing the loading list. By selecting the next positions and pressing the button \"Extend loading list by selected position\" the opened loading list is extended. This process is repeated until all delivery note items in the loading list are swapped. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"packload\" with the name \"Package list\" regarding - in the loading list:: Items can be created in the loading list. These can be assigned as predecessors to delivery note or order items. to a loading list. It is also possible to pack an item in several loading list items. To do this, you have the option of specifying which quantity is contained in each of the different items via the item of the loading list. The items can also be arranged hierarchically. If you select a position and press \"Insert\", you can select whether the position is to be created below the loading list or below the selected position. in this way, several boxes can be packed on a pallet and these in turn in a container. In the tree view, positions can also be moved among each other. If order items are selected as predecessors, the items in the loading list are found directly when the delivery note is created and assigned to the delivery note. If a delivery note item created in this way is deleted again, the order is entered again as the predecessor. Input window. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"packload\" with the name \"Package list\" regarding List window: Used to list the loading lists.\n\n### Response: Based on the provided module description, I cannot answer the query \"What is a packing list?\" with certainty because the term \"packing list\" is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the description. However, I can infer that a packing list might be related to the creation of shipping documents for deliveries to construction sites, based on the mention of \"loading lists\" and \"forwarding orders.\" Additionally, the description mentions the ability to create packing lists for order items, production parts list items, goods receipt items, and material withdrawal items, which suggests that a packing list may be a comprehensive listing of all the items being shipped. Without more information, however, I cannot confirm what exactly a packing list entails or how it differs from other similar terms used in the module description. Therefore, my answer would be \"Information Not Currently Available.\""

This is the description of the functionality of the module \"partnerpflege\" with the name \"Master data\" regarding Preparation: Before the daily work in the ClassiX® application can begin, all master data must first be created. As all these data are related to each other in the program, as in real life, it is recommended to plan the creation of master data carefully and to proceed methodically during the input. First of all, gather all your data together, bring it up to date and organise it clearly. It is advisable to prepare the data in Excel, for example, as they can then be automatically transferred to the ClassiX® application. Any other structured file format can of course be used in the same way. Since almost every software application allows the output of your data into such structured files, you can also transfer the data directly from another system into ClassiX®. Please keep in mind that the new start always offers a good opportunity to revise your master data and its maintenance. Think carefully about which data you want to transfer from where and on which level and make sure that you can provide the data in a well structured way. It is equally important that you determine how master data once created should be maintained in the future so that it is always up-to-date. For example, where in your company should new customers, vendors, cost objects, etc. be created and who can and may continue to maintain them? Will data also come from other programs in the future, so that an interface is needed to guarantee the integrity of the data and avoid double data maintenance? If you have prepared yourself methodically in this way, you will see that the start with ClassiX® is hardly easier and faster. If you are already using other ClassiX® modules, everything will be even easier, because the data already created there will not have to be created again. Likewise, master data created in ClassiX®-Office or in ClassiX®-Financial Accounting are immediately available in ClassiX®-Office or ClassiX®-Financial Accounting in case of later extensions by additional ClassiX® modules. As the data is created in stages, some of the relationships have to be maintained. For example, you can only link the tax accounts to the client data after you have created both the client and the chart of accounts. Of course, all master data can also be created manually and maintained as described in the following section of this chapter. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"partnerpflege\" with the name \"Master data\" regarding Clients/company: When you log in for the first time in a completely new ClassiX® application, you have to confirm the login window empty, because no users have been created yet. Next you have to create the client master data, because all further data should be saved client-dependent. In the client master data, it is important to define the fields 'Number' and 'DB layer' uniquely in order to functionally guarantee multi-client capability. Number' is the client number used in the system and 'DB layer' for the physical differentiation of clients at the database level. The currency must also be entered. Address data and telephone, etc. should also be entered because the program can then refer to these correctly if necessary. Finish each field entry with the 'Tab' key and do not forget to save your entries with 'OK'. The client window contains several pages/tabs between which you can scroll by clicking on the title of the page. By clicking on 'Accounting' - or by using the key combination 'Alt'-'R' - you get to the third page where you enter which cost accounting functions you use in your company. When you have completed all the fields, you can enter further company-related data, such as bank details on the 'Additional data' tab of the new window by clicking the 'Company' button. You will notice that overlapping information does not have to be re-entered, because in ClassiX® all data is logically linked. Later, this menu item allows you to switch between several clients created in the system. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"partnerpflege\" with the name \"Master data\" regarding User - System User: This is where the users are created who should and may use your ClassiX® applications. The login name (user ID) and password must be entered. Furthermore, the personnel number and also a time limit for the validity of the login can be added. In the lower part of the window you can also define restricted access rights. If you have just created your login here when creating a new system, please log in to the system again. Since a real person should be assigned to the login if possible, it is recommended to first create the personal data in the ClassiX® partner administration. You can also do this later. In general, however, you should keep in mind that 'user' is only the role of one person, and one person may have several roles. If you first create the person and then assign one or more roles to this person, you can avoid double entries and you will always have your data well structured. However, system users do not have to be created as persons at the same time!. ",

Bank codes Postcodes.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"processes_rdbo\" with the name \"Master data - Business objects\": Basically, the master data in ClassiX® can be divided into company and personal data, as well as into the parts master. The ClassiX® system helps with comfortable functions for the initial setup of master data and its maintenance. Company headquarters People Part master data Parts life cycle.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"partnerpflege\" with the name \"Master data\": Setting up the master data Partner master data - companies, persons and contacts. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"partnerpflege\" with the name \"Master data\" regarding Preparation: Before the daily work in the ClassiX® application can begin, all master data must first be created. As all these data are related to each other in the program, as in real life, it is recommended to plan the creation of master data carefully and to proceed methodically during the input. First of all, gather all your data together, bring it up to date and organise it clearly. It is advisable to prepare the data in Excel, for example, as they can then be automatically transferred to the ClassiX® application. Any other structured file format can of course be used in the same way. Since almost every software application allows the output of your data into such structured files, you can also transfer the data directly from another system into ClassiX®. Please keep in mind that the new start always offers a good opportunity to revise your master data and its maintenance. Think carefully about which data you want to transfer from where and on which level and make sure that you can provide the data in a well structured way. It is equally important that you determine how master data once created should be maintained in the future so that it is always up-to-date. For example, where in your company should new customers, vendors, cost objects, etc. be created and who can and may continue to maintain them? Will data also come from other programs in the future, so that an interface is needed to guarantee the integrity of the data and avoid double data maintenance? If you have prepared yourself methodically in this way, you will see that the start with ClassiX® is hardly easier and faster. If you are already using other ClassiX® modules, everything will be even easier, because the data already created there will not have to be created again. Likewise, master data created in ClassiX®-Office or in ClassiX®-Financial Accounting are immediately available in ClassiX®-Office or ClassiX®-Financial Accounting in case of later extensions by additional ClassiX® modules. As the data is created in stages, some of the relationships have to be maintained. For example, you can only link the tax accounts to the client data after you have created both the client and the chart of accounts. Of course, all master data can also be created manually and maintained as described in the following section of this chapter. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"partnerpflege\" with the name \"Master data\" regarding Clients/company: When you log in for the first time in a completely new ClassiX® application, you have to confirm the login window empty, because no users have been created yet. Next you have to create the client master data, because all further data should be saved client-dependent. In the client master data, it is important to define the fields 'Number' and 'DB layer' uniquely in order to functionally guarantee multi-client capability. Number' is the client number used in the system and 'DB layer' for the physical differentiation of clients at the database level. The currency must also be entered. Address data and telephone, etc. should also be entered because the program can then refer to these correctly if necessary. Finish each field entry with the 'Tab' key and do not forget to save your entries with 'OK'. The client window contains several pages/tabs between which you can scroll by clicking on the title of the page. By clicking on 'Accounting' - or by using the key combination 'Alt'-'R' - you get to the third page where you enter which cost accounting functions you use in your company. When you have completed all the fields, you can enter further company-related data, such as bank details on the 'Additional data' tab of the new window by clicking the 'Company' button. You will notice that overlapping information does not have to be re-entered, because in ClassiX® all data is logically linked. Later, this menu item allows you to switch between several clients created in the system. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"partnerpflege\" with the name \"Master data\" regarding User - System User: This is where the users are created who should and may use your ClassiX® applications. The login name (user ID) and password must be entered. Furthermore, the personnel number and also a time limit for the validity of the login can be added. In the lower part of the window you can also define restricted access rights. If you have just created your login here when creating a new system, please log in to the system again. Since a real person should be assigned to the login if possible, it is recommended to first create the personal data in the ClassiX® partner administration. You can also do this later. In general, however, you should keep in mind that 'user' is only the role of one person, and one person may have several roles. If you first create the person and then assign one or more roles to this person, you can avoid double entries and you will always have your data well structured. However, system users do not have to be created as persons at the same time!. \n\nThis is the description of the module \"processes_rdcasts\" with the name \"Master information - Role concept\": With companies, persons and parts as core business objects, additional data such as customer, supplier, sales item or order data is assigned to these objects in the form of \"roles\". Rolls.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"processes_rdadd\" with the name \"Additional information\": For the sake of clarity, all master data can be classified as often as required below self-defined classification terms. Extensive functionality can be found with regard to the pricing of sales and order items. Classification sales pricing.\n\n### Response: Based on the provided module descriptions, I cannot answer the query \"What is master data?\" with certainty. The module descriptions do not explicitly mention the term \"master data,\" and they focus primarily on the creation and maintenance of various types of business objects, such as companies, persons, and parts, rather than providing a comprehensive definition of \"master data.\" Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query without additional context or information."

The checkboxes in front of the groups \"Other\", \"Customer group\", \"Sales area\", \"Price group\", \"Business field\" and \"Classification term\" can be used to hide or show the data fields. Data fields that are shown are changed in the customers by the Wizzard. These groups are not changed by hiding them.\n\nThis is the description of the functionality of the module \"partnerpflege\" with the name \"Master data\" regarding Suppliers - Creditors: Creditors are called up via the menu item 'Partner'-'Suppliers' or the supplier icon. To create a new business partner, click on 'New' in the opened list. The supplier window opens, in which you can now enter the relevant data. To edit an existing business partner, double click on the corresponding entry in the supplier list. The fields in the editing windows are confirmed with the 'Tab' key. At the end all new entries are saved by clicking on 'OK'. However, before creating a new vendor, you should first check whether a company entry for this business partner may already exist in the partner administration. If this is the case, you only need to add the role 'Vendor' to the existing data record. The number range is determined internally and can be easily set up and managed via the counter. However, the number ranges of customers and vendors must not be identical and must not overlap. Enter master data: Very important: Now confirm this master data with the 'OK' button! Otherwise they will not be processed. Then continue on the page ADDITIONAL DATA: Otherwise, add the points as required by the company. Additional information can be entered either directly into the fields on the different tabs, via the menu item 'Edit' or in the list fields also via the right mouse button and 'Paste': When your details are complete, click 'New' to proceed to the next creditor. Click 'Close' to close the supplier system.This is the description of the functionality of the module \"partnerpflege\" with the name \"Master data\" regarding Customers - Debtors: Customers are called up via the customer icon and created and maintained in the same way as vendors. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"partnerpflege\" with the name \"Master data\" regarding Banks: Here you create your bank details. On the 'Accounts' tab, you enter your account details with these banks and create the link to the cash accounts: If you want to use the automatic payment system, then you must of course enter all data completely. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"partnerpflege\" with the name \"Master data\" regarding Tax office: Enter your tax office data here. There is nothing special to note.\n\n### Response: Based on the provided module description, it appears that customer management is handled through the \"Customer\" module within the \"Partner Administration\" feature. Specifically, the module allows for creating, modifying, and listing customers, as well as assigning them to various roles and companies. Additionally, the module includes options for managing customer data related to sales areas, price groups, and classifications.\n\nTherefore, to answer your query, you would manage customers within the \"Partner Administration\" feature using the \"Customer\" module."

Through the \"Input Window\" where you can select a currency table by entering its ID (e.g., EUROFX) and confirm with RETURN.\n2. Via the \"List Window\" where you can view and edit existing currency tables.\n3. Using the \"Selection Window\" to choose a specific currency table to use for conversions.\n4. By manually updating the currency tables through the \"Update\" feature, either online or offline.\n\nHowever, without additional information about the specific version of the module and the current configuration of the system, it is difficult to determine exactly where the currency tables are maintained within the module.

If you want to load all the currencies offered by the ECB or if you had not yet defined a currency table in the system, the \"Table\" field remains empty and you will get a new currency table with all the exchange rates defined by the ECB. (This table could then be adjusted for the unneeded exchange rates in order to have a suitable initial table for the next update). In general, only one currency table may be valid at a time. This table is automatically selected and registered when ClassiX® is started. Therefore the start date of validity must be specified. By default the date of the exchange rate data is selected here. However, the radio button can also be used to select your own date. The currency table currently valid up to this point is automatically marked as invalid. It expires on the day before the start of the validity of the current table. Offline update The offline update works in the same way as the online update, with the only difference that instead of a URL to the data source on the Internet, this time a path to a file with the new course data serves as the basis. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"378\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} In this case (data source \"ECB\") the file \"euroxref-daily.xml\" in the directory Projects\\Data below CX_ROOTDIR is offered as a preselection.

The update can be done either online, i.e. ClassiX® tries to load the XML file and updates the currency tables, or offline, if no internet access is available. In this case the XML file has to be copied to the computer by other means and can then be read out. \n\nThis is the description of the functionality of the module \"cxCurrencyTable\" with the name \"Currency table\" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain currency tables. You can select a currency table by entering the ID of the desired object (e.g. EUROFX) in the \"ID\" field and confirm with RETURN. If you want to call up the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"376\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} The input window also contains a function for automatically updating currency tables of a particular name. This function can be reached via the menu item \"Update\". The sub-menu contains menu items for various sources with current exchange rate data (currently only \"ECB\" (European Central Bank)). Each menu item contains the sub-items \"Online\" and \"Offline\" (or just one of them), which allow updating directly via the Internet or via a locally saved file (in the XML format specified by the ECB). The two types of updating (\"online\" and \"offline\") are explained in more detail below. Online update When updating online, the new course data is downloaded directly from the Internet. For this purpose, a URL must be provided which specifies the source exactly (see also above). {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"380\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} The valid currency table registered in the system is offered as the table (to be updated): only the currencies specified in this table are transferred to a new currency table with the current values. If you want to load all the currencies offered by the ECB or if you had not yet defined a currency table in the system, the \"Table\" field remains empty and you will get a new currency table with all the exchange rates defined by the ECB. (This table could then be adjusted for the unneeded exchange rates in order to have a suitable initial table for the next update). In general, only one currency table may be valid at a time. This table is automatically selected and registered when ClassiX® is started. Therefore the start date of validity must be specified. By default the date of the exchange rate data is selected here. However, the radio button can also be used to select your own date. The currency table currently valid up to this point is automatically marked as invalid. It expires on the day before the start of the validity of the current table. Offline update The offline update works in the same way as the online update, with the only difference that instead of a URL to the data source on the Internet, this time a path to a file with the new course data serves as the basis. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"378\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} In this case (data source \"ECB\") the file \"euroxref-daily.xml\" in the directory Projects\\Data below CX_ROOTDIR is offered as a preselection. By clicking on the \"Select\" button, however, another file in another directory can be selected in a simple manner. With the button \"Start\" the loading process is started, with \"Close\" the dialogue is closed.This is the description of the functionality of the module \"cxCurrencyTable\" with the name \"Currency table\" regarding List window: Used to list the currency tables. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"cxCurrencyTable\" with the name \"Currency table\" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select a currency table. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"cxCurrencyTable\" with the name \"Currency table\" regarding Overview: For the management of exchange rates ClassiX®provides the classes CX_CURRENCY_RATE and CX_CURRENCY_TABLE. An object of the first class defines a single exchange rate, while an object of the second class contains a table of exchange rates. This table can contain not only exchange rates, but also other (subordinate) exchange rate tables. Currency conversion functionality exists in both classes, but a table is usually used for conversion.\n\n### Response: Based on the information provided in the module description, it appears that currency tables can be maintained in several ways:\n\n1. Through the \"Input Window\" where you can select a currency table by entering its ID (e.g., EUROFX) and confirm with RETURN.\n2. Via the \"List Window\" where you can view and edit existing currency tables.\n3. Using the \"Selection Window\" to choose a specific currency table to use for conversions.\n4. By manually updating the currency tables through the \"Update\" feature, either online or offline.\n\nHowever, without additional information about the specific version of the module and the current configuration of the system, it is difficult to determine exactly where the currency tables are maintained within the module. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your query."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhich attributes exist?\n\n###Input:\nThis is the description of the module \"attribut\" with the name \"Attribute (module)\": There are three attribute types in ClassiX®: Preset material characteristic Calculated material characteristic Conditional material characteristic You can find more information in the topic Features. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"attribut\" with the name \"Attribute (module)\" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain the attributes. It varies for the three attribute types, but behaves almost the same. Note: Characteristics are clearly defined via the data field. Therefore, each data field should only be used once, otherwise unwanted results may occur when integrating the attributes within the quotation and order items. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"attribut\" with the name \"Attribute (module)\" regarding List window: Serves to list the attribute objects. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"attribut\" with the name \"Attribute (module)\" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select an attribute object.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"attrilst\" with the name \"Attributes\": This module is used to list all attributes (regardless of whether they are of the type preset, calculated, conditional or table) or to calculate the value of an attribute that can be freely entered by name (in the case of calculated or conditional attributes). The second functionality is used from other modules, e.g. if you want to query the value of an attribute in a subitem of an order to check how the value is calculated from the characteristics of the subitem itself and the higher-level items. You can find more information in the topic Features. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"attrilst\" with the name \"Attributes\" regarding List window: Serves to list the attribute objects of all types. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"attrilst\" with the name \"Attributes\" regarding Test window: This window is used to calculate the value of an attribute object.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"attrisat\" with the name \"Object characteristics\": Each object (derived from CX_CONTAINER ) can have freely definable attributes that can be edited with this module. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"attrisat\" with the name \"Object characteristics\" regarding Functionality: This window is used to maintain attributes. You can maintain global Insert, change or delete attributes. Additionally you have the possibility to create new local attributes, which are then only valid in this object. The attribute data can be edited by double-clicking. You can change the order of the attributes with the arrow buttons. You only need to select one attribute in the list and then move it up or down using the buttons. A context menu for editing the attributes is called up by right-clicking. You can insert attributes of the following types: You can also find more information in the topic Features.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"atsetobj\" with the name \"Attribute lists (characteristic tables)\": Characteristics tables make it easier to work with attributes when you have to assign the same \"groups\" of attributes to an attribute set again and again. Thus, any attributes can be listed in a characteristics table, so that one only needs to insert the characteristics table. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"atsetobj\" with the name \"Attribute lists (characteristic tables)\" regarding Input window: This window is used to maintain attribute lists (attribute tables). You can select an attribute table by entering the desired number and confirming with RETURN. If you want to open the list window, you can select the menu item \"Search\". This is the description of the functionality of the module \"atsetobj\" with the name \"Attribute lists (characteristic tables)\" regarding List window: Used to list the characteristics tables. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"atsetobj\" with the name \"Attribute lists (characteristic tables)\" regarding Selection window: This window is used to select a table of characteristics. When the characteristics table is accepted, a dialogue window appears. Here the user can decide whether the characteristics table is to be expanded, whereby the attributes are inserted individually into the attribute set.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"attrisit\" with the name \"Subject characteristics bar\": The characteristics list of a variant part determines the characteristics which can be differently pronounced for the part. In addition to the use of the variant part itself, the variant part can also be assigned to so-called sub-parts, which are differently pronounced in exactly these characteristics. This is the description of the functionality of the module \"attrisit\" with the name \"Subject characteristics bar\" regarding Functionality: This window is used to maintain the characteristics bar of variant parts. You can create global Insert, change or delete attributes. Additionally you have the possibility to create new local attributes which are then only valid in this variant part. The attribute data can be edited by double-clicking. You can change the order of the attributes with the arrow buttons. You only need to select one attribute in the list and then move it up or down using the buttons. A context menu for editing the attributes is called up by right-clicking. In addition to creating a local attribute and inserting a global attribute, there is another way to extend the attribute bar, dropping an attribute. If a master attribute is dropped into a characteristics bar, it is inserted globally. This is different for local attributes which have been inserted in another characteristics bar, for example. With this type of attribute, a copy is created and inserted locally. An attribute in the attribute bar is only a (controlling) attribute if \"no value specification\" or \"attribute\" is set as type. In this case, the attribute may only be a preset attribute. Otherwise \"other\" attributes can also be assigned to a variant part, the \"Type\" column must remain empty. It is recommended to place all attributes of a variant part at the beginning of the attribute list in the desired order. You can insert attributes of the following types: You can also find more information in the topic Features.\n\nThis is the description of the module \"queryatt\" with the name \"Enquiry about characteristics\": You can search objects by their attributes (e.g. all parts that are black). This is the description of the functionality of the module \"queryatt\" with the name \"Enquiry about characteristics\" regarding Functionality: Almost all data in the ClassiX® system can receive additional information via so-called attributes. For example, an attribute could be assigned to each company, indicating how many employees this company employs. Another one, how many screen workstations there are. This module is now available, for example, to search for all companies with more than 40 workstations. It allows a combination of an unlimited number of attributes, which searches for suitable objects in the list from which this search was opened. All attributes to be searched for can be inserted into the list with the \"Insert\" button. After the insertion the comparison operators (e.g. =, >, present, not present) and the possibly required comparison values can be set here. They are linked with\"AND\". So if two attributes are inserted in this list, both attributes (as set) must be present on the object in order to obtain a hit in the search. Example: Search via the list of companies: Attribute \"NUMBER_OF_EMPLOYEES\", comparison operator \">=\" comparison value \"40\". All companies that have the attribute NUMBER_COMPLETEES with a value greater than or equal to 40 are found.\n\n### Response: Based on the provided module descriptions, I can determine that the following attributes exist in the \"attribut\" module:\n\n1. Preset material characteristic\n2. Calculated material characteristic\n3. Conditional material characteristic\n\nThese attributes are described in the section titled \"Description of the Module 'Attribut' with the Name 'Attribute (Module)'\". Specifically, the text states that there are three attribute types in ClassiX®: Preset material characteristic, Calculated material characteristic, and Conditional material characteristic.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the query \"Which attributes exist?\" is:\n\nPreset material characteristic, Calculated material characteristic, and Conditional material characteristic."
