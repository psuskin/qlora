Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nHow is this module called?\n\n### Context:\nCounters are used to maintain all number ranges (registers) used in the system. Counters are required for master data (customers, G/L accounts, parts, etc.) and documents (invoices, orders, purchase orders, etc.) in order to specify sequential numbering. The formatting of the number (e.g. whether with or without leading zeros) is also determined in the counter. Usually, the name of the meter is the same as the class name of the object to be numbered (e.g. CX_CUSTOMER for the customer number meter). The register of a counter can be delegated to the register of another counter. This is used, for example, if the number range for outgoing invoices and outgoing credit memos is to be the same. In this case, the counter for A/R credit notes (CX_CREDIT_NOTE) is delegated to the counter for A/R invoices (CX_INVOICE). A conditional table can also be used to distribute a register to several other counters, e.g. if the number range for orders is to be different depending on the order type.If you want to reset the counters for e.g. A/R invoices at the beginning of a fiscal year, you can create (copy) a separate counter for each fiscal year - controlled by the validity. In this way, for example, the counter \"CX_INVOICE\" for A/R invoices would then exist several times, each with a validity related to the fiscal year. It should be noted that the counter number should include the year of the fiscal year in order to avoid double numbers.\n\n### Response:",

        "output": "The purpose of the module loadeddlls is as follows: ClassiX® consists, technically speaking, of a number of executable files and libraries (.dll files, in the following referred to as DLLs). There are ClassiX® own DLLs, foreign libraries, ObjectStore DLLs and system DLLs. All DLLs are loaded into the address space of the process. This module provides an overview of these DLLs and shows where the DLLs were loaded. {img type=\"fileId\" fileId=\"406\" thumb=\"box\" width=\"100%\"} For each DLL loaded by the ClassiX® process, this information is output: DLL: Name of the DLL Sequence: DLLs are loaded into the memory one after the other. This number indicates when the DLL was loaded. Base address: Each DLL has stored where in the address space it should best be loaded. But if this memory area is occupied, Windows loads the DLL into another, free address space (O6MOP1.dll in the picture, this DLL collides with another ObjectStore DLL) Windows moves the DLL tacitly; nevertheless this process is not without consequences, because on the one hand the movement takes some time, on the other hand a moved DLL can only be swapped out via the swap file (otherwise Windows throws the DLL out of the RAM and reloads it later from the .dll file). Size: Number of bytes the DLL occupies in memory. Address area: A summary from the previous two columns for the sake of clarity. Original address space: If a DLL has been moved in memory, this shows where the DLL would have been loaded to if there had been enough space in that location Address space. Path: File name with full path. The list is only a snapshot, because during operation ClassiX® can load further DLLs, in which e.g. rarely used functions are stored. These functions can in turn reload further DLLs themselves. The sequence shows which DLLs were loaded first and which last. How you can see why the address space for ObjectStore cannot exceed a certain limit is explained in the section Address Space."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhat is the name of the module being described?\n\n### Context:\nAlong with cost types and cost centres, cost objects are part of cost accounting. However, the term cost object is also used synonymously with the term sales opportunity (marketing/sales), the term project (order processing) and the term internal cost object (e.g. R&D), depending on the specialist area. A cost object thus describes a business object to which a wide variety of inventory objects and a wide variety of documents can be assigned. The documents assigned to a cost object, i.e. the documents posted with a cost object can also contain costs/services. Thus, costs/services can be assigned to a cost object either directly via financial accounting or via special (cost) documents (e.g. time sheets). A company can receive different types of incoming invoices. The majority of incoming invoices are based on a purchase order, through which the invoice is entered in ClassiX. Thus, the invoice can be entered semi-automatically with regard to the data and an automatic invoice verification can be carried out against the order. A second type of incoming invoice are \"free invoices\", which are usually entered manually in the system without direct trigger/predecessor and therefore always have to be checked manually. By creating purchasing cost units, invoices for a maintenance, leasing or rental contract, for example, can also be entered and checked semi-automatically even though they are not preceded by a purchase order. Especially with monthly maintenance invoices, a manual run means regular, unnecessary additional work. The purchasing cost unit represents the contract concluded between the company and the customer.\n\n### Response:",

The normal quotation module is designed to record a quotation both commercially (sales prices, conditions) and technically (article incl. characteristics) in detail and exactly. A sales representative usually does not have this option, as he may have limited access to the ClassiX® ERP system. In order to support the sales representative in preparing and submitting offers, this module can be used together with an offline solution of the ClassiX® system. The aim is that the field service enters the budget offers via the offline solution and transfers them to the main database at the next online access. (In addition to the offline solution, it is also planned to record the budget offers via a web interface). The sales representative benefits from the use of the budget offers by accessing various master information (standard sales articles/ sets, sales conditions) and a uniform and automated output of the offer (forms). Due to the import of the budget quotations into the main database, the head office benefits from a lower follow-up effort of the quotations/orders and a better, more uniform overview of the quotations submitted by the field service."

Transient specifiers of the ClassiX® system, i.e. specifiers that are loaded from the *.DIC and *.INI files when the system is started, must neither be changed nor made persistent. Once created and made persistent, Specifiers can no longer be deleted. Specifiers that have been created and made transient cannot be deleted either, but they will not be present the next time the system is started. Making specifiers persistent can only be done from the list window, this is a security measure. For example, if you have created several transient specifiers and don't want to keep one of them, you can make the specifiers you want to keep persistent, restart the system and then only the persisted specifiers will be available.

The strategies for filing are defined customer-specifically in each case."

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhat is the name of this module?\n\n### Context:\nThis module primarily supports the sales/field service in preparing so-called budget offers (short offers). The normal quotation module is designed to record a quotation both commercially (sales prices, conditions) and technically (article incl. characteristics) in detail and exactly. A sales representative usually does not have this option, as he may have limited access to the ClassiX® ERP system. In order to support the sales representative in preparing and submitting offers, this module can be used together with an offline solution of the ClassiX® system. The aim is that the field service enters the budget offers via the offline solution and transfers them to the main database at the next online access. (In addition to the offline solution, it is also planned to record the budget offers via a web interface). The sales representative benefits from the use of the budget offers by accessing various master information (standard sales articles/ sets, sales conditions) and a uniform and automated output of the offer (forms). Due to the import of the budget quotations into the main database, the head office benefits from a lower follow-up effort of the quotations/orders and a better, more uniform overview of the quotations submitted by the field service.\n\n### Response:",

It is similar because different objects, for example of the same class \"CX_CUSTOMER\", can differ from each other by the number and type of data fields. Nevertheless, such \"similar\" objects are combined in the meta model to form a meta object \"customer\". This meta-object is then described by the totality of all possible data fields. Meta-Objects are created exclusively by the ObjectCrawler."

Furthermore, it offers the possibility to evaluate the commissioned, performed or still to be performed service of a production company as a whole (see option Performance). As a basis for this production planning, sales order items can be listed here by means of various global selection criteria (see Tabular parts, characteristics, other restrictions) or direct individual selection. The core data displayed includes customer, parts, quantity, price and date information for the individual items. In addition, the resource allocation (which can be switched on and off via an option) can be listed (also controllable via an option as target, actual and open times). Since by default a sorting according to the production date of the individual items with corresponding subtotals is carried out, a target, actual or still open debit of the production from sales orders is displayed, sorted by date.\n\n### Response:",

Events are used to define the working times within a working time model.They determine, for example, when the working day begins and ends and when or how long the breaks are.By means of these working time models defined in this way, the capacity of the employee can be automatically determined and saved for a defined period of time in capacity planning. The system then recognises, for example, that the employee works 8 hours on Mondays and Tuesdays, but only 7 hours on Fridays.In order for capacity planning to take these working times into account, the employee must be assigned to a time rule that refers to the \"capacity planning rule\". This is specified on the time rule or directly on the employee if the employee does not clock in and the working time model is only to be used for his capacity planning.{img fileId=\"519\"}.\n\n### Response:",

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nWhat is the name of this module?\n\n### Context:\nAlong with cost types and cost centres, cost objects are part of cost accounting. However, the term cost object is also used synonymously with the term sales opportunity (marketing/sales), the term framework agreement (purchasing) and the term internal cost object (e.g. R&D), depending on the specialist area. A cost object thus describes a business object to which a wide variety of inventory objects and a wide variety of documents can be assigned.The documents assigned to a cost object, i.e. the documents posted with a cost object can also contain costs/services. Thus, costs/services can be assigned to a cost object either directly via financial accounting or via special (cost) documents (e.g. time sheets).A (specialised) sales cost unit can be assigned inventory data of a plant (industrial plant, machine, part (e.g. for development projects)) and/or a business partner(customer, interested party, operator) or an operative partner(interested party, operator).Transaction data such as offers or orders can also be assigned to a sales cost unit. In this case, a \"project\" is thus the superordinate node for various offer or order documents. Usually at the beginning of a quotation or order processing there is the definition of a project, with specification of the external and internal project manager, the assignment to a plant and possibly also the determination of a first rough cost framework(order/sales planning) and a time schedule(network), which can be imported directly from a planning by means of MS-Projects and can also be reconciled with it.Using certain buttons in the toolbar, quotations and orders can therefore be created directly from a sales cost unit.\n\n### Response:",

        "input": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nHow is this module called?\n\n### Context:\nIt happens that goods are taken from the warehouse for a customer's needs, but only at this point is it determined that the goods are defective. Now, these goods can no longer be assigned to a particular goods receipt, but it must still be possible to return them to the supplier who most probably delivered this part. This is the function of the complaint document. This can be created directly for a stock removal or optionally also for a quality assurance document that has a stock removal as its predecessor. If the goods are expected back from the supplier, this can be activated with the checkbox \"Goods are expected back\", this complaint behaves like an order. The quantity is displayed in the dispatch account until the complete delivery. It may also be the case that the goods have been ready for some time at the customer and only then the customer discovers that the goods are defective and sends them back. In this case, there is the possibility to search for the original goods withdrawal document on the complaint document using the order number. A link to a goods withdrawal document is always advisable, as this is the only way to ensure that the material flow and cost distribution is 100% correct and remains traceable for later. Since a withdrawal document is not always available, for example in the case of Kanban or manual warehouse parts without warehouse management, it is also possible to attach the complaint document directly to an order header so that the flow of goods can be assigned at least to one order or cost object. The return loop is also fully integrated for this document, i.e. if a goods receipt is not perfect according to this complaint document, it is immediately sent back via a return document. The difference between the return document and the complaint document is The complaint document always refers to a goods removal The return document must refer to a goods receipt as a predecessor. The return document can therefore only be used if the disposition process of the part is not yet completed due to a QA or missing goods putaway or staging. If this process has already been completed, there is still the possibility to send the goods back via the complaint document. Business Process If no quality assurance document has been created for the removal from storage, the quantity made available is deducted from the parts requisition item/order item that may have been placed before the goods are removed. It can now be removed again via the staging list. If the goods receipt now arrives for an item that has already been made available in the meantime by another withdrawal, the status of the goods receipt changes to \"goods putaway\" and must be put away. If the item has not yet been removed again, the goods receipt goes to the status \"Ready\". In the case of partial quantities (requirement has already been partially covered), the goods receipt first goes to the status \"staging\", but after staging its partial quantity it changes to the status \"putaway\" so that the remaining quantity can be put away. The cost object is then credited by the goods receipt. If the complaint document was not expected back, the crediting of the cost unit can take place via an incoming credit note.\n\n### Response:",

This results in further subtasks such as checking the invoice, making the initial account assignment and posting in the financial accounting. ClassiX® supports this process by an ergonomic, semi-automatic capture of the incoming invoice. By means of an automated check, which presents the invoices to be checked directly to the respective employees for checking, the time delay caused by transport and communication between the departments/employees involved is minimised. Due to the assignment of the incoming invoice via the document history to the demand triggers, the initial account assignment is also carried out automatically. the posting to the financial accounting is carried out via the invoice receipt book."
